[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Romans chapter 5, we're reading from verse 15 all the way to 19.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   I know Elder Joe read that, but I want to read it one more time.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Romans chapter 5, 15 through 19.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   "But the free gift is not like the trespass.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   For if many die through one man's trespass,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Jesus Christ, abounded for many.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   For if because of one man's trespass death reigned through that one man,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   much more will those who receive the abundance of grace
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   For as by the one man's disobedience, the many were made sinners,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   so by the one man's obedience, the many will be made righteous."
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Let's pray.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Gracious Father, we thank you for the privilege that we have to come and worship you this morning.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   We thank you for the brothers and sisters of Christ that you've given us
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   where we can sharpen each other.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Love one another to keep each other accountable.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   In every way, Father God, that we would run this race together.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   We pray that the power of the Holy Spirit through your ordained word
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   would cause our ears to be opened and our hearts to be softened
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   and a strong will, Lord God, to apply all that you have.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   We pray for this morning that you give us understanding
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   that only your word would go forth in your heart and your mind.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   You know, it's easy to amaze me, you know, the more and more I see the technology advancing.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   You know, recently I was at a Starbucks and I saw this older gentleman who was there
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   and he was having some sort of a business conference or a business meeting
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   and he had maybe five or six other guys sitting outside and happened to be at the nighttime
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   and he took out his cell phone and he plugged in this projector.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   It was an all battery run and he was projecting against a little mini wall that he had
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   and he was going through some sort of a presentation with them
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   and I was there sitting and sipping on my coffee just mesmerized.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I know that that exists. It's not like I haven't seen it in the magazines before.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   But, you know, every time I've seen that I say, "Wow, that would be awesome.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   That would be such a useful tool to have." But he was doing the presentation
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   and they were probably thinking, "What's wrong with this guy?"
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Like I almost joined the presentation because I was so mesmerized.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I can't believe that you can actually do this.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   All of a cell phone and he was projecting.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   The whole thing was probably only about this big.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Cell phones about this big and then the presentation package was this big
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   and six, seven guys there listening to that.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I know some of you guys are like, "Come on, that's been around for a while."
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   But it was amazing to me because a lot of this technology that we have now
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   hasn't been around that long.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I think the first time I had a cell phone, not the smartphone, was probably in my early 30s.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And the internet didn't come in until about that time as well.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I mean, Esther and I actually moved to La Mirada
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   because it took so long to prepare for sermons.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I would hang out at Biola Library for about two, three days
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   and just grab a table and get all the conference,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   the commentaries and different things and spread it out.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And I would be there about two, three days.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   So when we decided to purchase our first house,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   we wanted to get it somewhere because I spent more time at the library
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   than I did going around doing other stuff.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And as soon as we moved, the internet came in.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And when I was getting ordained, my friends bought me a Bible program,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   a PC Bible program, and I realized, "I don't need to go to the library anymore."
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   I know some of you guys are like, "Come on."
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   But to me, it's still amazing.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Think about how things have advanced, the internet, the computer,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   and how life is changing so quickly and the impact that it's making.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And so many things have happened in recent history,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   but if you go even further, some people will say
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   maybe the Roman Empire made the biggest impact in history
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   or maybe the Renaissance or the Industrial Revolution.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Some say in modern history, negative things like 9/11 or the terrorist attacks,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   and these are having ripple effects on every area of culture, politics,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   maybe even economy.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   But I think you and I will agree, if there's one particular event
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   that has made the biggest ripple, biggest impact in human history,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   whether you are a Christian or a non-Christian,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   it had to have been the life and death of Jesus Christ.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Even if you don't believe that Jesus Christ was the Son of God,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   even if you don't really believe the effects of the cross,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   we have to admit that what happened 2,000 years ago,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   at least what is proclaimed that happened 2,000 years ago,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   made a tremendous impact on government, on our legal system,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   how we determine right and wrong, even what we study in universities.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Paul has been talking about for the first five chapters in the Book of Romans
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   the condemnation of mankind, that because of sin,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   because of man's rebellion against God,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   the world that you and I live in is under God's condemnation.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   So Paul is trying to answer that in saying
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Jesus Christ is the answer for all of these problems of mankind.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   All the condemnation, all the wrath of God, all the sins,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   all the death that reigned, that Jesus Christ and Him crucified,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   His one man in one man's act, reversed the curse of mankind forever.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   So the natural question is how can that one man,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   how can that one act of Him being crucified,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   and His one act of resurrection that happened 2,000 years ago,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   be the answer for all our problems?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   How can it have been an answer for 2,000 years ago?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   How can it be an answer today?
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And how can it be an answer as we're going forward?
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   The Hebrew 727 says, "He has no need, Jesus,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily."
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   So think about that as a Jew.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   The Jews were taught that if your sins are going to be atoned for,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   you have to bring sacrifices to the temple for every single sin that you commit.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   It had to be done daily.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   You couldn't pray to God.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   You couldn't worship Him without these sacrifices.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   They said they would come to Him daily, but first for His own sins,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   and then for those of the people,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   since He did this once for all when He offered up Himself.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Once for all.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   These sacrifices that they needed to sacrifice every single day,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   every single year, every single decade.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   He said Jesus Christ came, and He did it one time.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   And not only was that good for that one person,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   it was good for all mankind from that point on.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   How could that be?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   So, a couple of weeks ago, we talked about how Adam is a type of Christ.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Well, if you have a hard time believing that one sacrifice took care of this problem,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   then look at Adam.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   One sin from one man condemned all mankind for eternity.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   So he used that as a type.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And so in verse 14, it introduces Adam as a type of Christ.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   As one sin from one man condemned the world,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   one man's obedience reverses the curse forever.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   But almost as immediately as he introduces Adam as a type,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   he actually comes back and he makes sure he qualifies
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   that we don't take this comparison too far.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   So in verse 15, he says, chapter 5, verse 15,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   "But the free gift is not like the trespass."
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   In other words, it's not like that.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   So in some sense, it is like Adam, but in some sense, it is not like Adam.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   "For if many died through one man's trespass,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   much more had the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man, Jesus Christ,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   abounded for many."
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Again in verse 16, "And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification."
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   So he's a type of Christ, but don't take this type too far,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   because clearly it is very different what his sacrifice produced
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   and what this man's sin produced.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   So the first question we have to ask is,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   what was it about this one man's sin
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   that would be deserving of the condemnation of all mankind?
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And I know there's a lot of things that I wish that I could do over,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   especially around junior high school, high school time.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   There's a lot of things that I did I wish if I went back and redid it,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   because it had consequences.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   I was considering sharing some of it, but for the sake of time, I won't do it.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Some of you guys already know I used to get into a lot of trouble during that period,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   and some of those things had effects even as I was in college.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   But what one particular thing, what one particular mistake did you make
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   that you think, "You know what, that ruined me for life."
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   But the Bible says that one man's sin,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   one man and one sin in particular, ruined mankind forever.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   So naturally we have to ask the question,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   what was it about his sin that was so heinous
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   that all men would die and be condemned?
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   If you study the Bible carefully, and if you're asking and really digging through
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   the meaning of the Gospel, it usually will take you back to Genesis.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Because all the problem happens in Genesis,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   and all the prophecies of how he's going to reverse this curse
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   is all written in Genesis.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   So we have to go back and look at Genesis to see, what was it that he did?
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   What was so heinous about his sin that mankind would be under this condition?
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   So turn with me to Genesis 3, 1-7.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And again, if you have a vague understanding of sin,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   and why this particular event caused condemnation,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   then even the cross is not going to make a lot of sense.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Turn to Genesis 3, 1-7.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Prior to this passage, this is the record of the fall of mankind, these seven verses.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Prior to this, God makes it very clear to Adam and Eve
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   that of all the other fruits you can eat,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   except for the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   And if you eat that, he says, you shall surely die.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And God makes that very crystal clear.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   We get to chapter 3, where Eve runs into the serpent.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And this is the encounter they have.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Verse 1.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   "Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the Lord God had made.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   He said to the woman, 'Did God actually say,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   "You shall not eat of any tree in the garden?"
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And the woman said to the serpent,"
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   and I want you to listen carefully to what she says,
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   "We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'"
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Now what I want to point out here is that Eve knew exactly what God prohibited.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   And Eve actually repeated that if you do this, he said, "You shall surely die."
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   So there was no confusion.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   So Adam and Eve couldn't say, "You know what? His instruction wasn't clear.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   I didn't know what he meant by that."
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   And he said, "Well, he said not to go near."
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   It was just not clear.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   She actually repeats what God says to her in him.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   He said, "He said not to touch it, and if you eat of it, you will die."
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   So she knows it.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   But Satan's response, the serpent said to the woman, "You will not surely die."
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   In direct contradiction to what God says,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   "For God knows that when you eat of it, your eyes will be opened.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   You will be like God, knowing good and evil."
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   So he actually blames, he says, "No, God never said that."
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   In fact, the reason why he's prohibiting you from eating this,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   because he doesn't want to share his glory.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   If you eat of it, you're going to become like him.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   And God doesn't want to share his glory.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   So basically, you're not the bad guy.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   I'm not the bad guy. He's the bad guy.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   So you should eat of this.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   It's a direct contradiction, saying it's because of him.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   He's an egomaniac, and he doesn't want to share any of it.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   And so as a result of that, she hears it and chooses to believe the serpent
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   rather than what God said.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   And then look at the next part where she carries out this act.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Verse 6.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   "The woman saw that the tree was good for food,
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   and that it was a delight to the eyes,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   She took of the fruit and ate."
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And as a result of that, sin comes into mankind,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   and the condemnation comes in.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Let's examine carefully verse 6, what actually was the sin.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   She looked at the food, and it was good for food.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   How many of you had looked at a nicely--
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   you know, when you were hungry, went to a restaurant and said,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   "Wow, I'm famished."
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Did you ever walk into a restaurant and was hungry and said,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   "Wow, that looks good for food," and thought, "I better not,"
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   because Eve did this, and she died?
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   How many of you looked at the food when you were hungry and said,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   "Wow, that looks good. That's a delight to my eyes,"
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   and thought, "I better not,"
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   because that's exactly what Eve did.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   She was hungry, she wanted to eat,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   and she thought that's good for food, and she died.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   So I'm not going to do it.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   And then it says that she looked at it and said,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   "The tree was desired to make one wise."
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   How many of you are attending school to be dumb?
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   In fact, the whole book of Proverbs is about becoming wise,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   being a wise person.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   So why was this a sin?
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   That she was hungry, she found good food to eat,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   and thought that if she ate that, she would become wise.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   What was it about this particular event that was so heinous
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   that would bring the condemnation of mankind from that point on until the end?
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Deserving of what?
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Hell!
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   What was it about that particular sin?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   See, what went wrong in the beginning?
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   And again, I think the primary sin of mankind is contained in this text.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   The problem with her looking at the food that it was good
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   and delight to the eyes and desire to make one wise,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   the reason why that was sin was that it wasn't good for food.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   God said that it is not good for food,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   and she decided on her own, "It is good for food."
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   God said, "Do not go near, do not touch it, do not eat it,"
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   and she desired to say, "No, that is good for food,"
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   and it was delight to my eyes.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   God said, "If you eat of that tree, you shall surely die."
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   But instead, she said, "No, that's going to make me wise and become like him."
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   See, the rebellion wasn't simply that she was hungry.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   God said, "If you're hungry, you can eat of all of this,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   and all of these other things are good for food and delight to the eyes.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   All of these other things will help you to live and be fruitful."
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   What she determined in her own eyes,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   what she determined to be good,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   what she determined to be delight in her eyes.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   In Isaiah 5:20, it says,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   "Woe to those who call evil good and good evil,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   who put darkness for light and light for darkness,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter."
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   The primary sin of mankind is that this rebellion in our hearts to say,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   "I'm going to be the master of my own life.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Don't tell me what is good.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Don't tell me where to go.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Don't tell me what to eat."
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   That's why the Scripture says that what causes us to be saved
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   is those who believe that Jesus Christ was crucified, was raised,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   and that he is the Lord, to establish him as Lord.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Our primary sin is not to look at God and say, "I hate you, God."
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   The primary rebellion of mankind is to say,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   "I don't want you telling me what is right and wrong."
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   At the core of man's sin is he wants to be God.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Now, no one would ever say that.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   No one ever walks around, you know, Christian or non-Christian,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   like, "My goal is to be like God."
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Even though basketball players would put certain things under,
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   you know, tattoos and "Superman," "I'm God," whatever.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   But, you know, when we hear that, some of that guy's an egomaniac, right?
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   I think most people wouldn't have the gall to actually even say that.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   But at the core of man's sin, that he wants to do whatever he thinks,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   he wants to determine for himself his destiny.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   In the book of Judges, chapter 17, verse 6,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   it describes the core sin of Israel at that time.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   And this is how it's described.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   "In those days there was no king in Israel.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Everyone did what was right in his own eyes."
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Everyone just determined. It didn't say they chose what was evil.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   They didn't scour the land and decided to rebel against God.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   All they did was they determined for themselves what was right and what was wrong.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   That sound a lot like what's going on in today's culture?
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   We want to determine for ourselves what is life and what isn't life.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   What is sexually permissible, not permissible?
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   It's like, don't tell us what to do.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Don't be a bigot.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   We don't want God telling us.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   We don't want anybody telling us what we ought to do, what we ought to think.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   I mean, think about it.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   I mean, just even a few years ago,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   the idea that we can't even call a male a male or female a female.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Let everybody determine for themselves what they are.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   We may think, oh, that's a modern problem in today's history,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   but in actuality, that was a sin from the very beginning.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   From the very beginning of the fall.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   We want to determine for ourselves.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Proverbs 12, 15, it says, "The way of the fool is right in his own eyes."
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   See, a fool doesn't say, "I'm doing evil and I'm just going to do whatever I want."
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   He says, "In his own eyes, his actions are justified."
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   But a wise man listens to advice.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Ecclesiastes 11, verse 9, it says,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   "Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   walk in the ways of your heart and the sight of your eyes."
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Now, if I stop right there, I'd be like, "Great."
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   I've been looking for a passage in the Bible to help me to do whatever I want.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   It says, "Cheer in your youth, walk in the ways of your heart, whatever you see."
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   I mean, isn't that the benefit of being young?
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   If you ask most people who are over 40 and ask them,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   "What age would you want to go back to?"
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   You'll hear different answers.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   I've heard some people say, "I wish I was a teenager."
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Very few. I don't think I'd want to be a teenager.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   I want some control over my emotions and my thoughts.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   I don't want to be a teenager.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   I don't want to be too old either.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   I want to be just old enough where I have the maturity
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   and I have the freedom to do what I want.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   And I want to be just young enough where I have the physical ability to do it.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   So I would probably choose somewhere between 25 and 35,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   because that's where I would be,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   which is where most of you guys are.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   So somewhere in that range would be a good age to be in for eternity, I think.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   [laughter]
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   I don't know what it's going to be like in heaven,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   but that's kind of like the prime age.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   But some of the benefit, again, especially for you single guys, single women,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   is that you're at an age where you have a desire, you have the freedom.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   And I know a lot of the parents with young children envy you guys,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   because it's like, "Hey, that's a nice place to go."
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   "Let's go next Tuesday. Let's do it."
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   And you're gone. And then you come back.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   And then you see somebody else, like, "Oh, that's great. Where did you eat that?"
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   "Oh, downtown LA." "Let's go." "When?" "Right now."
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   And then they go and they come back.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   And all the parents are on Facebook, it's like, "Ahh."
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   I remember those days.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Who would think that that's wrong?
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   It's a freedom that we have, and yet, he says,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   basically, whatever your heart desires, whatever your eyes see,
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   just go ahead and enjoy yourself.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   But then there's a second part to that.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   He says, "But know that for all these things, God will bring you into judgment."
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Now, he's not saying that because you ate food and traveled that God's going to judge you.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   But basically, if your whole life is based upon what I desire, what I want,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   and I'm just going to live it freely.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   And that is man's rebellion.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Man's rebellion is, "I determine what is good."
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   "I determine what is right."
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   "I determine where I live." "I determine where I go."
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   "I determine what I say."
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   "It's me. Don't tell me what to do."
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   See, Adam and Eve falls into this sin,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   and as a result of that, what happens?
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Immediately, shame comes in.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   And as a result of this shame, there's isolation.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Even between husband and wife.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   They can't be open with each other.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   I know some of you guys who are single, thinking like,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   "Oh, if I get married, I'm going to share everything."
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   That's not true.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   There's a lot of things that you don't even want your wife to know,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   and your husband to know.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   That's the nature of sin.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   There's this isolation that happens.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   As a result of this isolation, there's fear.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   And that fear comes in, and that's what happens.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   They hide from each other, and the voice of God and His presence,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   that brought joy and life,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   all of a sudden, they hear Him coming near them,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   and what happens to them?
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   They fall in fear.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   And as a result of this fear, they hide from Him,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   the Author of life.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   And as a result of this sin, what happens?
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   The hardship comes in.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Where before, they were working, and it produced joy.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   And now it says, when you work, Adam,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   it's going to produce thorns and thistles,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   and at the end of your life, at the sweat of your brow,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   and what you've got to show for it is you're going to die.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   For Eve, He said, there's going to be contention in the home.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   That you're not going to understand your husband,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   your husband's not going to understand you,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   you're going to have contention with your children, raising them,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   and there's going to be hardship in life.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Soon as they have children, what's the first thing that happens?
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   The older son and the younger son, there's contention,
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   there's jealousy among them.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   This jealousy leads to hatred, and the hatred leads to murder.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   First murder recorded in human history was within the family,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   between older and younger brother.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   It doesn't end there.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   In Genesis chapter 6, verse 1, it says,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   "When mankind began to multiply, wickedness multiplied along with it."
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   And as a result, the Scripture says, "Sin reigned."
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Sin reigned. Death reigned on mankind.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   Not only then, today, and until the end of history,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   He said, death will reign.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Some of the questions that we get commonly
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   when we're trying to share the Gospel with non-Christians is,
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   "If God is so good, why does He allow evil?"
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   I'm sure you've probably heard that question from your coworkers,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   or from friends or family members.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   "If God is so good, why is there so much evil in the world?"
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   The answer is pretty plain.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   The Bible says the wrath of God is being revealed against all ungodliness.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   The evil that you see in the world is a direct result of mankind's rebellion against God.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   I think because the way that we presented the Gospel,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   we want to kind of skip through the first five chapters of Romans,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   and get to Jesus Christ died for you and loved you,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   and has a wonderful plan for your life,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   so they don't really understand why Jesus had to be crucified.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   So if God loves us, what is all this drama about condemnation?
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   But when we look at the Scripture carefully,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   the Scripture says we experience the Holocaust,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   wars, dissension at home, sex trafficking, poverty,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   all of this, the Scripture says, comes as a result of man's rebellion against God.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Death reigns.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Now if I stop there, if Paul stopped there, it'd just be news.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   I got some news for you.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   This is the state of mankind.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   I mean, what a horrific thing to hear.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Is it true? Absolutely true.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Nothing that I said is exaggerated.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Everything that I said is in Scripture.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   But that's not the point.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   See, the Gospel means good news.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   If the news stopped there, it'd be like,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   "Oh my gosh, what will happen to us?"
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   But good news is that God doesn't leave us there.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   In Romans 5:16, just as condemnation came through that one man,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   justification and righteousness also comes through one man.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   In Romans 5:16, "For the judgment following the trespass brought condemnation,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification."
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Romans 5:17, "If because of one man's trespass,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   death reigned through that one man,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   much more will those who receive abundance of grace
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through one man, Jesus Christ."
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   So we have to ask the question,
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   what was it about Adam's sin that brought condemnation to mankind?
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And we just took a few minutes to talk about that.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   But the next question we have to ask is,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   if Jesus' one man's one act reversed this curse,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   what was it about Jesus' condemnation?
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   What was it about his death that was so unique
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   and had the power to reverse the curse of mankind?
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   I mean, he wasn't the only one crucified.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Thousands of other people were crucified just like him prior to his death,
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   and hundreds and hundreds of others that were crucified after Christ.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   What was unique about his death and his resurrection?
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   Well, every man who was crucified and every man who died prior to him,
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   whether it was natural or through condemnation,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   died for their own sins.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   It was a result of their own sins.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Jesus Christ is the only one who knew no sin.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   And, you know, I kind of--
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   it's a fascinating question that would come up,
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   and I just kind of leave it to you to kind of ponder upon it.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   If death came as a result of sin,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   if Jesus never sinned, would he have died?
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Just think about it.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   I'm not going to answer that for you.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Let me ask one more time so you know what I'm talking about.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   If we all died because there was condemnation of sin, physically,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   physical death came in as a result of sin,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   if Jesus never sinned, would he have died?
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Just think about it.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Don't get a headache, but just have something to talk about.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   Jesus is the only person who died not for his sins,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   but for the sin of others.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   But if he was just one man who lived perfectly,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   then his death may only pay for another man's sin.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   But the Scripture says in John 1, 4,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   "In him was life, and his life was the light of all mankind."
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Meaning, contained in Jesus, in his deity,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   that Scripture says that all things were created by him and for him.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Jesus simply doesn't say, "Come to me, and I will give you life."
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   He says, "I am the way and the truth and the life."
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   He is life.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   So his death was a propitiation, atonement for all life.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   All men and women who are able to confess.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   And so he became a substitution for the penalty of mankind
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   because all life is contained in him.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   So by his death and by his resurrection,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   it reversed the curse of mankind.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Now here's the point I want to really point out this morning.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   But he didn't just simply reverse the curse.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Look with me in verse 15.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   And I want you to pay attention to the language here.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   It says, "But the free gift is not like the trespass.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   For if many die through one man's trespass,
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   much more have the grace of God and the free gift
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   by the grace of that one man, Jesus Christ, abounded for many."
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Now, when he says Adam and Jesus' death and resurrection
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   and sin and condemnation, the reason why it's different
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   is this one man's sin caused a condemnation for many.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   But this many sins was reversed by one man.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   The point that he's trying to make is,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   his power to save is much greater than Adam's sin's power to condemn.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   He repeats the same thing again in verse 17.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Look with me in verse 17.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   "For if because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   much more will those who receive the abundance of grace
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   and the free gift of righteousness reign in life
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   through the one man, Jesus Christ."
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Again, the language that he uses, he says,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   "death comes in, condemnation comes in, but much more."
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   What Jesus did wasn't simply that, "Okay, now you can go to heaven and live."
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   His power to save is much greater than the power that sin has to ruin.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   The power of life is much greater than the power of death.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   The power to justify is much greater than the power to condemn.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Much more.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   Whatever the condemnation, whatever the reign of death,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   whatever penalty that sin has brought into mankind,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   the power of the cross is much greater to overpower whatever sin has created.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   You and I have a tendency to look at circumstances,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   and we're good at pointing out what's bad.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   We're experts in it.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   That's why when you go to Kmart or Walmart or Target or whatever,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   their complaint center usually is pretty busy.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   You think about lines being too long or products isn't what it is,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   and the return line, whatever it is, the complaint department is usually pretty strong.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   I always wonder if they had a praise department,
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   if anybody would ever take advantage of that.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   If I was to ask, even in this congregation, "What is bothering you?"
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Usually they say, "Hey, give me a second."
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   And it's not because it's not already in your head.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   It's because it's so long, either I've got to pick from it,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   or it's going to take me a while to list all of it.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Let me start with my husband.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   My wife.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Now I'll tell you what's wrong with my first child, second child, third child, fourth child.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Let me tell you what's wrong with my work.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   My car.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   This government.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Donald Trump.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Hillary Clinton.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   My church.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   My shoes, my sock.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   The list goes on and on.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   You don't need to dig deep because our natural tendency is like, "Here's what's wrong."
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   But if you have any praise, anything to praise God about,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   "Give me a second, let me think about it."
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   We have to sit down and actually put some work into it.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   What am I thankful for?
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   What am I thankful for?
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   I've been thankful for the Bible for days recently.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Thankful for the Bible?
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   It takes a while.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   It's not there.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   You've got to dig a little bit deeper.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Because our natural tendency is to gravitate toward things that are produced by darkness.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Gravitate toward things that have gone wrong.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   Gravitate toward things that we don't like and we think need to be fixed.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   And usually that just kind of spills over.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   See, in 1 John 4, 4 it says, "Little children, you are from God and have overcome them.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   For he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world."
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   The reason why John says this to them is because there's persecutions happening.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   He said, "False prophet has gone out."
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   And he's coming, he's going to persecute and he's going to judge you.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   Don't worry about them, no matter what happens.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Because he who is in you is much greater than the problem that you see.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   These persecutors that are coming.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   A lot of people are so afraid of these ISIS guys who may--
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   maybe they're going to come here, maybe they're going to do this.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   And I can see them.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   We live near Disneyland.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   I would think if they're going to come here and target anything,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Disneyland would be one of those places.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   I'm not trying to scare you, but that's real.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   [laughter]
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   I say, "Wow, you know, all these things are happening and what's going on."
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   And so John is writing to a group of people who are in very similar times,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   who are risking their lives to be followers of Jesus Christ.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   And he says, "Do not worry.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   He who is in you is much greater than the problem that you see.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Don't focus your attention on the power that is outside of you.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Know that the God who created you is actually in you."
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   2 Corinthians 9:8, it says,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   "And God is able to make all grace abound to you,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   so that having all sufficiency, all things, at all times,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   you may abound in every good work."
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Think about how often we come before God and say,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   "I'm not growing because I don't have these things in my life.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Only if I had this, only if I had this kind of accountability,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   only if it was this, this, that, and I can't grow because of that."
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   When God says, "I have made my grace abound to you,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   to having all sufficiency and all things at all times."
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Not in this church, not through this organization, not through this program,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   not through this type of preaching.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   It says, "Every Christian has been given all that you need for a life of godliness."
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   So anybody to stand before God and say, "I am the way I am because I don't have these things,"
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   is basically saying, "You're not sufficient.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Your word of God that you've given to me in your Holy Spirit is not sufficient.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   I need this and this."
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   I have to confess.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   As a pastor, the thing that I wrestle with repeatedly,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   and I have to constantly catch myself,
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   is that in the context of ministry, I get frustrated.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   And there are times, and I dump it on Esther usually when I get an opportunity,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   and I would share about how discouraged I am,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   and things are going wrong, and this and that,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   and just lose hope sometimes for church.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   And I think in my mind, it's like, "Maybe this is not going to work.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Maybe I can just make money and then give it to people.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   That's something tangible.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Maybe I just go out to China or India or just get into orphan work or something tangible.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   This is not going to work."
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   And there are repeated times.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   There have been periods in my life in ministry where I thought that that was the way out.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   And I thought that was the righteous thing to do.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   I want to bear fruit, but I don't feel like I'm bearing fruit.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   And in times like that, I have to take a kind of step back and realize that this is His church.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   The only reason why you and I are here is not because God strategized the right people at the right time.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   And I'm sure God has orchestrated all of that.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   But when you look at 2,000 years of church history,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   if there's any miracle that you can point to in the 2,000 years of history
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   that is absolute evidence of His power and His church,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   it's that you and I are still here.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Over 1,000 years of trying to eradicate Scripture.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Over 1,000 years.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Not a couple of years.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   Not decades.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   Not centuries.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Over 1,000 years.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   The church that was given to protect and to proclaim the gospel through His word
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   tried to destroy this.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   And people who stepped up and said, "This needs to be translated so that more people can have this,"
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   were killed at the stake.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   1,000 years of this.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   How did we get here?
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Worship of statues?
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Killing anybody who was preaching the right gospel?
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   In the church.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   How did we get here?
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   See, Matthew 16, 18, it says,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   "And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   The only reason why we are here today is because Christ loves His church.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Because the power to save is much stronger than the power to corrupt.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   Power to justify can overpower any power to condemn.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   And that's why you and I are here.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   It's not because we found the right strategy.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   It's not because we found the right system, and the right people, and the right amount of money.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   It's because He said, "I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   So He says, "When the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed."
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   And if you believe that, that's why we worship.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   That's why we have hope.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   Not because we have the right people around.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Not because we have the right system around.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   Because God of the covenant is much more powerful than any other problem that you have brought into this room.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   Any other thing that has gone wrong, any health problems, any financial issues, whatever it may be.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   Our God is much more.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Considering all that is going on in this world.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   Considering all the overwhelming news of murder, sex trafficking, corruption, even in the church.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   That even in the context of all of this, Christ crucified foolishness to those who are perishing.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   For the power of God, for those who are being saved.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   That's why we worship Him.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   We don't come here because we have great people.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   If you come to church because people are nice, you will leave because people are not nice.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   If you come to church because a church is organized a certain way, you're going to leave a church because it's organized a certain way.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   If you come for anything other than Christ crucified, you will leave.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Because all things will fade away like grass.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   Hebrews 12, 28-29, it says, "Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken."
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   Because the foundation and the cornerstone on which the church is built is Jesus Christ.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   Not me, not you, not our system, but Jesus Christ.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   "And thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, the reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire."
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Let me conclude with this.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   When I was back in seminary, I took a book of Revelation, Exegesis through Revelation.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   Because I was going to be one of those top theologians.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   I'm going to be one of those guys, I'm going to figure this out.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   So I went in and took the book of Revelation, and my professor happened to be an expert on this.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   I got a decent grade, I didn't get like A+, but I got a decent grade.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   I was like, "Oh, I'm going to come out and I'm going to be an expert."
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   I came out absolutely confused.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   He would say, "Here's ten views on the horses, and here's four views on what red means, and here's five views on what white means.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Here's what the trumpet, and I'm not even sure, is it consecutive or is it all together?
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Here's a seal judgment, the bowl judgment, like what is this?
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Is this a nuclear war? Or is this a famine? What is this?"
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   Since then I've studied through it many times.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   In fact, some of you guys remember a couple of years ago, I told you I might study through the book of Revelation.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   I started studying it to prepare to teach in one of the Wednesday Bible studies.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   I went about two-thirds through it, and I said, "No, we're not going to do it.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   I'm going to wait a little bit."
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   One of the most encouraging things that I heard was shared by a missionary.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   We're not a theologian, but he was sharing his encouragement in Revelation.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   He said, "The book of Revelation is not an unfolding of mysteries so that we can calculate when Jesus is going to come,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   and so that we would know that he's going to be the pre-trib, post-trib, amillennialism, and post-millennialism.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   It's not for the purpose for us to just kind of wrestle with these things.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   I mean, it's interesting, and I'm not saying it's not important.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   It's in the Bible, so it is important.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   But sometimes we get so wrapped up in that, and we forget the larger picture, the bigger picture.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   The main point of the book of Revelation is to tell us that Jesus wins,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   that history is written,
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   that no matter what darkness and trials you're going through,
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   at the end of the day, everything Jesus promised gets fulfilled.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   If we were living during World War II, and we know the history about the Holocaust,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   and probably in modern history, one of the most horrific things that have happened,
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   how the Nazis killed six million Jews.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   Imagine if you were living at that time.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   Even if you weren't a Jew, even if you were living way over in the United States,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   and knew that that kind of evil was happening,
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   the kind of darkness that you would have felt,
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   the despair that the whole of mankind would have been under.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   We study that, and we look back at that, because it's done,
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   and the Nazis were killed, and they were delivered.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   So we can look back at that and say, "Make sure that doesn't happen again."
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   But it doesn't cause us despair, because we know what happened.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   The good guys win.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   See, the book of Revelation is the recording of history,
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   not foretelling, not "Hopefully this will happen."
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   It is the history that has been written.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   This is going to happen, because God has ordained it.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   And it says in Revelation 21, 5-7,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   "And he who was seated on the throne said, 'Behold, I am making all things new.'
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   Also he said, 'Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.'
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   And he said to me, 'It's done.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   I am the Alpha and the Omega.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   I am the Beginning and the End.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   To the thirsty I will give from the spring of water of life without payment.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   The one who conquers will have this heritage,
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   and I will be his God, and he will be my son.'"
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   This is not hopeful thinking.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   This is not wishful thinking.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   This is recorded history from God's perspective.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   This is what's waiting for us at the end of our life.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   Amen?
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   That's what Paul is trying to say.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   You could think about the result of the condemnation,
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   and what sin has created even in the church,
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   and being a husband and wife, and the sickness,
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   and all the trials that I know that some of you guys are going through.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   And sometimes the despair can be so strong,
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   and you don't know what to do, that you don't even know,
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   you can't even form the words to pray,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   because your heart is so burdened,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   that in the midst of these trials, do not forget,
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   that the one man sacrifice is not like the sin of Adam.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   Much more.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   Hope that we have in Christ is much more
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   than any despair that you and I will ever experience in this world.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   Whatever burdens that you have brought into this room,
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   his power to save us, to justify us, to make us righteous, is much more.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   Let's take a few minutes to come before the Lord in prayer
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   as our worship team comes up.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   I know that in this room,
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   and that some of you guys I know personally,
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   and some of you have brought burdens in this room that I may not be aware of,
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   but I know all of us, we are living in a fallen world.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   And because we live in a fallen world,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   the effects of sin is going to get to us.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   It gets to us in our marriage sometimes, it gets to us in our business,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   it gets to us in our friendship and relationship, and even in the church.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   But let's not forget, let's not be so short-sighted,
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   that in the midst of this despair, that we forget the big picture.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   Our Christ has conquered sin.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   If the Son sets you free, he will be free indeed.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   So let's take the time to come before the Lord
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   and to thank him for what he has done.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   So let's take some time to pray.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.340]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
