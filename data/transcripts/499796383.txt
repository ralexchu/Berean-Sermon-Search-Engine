[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.760]   Hi, I'm Ron, and my wife is Sarah, who serves in SEEDS, and this is my testimony.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.240]   I was raised Catholic.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.880]   It's pretty much by default in the Philippines.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.960]   I grew up in the Catholic Church all the way through the early parts of college.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.720]   Many things happened that made me question the sanctity of the Catholic Church, and by
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.040]   the time I graduated college, I was no longer Catholic.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.240]   I certainly did not behave like one.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.560]   In college, I lost my full ride.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.360]   I dropped my major and joined a fraternity where I began, or where I picked up drugs
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.360]   and alcohol.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.200]   I was failing in college, and in order to recover, I started taking ADHD drugs, which
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:51.000]   helped me go from a 1.34 GPA to Dean's List by the time I was a senior.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.600]   Felt smart, accomplished.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.680]   I had a success story, and that's all that mattered.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.360]   That success story continued into my career in construction.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.600]   In my first job, I went from making copies and filing documents to project manager within
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.400]   six months, but I continued to use drugs to help advance my career.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.560]   I had a list called the "How to be a Marketable Bachelor" list, and it was my vision to be
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.500]   the ultimate man.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.220]   Over the years, I started checking off the boxes on the list, but drugs always played
[00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.220]   a role.
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.300]   I worked on the list for 10 years, and at the age of 33, I was making more money than
[00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.180]   most of my friends, cultured in the arts, good with my hands, a nice haircut, no cavities,
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.740]   low cholesterol, wearing designer jeans, and I could sail a boat, yet I didn't have a
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.700]   girlfriend to sail a boat with, and was addicted to drugs and feeling completely empty.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.180]   But one day, I got an email that changed my life forever.
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.620]   It eventually led to my salvation.
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.180]   I was selling something on Craigslist, and during the transaction, the buyer invited
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.700]   me to a program that was just starting at his Korean church in Irvine, introducing nonbelievers
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.840]   to Christianity.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.100]   One of the items on my list was "Man of God" because of my Catholic upbringing, so I decided
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.520]   why not check another box?
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.320]   And I drove to Irvine from Manhattan Beach for this eight-week program.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.120]   During this program, I began to realize that the very manner in which I accomplished the
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.380]   things on that list was tainted with the existence of drugs.
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.140]   My success was a lie.
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.780]   It wasn't of my natural doing.
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.720]   I was trapped by addiction, and I feared that if I stopped, I wouldn't be able to continue
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.400]   being the person I've built myself up to be.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.520]   Each one of the items on that list was a mask that I put on, thinking it was going to make
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.240]   me someone of value, so I can be accepted and maybe someday loved.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.400]   I just wanted to take them all off.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.000]   The very person who I made myself to be was a product of sin, and I just wanted out.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Working on my "How to Be a Marketable Bachelor" list took over my life for 10 years, and many
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   years before that was merely preparation to accomplish the list.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.680]   I was a slave to the idea that I was in control.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:25.720]   In 2 Corinthians 5:21, it says, "He made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.960]   that we might become the righteousness of God in him."
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.000]   God provided me my only way out by sending me Jesus.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.160]   Christ became my sin.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.480]   When he died on the cross, he took my sin with him, and his resurrection is my new life.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.440]   During that eight-week program, it boggled my mind that about 20 to 25 people gave up
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.720]   their Sunday night for me and two other unbelievers.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.880]   I asked myself, "Who are these people?
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.960]   Why did they do all that for me and ask for nothing?
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.760]   What is this joy that they have?
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.680]   What is this secret that they all seem to hold that I can't seem to find?"
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.340]   I realized their desire for me to meet God was authentic.
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.340]   They were weird and kind because they served with this unnatural joy.
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.420]   The secret I thought they all seemed to hold was, in fact, the very thing they had been
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.360]   trying to share, the love of God.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.640]   I wanted to know the source of their unnatural joy.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.040]   In witnessing their relationship with God, I realized I didn't really know God.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.400]   So on the last day of the program, I prayed earnestly to meet him, and I wept for the
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.200]   first time in my life when I finally met God.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.720]   From then on, I drove hundreds of miles to attend this Korean church in Irvine.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.400]   Although I met God at age 33, I am amazed when I realize God's hand in the events of
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.920]   my life in the past, right now, and as it unfolds.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.800]   I believe there is a beautifully curated life that God has in plan for me.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.440]   Many times I have reflected on the events of my past, then realized how they affect
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.720]   me today, and I am comforted that God's love for me has no concept of time.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.440]   I believe the very reason why God brought me to Irvine was to find Sarah, and then here
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.880]   to Burien.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.320]   I believe it all happened in perfect timing, and I'm excited to see the perfect plan God
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.320]   has in store.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.520]   It's been close to 10 years since, but I was never baptized, so here I am to be baptized
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.720]   into Christ through immersion as the symbol of my union with his death and resurrection.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.720]   Thank you.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.720]   [applause]
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:41.720]   >> You can understand Ron, and you want the water, you're hearing his heart's intent, and
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:48.720]   when you come out, you're in harmony with his resurrection life.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:06:13.720]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.720]   Amen.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:14.720]   [applause]
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.960]   (applause)
