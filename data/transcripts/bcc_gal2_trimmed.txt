[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   >> Jamie Sabandi, can you hear me?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Oh, great.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   All right.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Let me pray for us and then we'll get the teaching portion started.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Father, there is so much in here.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   My fear is that it's going to be misrepresented.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And so I pray that you would just guide and guard my lips
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   so that your truths would just be indelibly etched onto our minds and our hearts
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   so that we would apply appropriately.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And so we pray for good feeding at this time
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   and that you would just align our hearts toward your word
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   and help us, Lord God, to both be in terror of your word
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   but also to be so delighted by it that we coming back to this well for more.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Thank you for the opportunity to just fellowship together through your word.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   We ask for your help to have ears that genuinely will hear.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And Lord, open up our eyes to see the beautiful things in your law.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   So as I mentioned last week, the flow of Galatians, there's three sections of it.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And in almost every section, Paul is upset.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Okay?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And I want to show you this, and he's pretty sarcastic, it feels like, in English.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   So in Galatians 1.6, we're looking at him just appalled.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting him
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   who called you by the grace of Christ for a different gospel.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And then in chapter 3, he goes, "You foolish Galatians, you dummies,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   who has bewitched you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Are you so foolish, having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?"
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And then in chapter 5, just to make sure that they're not forgetting that he's still appalled
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   at how they could switch, "You were running well, who hindered you from obeying the truth?"
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   So everything that Paul is saying, it's almost like a passive drifting into this.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Right? It's like they're being tricked, they're being obstructed, they're being hindered,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   and they are choosing, it appears, a different means to salvation.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Okay, so there is a general tone of dismay that we're going to hit just in a couple months,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   and then in 2024 as well, as we study Galatians for a while.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And so what's the desertion? What's the problem?
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Without fully understanding the specifics, here we have an insight into this.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   "You have been severed from Christ." That pops up into my head a bunch of different questions.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Did they lose their salvation? Are they apostate? If they're apostate, how are they called by the grace of Christ?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   So I have all these questions already, but I'm not going to go into that because this is chapter 5,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   and we'll let Pastor Mark deal with this in February. Okay?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   So, "You've been severed from Christ, you who are seeking," and that's a very strong word,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   "to be justified by law. You have fallen from grace."
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So this is a problem. They have been seeking to be justified by man's efforts to live according to the law,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   and they've somehow fallen from grace. So this is the problem.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   And we can't unpack everything that this means, but here's the problem.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Okay? And we looked at this last week. What is the gospel?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   It's basically news that sinful man can get with holy God.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Basic definition, and I'm sure you guys wouldn't disagree with it. You might articulate it differently, but that's what it is, right?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Holy, holy, holy God, where it's at center, we can have reconciliation.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   That's the gospel. There is a way. And it's extremely exclusive.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   If the Bible is the word of God, and there's only one way prescribed in it, it is what it is. It's exclusive.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   And this is what Paul Walsher says, "The true gospel is radically exclusive."
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Jesus is not a way. He is the way, and all other ways are no way at all.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   He sounds like a Paul, because he is. Alright?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   But that's, in essence, what we believe. If you don't believe it, that means you actually are holding to a different faith altogether.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   But that's what the Bible teaches. There is only one way.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And that one way is very specific, and that one way is very exact.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Now, even in modern day contexts, there's going to be a distortion of the gospel. It's not going to be a complete doing away with.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Right?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Most heresies contain 90 plus percent truth.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Because if it was blatantly erroneous, no one would believe it.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   But most heretical teachings have a form of truth, but just a twisting of or distorting of its elements.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   And why is that the case?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   My question for this passage is, did the Galatians realize that they had deserted?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   They probably did not.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Okay? So Paul's just having this very visceral reaction, but the Galatians probably are like, "What's the big deal? What are you...?"
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Because the distortion, they didn't catch.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Okay? So, we have to get this right, but we have an adversary that wants us to get it wrong.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Not in whole, but just enough to cause you to be holding on to a different gospel.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   So John 8, 43, describes a little bit of our adversary working through human means.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Okay?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   This is Jesus. "Why do you not understand what I am saying?
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   It is because, Pharisees, you cannot hear my word."
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   And remember, these are religious people.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   "You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   For Satan, he is a liar and the father of lies.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   But because I speak the truth, you do not believe me."
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   And that's Jesus to the Pharisees.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And here's an example in Genesis 3, verse 4.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   This is one of the first things out of his mouth to the woman.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   "The serpent said, 'You surely will not die.'"
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   No, not only did Eve die, she caused death to be part of every woman, every man, for forever.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Right? Okay?
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   So, Satan uses corrupt, distorted man to propagate lies, and he's always done that.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And so this agency of man is a very important topic, especially in chapter 1.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Okay? And I want to highlight some of the verses that we're touching upon either this week or next.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Paul, an apostle, not sent from men, nor through the agency of man.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Verse 9-10.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   "If any man is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you receive, he is to be accursed.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   For am I now seeking the favor of men or of God?
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Or am I striving to please men?
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ."
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Continuing.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   "For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   And later on, Paul says, "I did not immediately consult with man, flesh and blood."
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Okay?
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   So, Paul is basically pointing to a fact that there is God's way,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   and there is a corrupt, polluted, perverted way that man tries to hold on to, to access God.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And that is not God's prescribed way.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And I want to emotionally help us feel this by walking you through a very familiar illustration.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I bring this up at least once a semester because I love this.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Not the mosquito, I love the image that we can kind of think through.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Okay?
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   What's on the left?
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Who has one as a pet?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Kylie. Okay, she's, that's weird. Okay?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Does, do you know anybody that has compassion on the mosquito?
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Anybody?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   If I were to see a mosquito here and go, "Bah!" in front of all of you,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   would any of you report me to the authorities?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   No.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Why? Because this mosquito has no worth.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Right?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   If anything, it's a negative thing.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   If we were living in an area with malaria, dengue and Zika,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   you would applaud me for doing this. True or false?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   If I said, "Guys, there are mosquitoes in here, and they have dengue, malaria and Zika,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   before we start Bible study, let's hunt and kill as many as we can."
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   You guys would not disagree. You guys actually would join the hunt.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   True or false? True.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   If we saw, they're called pupas, all right?
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   This floor covered with pupas, these mosquito larvae that are gonna grow up to be bloodsuckers.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   I took a blowtorch and I just went, "Hoo-choo!"
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Would you guys applaud that or would you hate me for it?
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   You would applaud it.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   No one in their right mind, okay, would catch and release the mosquito.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Right?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   You're like, "But I love all living things. Everything that's been created by the Lord is beautiful.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   It has value. Pastor Peter, here, let me grab it.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Let me let it go." Nobody would do that.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   If you did that, people would turn on you.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   But what grace is, is you're not only catching the mosquito and you're not killing it,
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   you're gonna adopt it as your child.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Treat it like an equal to your kid if you're a parent.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   You're gonna let it sleep in your house, in its own room, with its own inheritance.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   You might give it a rat as a buffet, whatever it is.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   You will open up an account, which seems absurd, and save your 529 for this little thing.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   That is grace.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Now, here's my question. You guys have heard all of this up to this point before.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   What can a mosquito do to ever convince you not to kill it?
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Let's say it comes up to you and lands on your hand and does a little bit of like a "Hello!"
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Would that convince you not to kill it?
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Would four mosquitoes landing and they make a little letter saying, "Peace be with you," in little words,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   would that prevent you from killing it?
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   What if it landed on you and looked up with its needle nose and said, "Hi!"
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Would that arouse compassion in you?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Would any behavior of the mosquito ever cause you not to kill it?
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   No!
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   It would be absolutely absurd of you to entertain the thought that, "Oh, just because it did a little dance,"
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   or, "What if it brings you a little cauliflower?"
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Not a cauliflower. What are you, the dandelion?
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   "What if it brings you a flower?"
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Would you kill it still?
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   And you wouldn't think of it at all.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   But here's the problem with sinful man.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Satan has convinced sinful man that the distance between me and God is way closer than the distance between me and the mosquito.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Sinful man believes that I have more in common with God than I do to this mosquito.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Are you guys tracking?
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   The chasm between me and God is exponentially greater than me and this mosquito.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   So for sinful man to say, "I can do something to curry favor with holy, holy, holy God," is an offense.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   What God did in the history of humanity is He took this whole floor is covered with mosquitoes.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   He decided to take a corner and call it His own.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   Absurd.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   And He didn't just choose not to wipe out that little corner of mosquitoes.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   He chose to call them His own.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   "I will be like a mother to you."
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   What?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Does He have a right to choose what section of the room of pupa that He wants to preserve?
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Absolutely. He is God.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   What about all of these other mosquitoes saying, "How? What? That's not fair. That makes no sense."
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   "Every single one should just be blowtorched out and no one would bat an eye."
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   But for some reason, our God chose to have compassion on this little corner and to preserve away.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   The gospel message is that God provided a way back to Him.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   And that is an absurdity to where all the holy angels in heaven are like, "What is going on?"
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   "This makes zero sense."
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   And for man to be like, "Well, yeah, we did it. We earned it. We were beautiful. We were worthy."
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Is absolute blasphemy.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Are you guys emotionally not tracking along?
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Ephesians 2, 3, 4, "Among them, we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind."
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   "And we were by nature spawn of wrath."
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   "We were the objects designed to be wrath laden."
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   "Created just for wrath."
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   "But God being rich in mercy."
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   And that is an infinitely, wonderfully beautiful "but."
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Because that changes everything.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   But God who is absurdly rich in mercy because of His great love with which He loved us.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   And then later, He saves us, not because of any beautiful work we did, but by His grace.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   For what? Verse 10 of Ephesians 2.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Good works.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   He saved us. He saved us. He predestined us. He called us. He elected us. He will change us.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   He will glorify us. He will beautify us.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   All we do is in faith say, "Thank you. Praise God. All glory be to you because none of this is me."
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Spurgeon said, "Giving your heart to Christ is not the gospel."
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   "Salvation comes from something that Christ gives you, not something that you give to Christ."
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   And Martin Luther, this turned into a hymn.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   "Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing."
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   "Were not the right man on our side the man of God's own choosing?"
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   "Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus it is He."
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   "Lord Sabaoth His name from age to age His name and He must win the battle."
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   I mean, unfortunately, the music is kind of strange, this hymn.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   "Almighty fortress is our God."
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   That's why it's not as popularly sung.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   But this is such a beautiful hymn.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   A bulwark never failing.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Now I want you to look at something.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   God does it all.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Okay?
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   So this is a preview of salvation.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   "For I will take you from the nations."
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   "I will gather you from all the lands."
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   "I will bring you into your own land."
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   "I will sprinkle clean water on you and you will be clean."
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   "I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols."
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   "I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you."
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   "I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh."
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   "I will put my spirit within you."
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   "I will cause you to walk in my statues and you will be careful to observe my ordinances."
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   "You will live in the land that I gave to your forefathers."
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   "So you will be my people and I will be your God."
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   How many I wills are in here?
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   A bunch.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Salvation is not of man.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Salvation is not man's effort in any way, shape, or form.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   It is 100% God's grace, God's kindness.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Hallelujah.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   You guys understand?
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Okay?
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   God has done a spiritual heart transplant in you if you are a child of God.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   It cannot be reversed.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   It cannot be undone.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   It is not something that you made an effort to have.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   You did not change your heart.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   God did it.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   You are not a creator.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   He is creator and you are creation, but you're new.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   The old things have passed away.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   The whole new things have come.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   So new creations will look like new creations.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   They will not indulge the same things of yesteryear.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   They are brand new.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   There will be works, but salvation is not from these works.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   It is a byproduct.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Okay?
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   But sometimes in our folly, we want to manipulate details of our lives
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   to prove to God, to prove to others that we can save ourselves,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   that we can improve our lot,
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   that we can make ourselves more beautiful to God than that person.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Folly.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   So what is the gospel?
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   How are we saved?
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Grace through faith plus nothing else.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   But when God grabs your heart and changes it, will there be results?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Yes or no?
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Yes.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Okay?
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   And this is going to be the tension in the book of Galatians.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Where does works play into my salvation?
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Right?
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Nod your heads if you know that there is that tension coming.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Okay?
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   The Bible started parking announcements.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   So that is the teaching portion.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   The mosquito illustration.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Greater distance between me and God or me and the mosquito?
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Between me and God.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   There is nothing, just as much as there is nothing a mosquito can do
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   to convince me not just not to kill it, but to adopt it as my child.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Even more so, infinitesimally more so,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   there is nothing that you can do to please God in your own efforts.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   It has to be completely His grace.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   And that is why we give praise.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   We serve a very strange God who would do such a thing.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Imagine if Kylie did take home a mosquito and give it a name
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   and put makeup on it and stuff.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   That is nothing compared to what God did to Jesus on the cross for our sake.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   You guys follow?
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Okay?
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Some announcements that I am going to repeat a little bit.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   We have a lot of people here.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   So men--oh, he didn't announce it on Facebook today,
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   so maybe we could sneak in the parking spot.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   No, please don't do that.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Save the closer spots for our ladies.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   And then, you know, you guys will walk a little bit farther.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Okay?
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Same thing, no parking on Wednesdays over here or on the street.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   And if you get here before 5, don't park in our neighbor's lots.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   But here's a very important announcement for parking.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   You heard it on Sunday from Pastor Peter.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   The Kimco lot here, okay, and then this cafe building lot here,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   we are going to designate it on Sundays for families with small children only.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Part of it is we do not want our kids crossing the street at all.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Not just--you would understand why.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   And even if you're driving 15 miles an hour, a kid can just dart in.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   All it takes is one bad incident, and we have a lot of kids now running around there,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   and we're trying to remedy this thing.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   But for now, if you guys are able, don't park here so that we can have the kids
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   not have to ever cross the street if that's by all means avoidable.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Cool? Okay?
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   And just because there aren't people, like, watching you, you know,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   God is always watching.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   So please do.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   And then if you are a parent, one of the things is we have a lot of kids
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   jumping across the little AstroTurf hill and playing on the sidewalk.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Please watch your kid if you are a parent.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   We are going to try to figure out ways where your kids can play in a safer area.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   But for the time being, I know you love to talk to people, but watch your kid first.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   That's one that we do have a request for.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Men, we're having a workshop.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   Ignore the galbijjim part.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   We're having a workshop where we're going to be spiritually fed with spiritual meat.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   And then we're going to learn how to share spiritual meat with one another
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   through the topic of accountability.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   And then if you want to donate $10 for the real meat, then we--I mean, not the real meat,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   like cow meat, then we'll have that for lunch.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   But today is the last day to sign up.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   And then I'm putting the groups together with Pastor Peter tomorrow morning.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   So if you want, you can do this right now if you haven't signed up already.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   And if you haven't paid, please remember to pay.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   Someone told me to announce something that I completely now don't remember what it was.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Who told me to announce something?
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Alex, what was it that you wanted me to announce?
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Her babysitting and her facility prep and clean up.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   Yes.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   So we do need a lot of help setting the tables up, setting the chairs up for Bible study.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   So there is a sign-up sheet that all the small--actually, you should have access to.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   It's that first email that you got.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Please sign up to help with something if you can.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   We need help babysitting because we do have a lot of parents who are actually here on site right now with their kids.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   But in order to alleviate some of the burdens of them missing so much of the Bible study to watch the kids,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   it would help for all of us to kind of go around and watch the kids.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   So if you can do that, please sign up for that.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   And there's other things you can sign up for on that initial email that you received.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Okay?
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   So here's a couple of prep questions for next week.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Read and prepare 11 to 17.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   The following weeks is going to feel a lot shorter, but the break was at verse 17.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   So this one is going to feel a lot more wordy, but content-wise it's not a lot.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Okay?
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   So 11 to 17, and one thing that you want to keep in mind as you're preparing is what does Paul's conversion--
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   and this is his longest autobiography, this whole section.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   In the whole of Scriptures, this is the most he writes about himself.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   What does Paul's conversion reveal about the gospel of Christ?
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Okay?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   And then what role did Paul play in his own salvation?
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   I kind of gave it away with the mosquito illustration, but try to discern that from the text.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Okay?
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   And I'm going to post these up on Facebook either tonight or tomorrow morning with the verses.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   This is your group's discussion.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Do you tend to wrestle more with legalism or antinomianism?
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   If you don't know what antinomianism means, just think of it as like just, you know, one save, always save.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Whatever I do doesn't affect anything.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   It's like no law in my life.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Okay?
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   So which way do you--which way does your pendulum swing?
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   What are the potential errors in your understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ?
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   Okay?
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Second, do you struggle with the assurance of salvation?
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Through Galatians, it could be a genuine question like, "Did I get here by my effort or did God save me?"
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   How do I know?
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   If so, what are the things that cause that struggle?
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   And then how do you help someone who is struggling with doubt?
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Remember, if you get the gospel wrong--I'm not going to say that.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   So how do you help someone struggling with doubt?
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   Do you give them false hope?
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Okay?
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   How do you help?
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   And then how do you make sure you do not compromise the gospel in your efforts to help him or her?
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   And then lastly, in what ways can your group members help you grow in becoming a better bond servant of Christ?
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   All right, let me pray.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Father, we thank you for just reminding us afresh that you are holy and that you are beyond our comprehension.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   And it is very strange that you would be such a God of grace and kindness and mercy and compassion.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   But I pray that as we reflect on it, cause us to be in awe, wonder, and reverence.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   And in response, Lord, help us to fall down in adoration and worship.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   And in application, help us to grow to have the same compassion towards those around us.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   So Lord, would you empower us to preach the good news of Christ, even if it is foolishness, to those who are perishing?
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Because there are many who you will save through your gospel truth.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   So we pray, Father, for your help that we would feed well off of these truths and apply it powerfully in our lives.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   For your glory and for our joy.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   And we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
