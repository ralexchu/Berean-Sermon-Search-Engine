[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   >> All right, good morning.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Hope you guys are staying safe and healthy.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   We have a few announcements before we get started.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   We have an announcement from our sisters ministry,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   so Grace is going to come up and give the announcement first.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   >> Good morning, everyone.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Starting mid-February, we're going to be starting an intentional
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   sisters fellowship, so it's ISF.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   This is an opportunity for BAM and family ministry sisters.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   We'll be reading through Choosing Gratitude,
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Your Journey to Joy by Nancy Lee DeMoss.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   And our prayer is that through reading this book,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   we can find true happiness based on growing a heart of humble
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   thankfulness and joy provided by the freedom that we have in Christ.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Because in our Savior, our joy is truly full.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   And this will be a biweekly commitment taking place in person.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   We have two options.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   One is on Friday mornings from 9.30 to 11.30.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   And then the second option is for Monday evenings.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   And that time will be determined by each small group.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   And if you could sign up, the deadline is by Sunday, February 6th.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Thank you.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   >> Okay, so as you guys know, our First Peter Bible study is starting this week.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   And so the home groups and the small groups have been set.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   So if you have not gotten an email from the home group leads,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   you probably should have.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   So please contact us if you didn't.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   And then we'll make sure that if you weren't added,
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   that we add you to the appropriate place.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   And so it's starting this Wednesday for the Wednesday group and all the home groups.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   And I think you probably got an email to tell you when that's starting and what time.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Okay?
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Members meeting today at 2.30.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   So that gives you enough time to go get lunch and then come back.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   And because it is the beginning of the year,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   there's quite a few things that we need to cover today.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   And then if you are not able to make it,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   and obviously today is unique because there's a lot of people who are going to be online.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   And so usually we don't do the live streaming,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   but today for some of the people who are not able to come,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   but we do have a covenant renewal because this is our first of the year.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   And those of you who are members of the church, we have a covenant renewal signing every year.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   So if you didn't get a chance to do that, please do so.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   If you can't do it today because you're at church,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   and to make sure that you do that earlier part of this week, hopefully today if possible,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   and to fill that out, whatever you got from that sheet, as accurately as possible.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   You don't need to write a dissertation,
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   but just kind of explaining the covenants and where you are with that, with the ten covenants.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   And then that helps us to evaluate what's going on at church
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   and how to focus on certain things and strengthening certain things.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   So if you haven't been able to do that, please do so.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Okay?
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   And again, the meeting is going to start 2.30 sharp.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Spiritual development courses, again, I'm not going to go over that,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   but if you want to, that's going to start in February.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Also, one last thing is in February 5th, from 1 to 2, there's going to be an evangelism outing.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   So they're doing it once a month, it seems like at the beginning of the month.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   And one's in Brenner Park at the Source Mall, and the other one's at Irvine Spectrum.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   And again, I want to encourage you, if you haven't done this before
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   or you're not in the habit of doing that, sharing your faith,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   this is a great opportunity to exercise your muscles, your spiritual muscles of sharing the gospel.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   And so if you're intimidated by going out and talking to strangers,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   I'm sure they'll connect you with other people who are--
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   and you can come there and kind of learn how to do that,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   or at least just be there and listen to the conversation if that's where you are.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   So we encourage you to come and sign up for that if you are available at that time.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Let me pray for us, and then we'll give you an opportunity to give the offering.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   For those of you who are new to the church, you have a physical offering.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   We have a physical offering box underneath that big clock over there.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Okay? Let me pray.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Heavenly Father, we want to praise you and thank you for your goodness in our lives,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   that in the midst of all the stuff that's going on around us,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   help us truly be anchored in Christ,
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   that our peace, Lord God, would not simply be based upon just wishful thinking,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   but that our faith may be exercised in the midst of all of these things, Lord God,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   that you truly would be our refuge.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   We pray that this morning that whatever it is that we've been entangled with,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   help us, Lord God, to focus our attention on you,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   to praise and worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   We pray for the offering that we give to you.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Help us to give it to you with a cheerful heart.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   It may be multiplied for your use.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   If you could turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 13.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   We're going to be looking at verse 15 and 16.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Hebrews chapter 13 verse 15 and 16.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   that is the fruit of lips that give thanks to his name.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   And do not neglect doing good and sharing,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   for with such sacrifices God is pleased.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   Let's pray.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Heavy Father we pray that you would bless this time,
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   and that we would not turn from your word to the left or to the right,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   that we would neither add nor subtract from your word,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   that you would send it Lord God to soften,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   encourage, rebuke, and strengthen the hearts of men and women Lord God who have come to hear,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   asking for your grace in Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   If you grew up in a Presbyterian church,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   and they taught you the Westminster Catechism,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   you'll probably already know that the very first and the most important part of the Catechism,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   begins by this question, what is the chief end of man?
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Chief end of man.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   So this is the first thing that you learn in the Catechism when they ask you,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   what is your purpose in other words?
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   What is the most important thing that God desires of us that we should be pursuing?
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   And the answer to that question in the Catechism is,
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   man's chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   His chief end.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Not to say that that's the only end,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   but it's the most important thing that we are to pursue.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   Now, basically this is the summary of everything that we're trying to do.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Whether you're a Presbyterian or not,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   the Catechism basically summarizes for us what is important.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Why are we saved? Why are we here?
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Why do we study the Bible? Why do we pray?
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Why did Christ suffer? What is the point of eternity?
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   All of it is summarized in that statement.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Man's chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   It's to praise him, to magnify him, to worship him.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   C.S. Lewis, on this reflection of praise,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   where he kind of shares how he was really hung up on this idea of how,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   you know, in every other instance where we are told to humble ourselves,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Jesus says that he who is the greatest in the kingdom of God is the one who is served,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   who is the least.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   If you want to live, you have to learn to die.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   And yet when it comes to God, he says to glorify him, magnify him,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   to worship him and worship no other.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   And so he kind of, he had a difficult time understanding this.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   And this is the reflection that he found on this subject.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   C.S. Lewis says on a reflection on Psalms praising God, it says,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   "The most obvious fact about praise, whether of God or anything, strangely escaped me.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   I thought of it in terms of compliment, approval, or giving of honor.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   I had never noticed that all enjoyment spontaneously overflows into praise.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   The world rings with praise, lovers praising their mistresses, readers their favorite poet,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   walkers praising the countryside players, praising their favorite game, and etc."
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   And so the point that he's trying to make is when we see it from our perspective is like,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   "Oh, God wants to praise. He wants to be honored. He wants to be put on a pedestal."
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   But in reality, what God is basically saying,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   "The chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy him forever,"
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   is that our appreciation, our restoration of this relationship
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   would lead to an abundance of joy that leads to praise.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   And that's exactly what Jesus says.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   When he says in John 10:10 that, "I have come to give life and to give this life abundantly,"
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   that life there isn't bios, isn't just eternity,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   because according to Scripture, everyone has eternity.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Whether you have eternity in heaven, whether you have eternity in hell,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   the Bible says everyone has eternity.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   He didn't come so that we would have eternity.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   He says he came so that we may have zoe, to be alive.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   And again, whenever you think of being alive, you're talking about joy.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   You're talking about praise.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   And so Jesus says that he came to give us this joy, this life.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   John 4:23, when Jesus is interacting with the Samaritan woman,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Jesus summarizes their conversation, and he says,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   "There's going to come a time whether you worship in this mountain or that mountain,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   it's not going to matter."
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   What he's looking for, what he's searching for,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   are people who will worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   So true worshipers are what he is seeking.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   The whole point of salvation is because we lost the ability to worship
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   when we rebelled against God.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   The Bible described it as us falling short of God's glory.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   So the whole point of salvation is to restore us so that we may reflect that glory again,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   to be true worshipers.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   So discipleship is to make worshipers of God.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Discipleship isn't simply going out, sharing the gospel,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   and people who didn't go to church to come to church.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   It's not people who didn't read the Bible to read the Bible.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   If you didn't pray, for you to pray.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   The whole purpose of salvation is to get people who couldn't worship God
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   to be worshipers of God.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   You can have people who are very diligent, very disciplined,
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   very active in pursuing holiness and not be in worship of God.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   The Bible makes it very clear.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   That is his primary passion.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   That is his primary pursuit.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   And that's the primary thing that he is looking for in us.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Are we true worshipers?
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   The text that we're looking at this morning in verse 15 and 16,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   there are four things that I want to highlight about true worship that he seeks.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   The first thing is worship is what Jesus came to restore.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Worship, first and foremost, is what he came to restore.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   When we think of salvation, sometimes we think of salvation as not dying,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   not going to hell.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   And then so we imagine what heaven would be like,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   but the primary thing that Jesus says is that he came to restore proper worship.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   In 1 Peter 2 verse 9, it says, "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   a holy nation, a people for God's own possession,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   so that the reason why Jesus did everything that he did is so that you may proclaim
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light."
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   Everything that he's done for us, everything he's given us,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   the reason why we belong to him is to make us worshipers of him again.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   Whole reason why you and I have been created was to bear his image,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   to reflect his glory, to praise and worship him.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   But because of our rebellion, because of our sin,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   he said we've fallen short of that glory.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   So the whole reason why Jesus came, and that's why he says, "Through him give praise."
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   That was the whole purpose of the book of Hebrews.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   For 13 chapters we've been talking about the excellencies of Christ,
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   supremacy of Christ over everything, and to don't take your eyes off of who Jesus is.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   But the point of that is not simply to save us from judgment.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   The point of it is to restore us into proper worship.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   Isaiah 43 verse 19, it says, "The people whom I formed for myself will declare my praise."
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   Over and over again, God says in deliverance of Israel,
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   in bondage, they're in anguish and they're crying out to God.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   And God raises up Moses and he sends Moses to Pharaoh,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   and he says this repeatedly over and over again,
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   "The reason why I am sending you, the reason why I'm demanding,
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   why Yahweh is demanding Pharaoh to let my people go," he says,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   "is so that they may worship me."
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   And he repeats that same phrase over and over again through Moses.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Exodus 7, 16, 8, 1, verse 20, chapter 9, verse 1, 13, chapter 10, verse 3, verse 7,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   chapter 28, verse 41, chapter 29, verse 1, over and over again,
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   the same phrase, "Let my people go so that they may worship me."
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   He didn't say, "Let my people go because they've suffered enough."
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   Because if you remember, once they got delivered and they were in the desert,
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   they experienced hunger that they didn't experience in Egypt,
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   even though they had a hard life, and they started grumbling and complaining.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   Oh, when we were there, at least we didn't have to worry about that.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   Even though our life was hard, we didn't have to worry about the people trying to kill us, these enemies.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   And when they got thirsty, they said, "Oh, yeah, we never ran out of water over there."
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   See, but God never said to them, "Let my people go so that they can drink.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   Let my people go so that they can eat."
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   He said, "Let my people go so that they may worship me."
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   So the primary reason why Israel was established and why Israel was delivered and chosen
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   was for the same reason why you and I have been chosen,
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   is so that we may worship Him.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   In fact, in every scene that we see in the Bible where we see the throne of God,
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   what you and I are going to see when we die and are in heaven,
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   is described in this way.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   Isaiah 6, 2, 3.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   Isaiah sees the throne of God and says, "Seraphim stood above Him,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   each having six wings, with two He covered their face,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   and with two He covered His feet, and with two He flew.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   And one called out to another and said, 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   The whole earth is full of His glory.'"
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   They were worshiping Him.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   That was the scene that they saw.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   In fact, every scene that we see of heaven, it's a scene of worship.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Revelation 7-11.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   "And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders of the four living creatures,
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshipped God."
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   Now, it was not forced. It was spontaneous.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   Because when they were in the presence of God's glory,
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   the natural response was they broke out in worship.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   The first response was fear and terror.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   But the second response from fear and terror is to worship God.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   See, when we are separated from God's glory,
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   what you and I are not able to do is to worship God.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   But because Jesus took away the barrier and He covered us with His blood,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   now we are able to be in the presence of this God and to see His glory and break out in worship.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   So the whole thing that He says, "Through Him."
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   The reason why Jesus did what He did was that through Him we could praise Him.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   Because praise is where we find our life, where we find the greatest joy.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   We end up worshiping whatever brings the greatest joy in our life.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   And it's not a burden.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   We look forward to it because that brings true life.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   So the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian is what he worships.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   I think some of you know that I'm not a fan of Disneyland.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   I don't know if I made that very clear. Let me make that very clear.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   So I'm not saying objectively that no one can go, that this is a place of sins, purgatory.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   I'm not saying that. It's like that for you.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   But it's like that for me.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   So when I think of Disneyland, I don't have happy thoughts.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   Endorphins don't kick in.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   I think of expensive churros, hot sun.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   I think of teenagers getting out of line, three-hour lines to ride a 15-second roller coaster.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   That's what I think of.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   And then you have to pay, what, $800 to get in now?
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   So when I think of Disneyland, those aren't happy thoughts.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   That's something that you do to please somebody else.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   But I know some of you guys don't feel that way.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   You guys go there, you spend your money, you spend all day hurting yourself in the sun,
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   emptying your pockets, eating $15 churros,
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   and then you come out and then you calculate, "When can I go again?"
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   I don't understand that because it doesn't bring joy.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   The thought of it gets me tired.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   But some of you fantasize about, "When's the next time I can go?"
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   Because that place brings happiness to you, right?
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   And you're willing to sacrifice, whatever it is that you're willing to go there,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   because it's a place that brings Zoe to you to some degree.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   See, the Bible says that true life is found in Christ.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   Jesus says, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   No one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   Through him, we're able to be restored into true life, where we find true joy.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   And when that joy is restored, we have true worship.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   And so that's what he means by he is pursuing people to restore them back
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   into the purpose in which God created us.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   See, the greatest benefit of our salvation is the new life that he has given us,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   so we're not tripped up in these trivial things.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   And that's our primary struggle, isn't it?
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   That sometimes we forget what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   And because we forget what it is that we have in Christ,
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   we let trivial things become the source of our joy.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   And when that seems to be threatened, we get anxious, and we worry,
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   and we compromise in order to have that.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   But the whole purpose of our salvation is to open the gate so that we can get to the God
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   that gives us true life.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   That's what he means, the whole purpose of all of Hebrews.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   In fact, the whole purpose of the whole Bible is to open the gate and to come in
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   so that we can experience this life.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   So worship is exactly what Jesus came to give us, restore to us.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   Number two, worship is not circumstantial, but it's continual.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   That's what it says in verse 15, "Let us continually offer up sacrifices of praise to God."
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   "That is the fruit of lips that give thanks to his name."
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   You know, in the Old Testament, God had major sacrifices in the book of Leviticus.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   You had the whole offering, you had the sin offering, peace offering, the guilt offering,
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   the grain offering.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   And so these are all offerings that God commanded the nation of Israel.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   You cannot approach God without the whole offering, the burnt offering,
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   because that offering represented atonement.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   Every time they approached God, they were reminded, "You are seasoned to be atoned for."
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   And all of this to point to the true atonement that was coming in Christ.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   But it was mandated.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   And then there were offerings that were freewill offerings.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   When things are happening, you're thankful to God and out of free gift.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   It was not mandated, but whenever certain things happened, maybe you had a great harvest
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   or God answered prayer for whatever the reason, you would voluntarily give your offering
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   and thank offering was part of that.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   So whenever they were overflowing in thankfulness, they would bring that to God voluntarily.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   But the thing is here, it's commanded.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   What was voluntary then, he said, it's commanded.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   In 1 Thessalonians 5, 16 to 18, he says, "Rejoice always."
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   How can he command us to rejoice always?
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   Does he not know that sometimes there's suffering in our lives?
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   Does he not know that I don't have a job and I don't know where the next paycheck is coming from?
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   Does he not know the relational problems that I'm having with my wife or husband or my children?
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   How can he tell us to rejoice always?
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   It almost seems like God's indifferent.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   Like he doesn't know our suffering.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   How can that be commanded?
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   Offer up, he says, to pray without ceasing and in everything give thanks.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   In everything.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   He doesn't qualify when you feel thankful.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   When things are going well, he says, in everything.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   Now, Apostle Paul is writing this church where people were being beaten for their faith.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   He actually had to get out of this city.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   I mean, you remember Apostle Paul? You remember who he is?
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   This is a guy who is in Lystra. He gets stoned, dragged out of the city.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   And then the only reason why they didn't kill him is because they thought he already died.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   This is a guy who was not afraid to die.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   He gets back up, gets back into Lystra and preaches the gospel.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   People are praying and prophets are telling him, "Don't go to Jerusalem because they're going to capture you there and you're going to be in prison."
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   He says, "Not only am I willing to go to prison, I'm willing to die."
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   So this is not a coward.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   Thessalonica is almost the only city that we know where Apostle Paul hurries up, packs up his bags and he leaves.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   And the reason why he leaves is because persecution was so intense.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   And it wasn't for himself. He was concerned for the Christians who converted there.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   To protect them, he leaves. That's how intense the persecution was here.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   And the whole reason why this letter was written is because he was concerned after he left that they would have destroyed them.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   That's the background behind 1 Thessalonians.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   And it is that letter, within that letter he says to rejoice always.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   To pray without ceasing. In everything give thanks.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   For this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   Think about all the things that we wrestle with about God's will.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   Is it God's will for me to marry this guy or this girl?
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   Is it God's will for me to go to this school or that school?
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   Is it God's will for me to have this business or that business?
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   And we're always seeking the Lord's will.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   We seek counseling. We read books. We hear sermons.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   What is the Lord's will?
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   Well, God didn't spell that out.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   He didn't spell out that these people are to be engineers, these people are to be businessmen, these people are to do this.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   He doesn't spell that out.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   He gives us the choice.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   Make a wise choice that honors and glorifies God.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   But here he says this is God's will.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   And he makes it crystal clear. What is God's will?
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   Our praise.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   Our rejoicing. Our thanksgiving. Constantly.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   Because it's not based on circumstance.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   In Philippians chapter 4, 6 it says be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   With thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   This is the go-to text whenever we're anxious.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   Whenever we get stuck, whenever we have problems, it's like be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   With thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   And the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   So if you've memorized this verse, you probably repeat that, meditate on this constantly.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   But you notice here where thanksgiving is mentioned?
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   Is it before or after you pray?
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   Because typically we would think thanksgiving happens as a result of answered prayer.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   Be anxious for nothing, right?
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   With everything by prayer and supplication let your requests be made known to God.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   And when God gives you the peace, make sure you give him thanks. He doesn't say that.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   He says approach him with what? Thanksgiving.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   Thanksgiving is before the prayer is answered.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   So our thanksgiving is not contingent upon answered prayer.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   He says to have the right heart to come before God with thanksgiving in your heart.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   So clearly thanksgiving is not circumstantial.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   Thanksgiving is not dependent upon what's happening around us.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   Luke chapter 10, 17 to 20, when he is sending out the 70 disciples and Jesus says this to them.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   The 70 returned with joy and saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name."
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   And he said to them, "I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions and over the power of the enemy,
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   and nothing will injure you."
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   Let me stop right there.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   Wouldn't you break out into praise if demons were subjected to you?
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   If given power, you can go out, get bit by scorpions, they're not going to hurt you.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   What?
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   But he qualifies that and said, "You're going to see powerful things.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   You're going to have power over these demonic, you're going to cast them out.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   You're going to see miracles."
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   But he qualifies this and said, "Nevertheless," verse 20, "do not rejoice in this,
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven."
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   It's not circumstantial.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   Despite all of that, rejoicing in everything, praising in everything,
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   because our peace, our joy, our praise is not based upon answered prayer in our circumstance.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   Happiness is not having what you want.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.000]   Happiness is wanting what you have.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   It was on some clock in my house.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   I didn't quote the Bible.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   I think it's biblical, though.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   Happiness is not wanting what you have, but having what you want.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   See, as Christians, he said, "Our joy and our praise does not change because of circumstance."
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   Because the Bible says that everything that we need for a life of godliness
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   has been given to us in the knowledge of his son, Jesus Christ.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   So the peace that he gave us, he said, is a peace that the world cannot give you.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   And it's a peace that the world cannot take from you.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   So therefore, our rejoicing, our thanksgiving is based upon our eternal security that we have in him.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   He says, "Don't rejoice because of the temporary things that you see.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   Rejoice that your name is written in heaven in eternity."
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   So whether good or bad, when we have faith in God, we always have reason to praise.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   We always have reason to be thankful.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   You know, after the sermon, we're going to sing this song, "Blessed Be Your Name."
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   You guys probably know this song, but the song goes like this,
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   "Blessed be your name in the land that is plentiful.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   When your streams of abundance flow, blessed be your name."
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   That first line isn't uniquely Christian.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   Even rappers who have vile lyrics, when they come and get their award, they say, "Thank the Lord."
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   When people win lottery, even atheists thank God.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   Movie stars, thank God for this blessing.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   That's not uniquely Christian.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   What's uniquely Christian is the second verse.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   "Blessed be your name when I am found in the desert place, though I walk through the wilderness.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   Blessed be your name."
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   Verse 4, "Blessed be your name on the road marked with suffering.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   There's pain in the offering.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   Blessed be your name."
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   Sometimes having a lot of things become a hindrance to true joy.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   True joy, we believe and we know that it's found in Christ.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   There's a reason why Jesus said it's hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   It's easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   Because of the distraction, because of the temptation.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   Because we naturally think that if I had that, if my circumstance changed, if my relationship,
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   if something changed, if my health was better, it would be so much better.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   I'd be so much happier.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   And that becomes a distraction to really seeing the true joy that we have in Christ.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   I remember when I was back in college, I had this janitorial job and I would work from 5 to 1.30, 2 in the morning.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   And I remember one day I was coming out and I was driving home near Biola.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   This is where it happened.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   And I was driving home and I ran through a red light.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   It was 2 in the morning, I was just tired.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   And there were three cars on the road, 2 in the morning.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   My car, the car I hit, and the cop behind her.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   And so we're there exchanging phone numbers and all this stuff.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   And I did have insurance through my parents.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   But I was 19 years old.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   So they weren't satisfied with whatever settlement that they got.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   And so they started coming after my parents, but they realized that I wasn't 18, I was 19.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   So they couldn't go after them.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   So they started coming after me.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   For three years.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   And every few months I would get a letter from the lawyer.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   You know, this is what's going on, this is what's happening.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   And then at the end they sent me a final letter saying that the court demands that you list all your assets.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   Because they're trying to sue me.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   Well, I had $50 in the bank account.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   And then I remember having this conversation with my roommates, because they were all about 10 to 11 years older than I was.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   And I was asking them for advice.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   Because the only thing I have is the $50 in my bank account.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   And I had this guitar that I was given as a gift.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   And my guess is it was worth about $100.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   It's like, do I need to put this on here?
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   And they said, I don't know.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   So I put guitar and $50.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   And I mailed it, put a stamp on it, and I sent it back.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   And then the next letter that I got basically in summary in modern translation was forget it.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   It's not worth it.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   She probably regretted it for three years of pursuing me.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   I think she was waiting for me to graduate college and make some money.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   And she didn't realize where I was.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   I share this story because it was so satisfying to not worry about losing anything.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   In fact, right around that time, I was driving a Hyundai XL.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   It didn't belong to me. It belonged to my parents.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   And I was driving it, and I was coming out of this parking lot.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   And you know one of those light poles in the parking lot?
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   And it had a huge cement block to hold it?
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   So if you're too close to it, you don't see the cement block.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   So I was there, and I was driving out of the parking lot, and I didn't even see it.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   So I was revving to get out, and I smashed my car into that.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   And it wasn't a slight dent. It was in the middle of the car, and I hit it hard.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   And oh my gosh, what was that?
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   I came out, and the car was dented in, and I couldn't even drive it
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   because the whole frame got bent in the middle.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   So I had to call the tow truck, took it to the garage, and they said, "Man, what did you do?"
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   It's like a bad accident.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   I said, "What happened?" I hit a pole.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   Like by yourself? Yeah, by myself, I hit the pole.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   So basically they said, "In order to fix this, we need to get a machine
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   and pull the body back out and get it in the frame."
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   This is Hyundai Accel, brand new. It was probably like $4,500.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   And they were saying it's going to cost $2,000, $3,000 to fix all this.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   So basically the car got jumped.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   And I remember coming home from that, my roommates picking me up,
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   thinking like, "Man, now I really have nothing."
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   Right? "What am I going to do? How am I going to get by? I don't have a car."
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   And so that was my first thought of anxiousness, of what am I going to do.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   And then, weirdly, there was a sense of peace.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000]   Like now I have nothing holding me back.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   I literally have nothing in my name.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   And for some reason, initially it brought anxiousness, but I was happy.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   People would think I'm crazy that I'm thinking that,
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   but I just remember, and even I couldn't understand it.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   Like, "Why are you happy?"
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   Because I had nothing. I mean, the thought of having nothing was very freeing.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   I share this story because I remember at that time thinking
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   that all the pursuits that we give so much attention to
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   is such a great hindrance, oftentimes.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   And we pursue it because we think that that's going to make us happy.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   That if we have that, a bigger house, a nicer car, a better job, better retirement,
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   and we pursue that because we think that if we had that, if we visited this,
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   if we ate that, that that's going to cause happiness.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   But the very thing that we think is going to cause happiness
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   is a source of frustration in our life.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   And so I remember at that moment just having nothing, just being free.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   And I could literally come before God and say, "Here am I. Send me."
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   I could have an earthquake hit and have the house burn down,
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   and all I have to do is pick up my sleeping bag and go somewhere else.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   And that thought just was freeing.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   See, our joy and our praise is not based on circumstance.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   It's not based on friendship. It's not based upon community or health,
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   but what we have that the world cannot take away.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   Thirdly, worship involves more than what we do on Sunday.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   In Hebrews 13, verse 16, it says, "Do not neglect doing good and sharing."
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   So worship is more than just singing. Worship is more than just putting in our time.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   But our actual act itself is an act of worship.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   The word "litruo" in our Bibles are translated oftentimes as "worship."
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   There's three prominent words in the Greek that's translated "worship."
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   The first word is "proskeneo." "Proskeneo" is to be prostrated before God,
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   to be bent over in worship.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   So most of the time you see the word "worship" in the New Testament,
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   it's that word "proskeneo."
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   The second word is "sabomai." "Sabomai" means a sense of reverence and respect.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   So it's what's happening internally.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   The third word is "litruo." "Litruo" oftentimes in your Bible is translated "serve."
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   And sometimes in your translation it'll be translated as "worship,"
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   and that's exactly what that word means.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   "Litruo" means the actual physical act of carrying out something as an act of worship.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   So sometimes that word is described when priests are in the temple,
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   at least in the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament,
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   where they are performing these acts as an act of worship.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   Sometimes in the New Testament it's translated as an act of giving, serving, living in obedience.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   In Romans 12, verse 1, it says, "Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God,
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God,
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   which is your spiritual service of litruo."
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   Spiritual service of litruo.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   So worship is not simply just what we do here, singing, listening, attending.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   Everything we do can be an act of worship.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   I think the struggle that we get into is when we are doing things simply out of obligation,
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   Jesus and God becomes a taskmaster because we want to be serious Christians.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   We want to be good Christians.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   And so what do good Christians do?
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   They read their Bible.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   They pray.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   They give.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   They serve.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   But you ever notice that the people who are the most bitter and angry after a while
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   are the people at one point who used to serve the most?
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   At one point in their lives?
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   They gave.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   They served.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   They sacrificed.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   They made disciples.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   They prayed.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   And at the end of that, it turns into bitterness.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   Like, how come nobody is helping me?
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   And they don't -- they didn't get the praise or whatever it was that they were looking for.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   They didn't get it.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   And then they become bitter and angry.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   So the people who served the most, gave the most, end up becoming the most antagonistic
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   for the very thing that they pursued.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   What God wants is not simply our service.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   What God wants from us is worship.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   And so when we do things out of worship, it produces greater joy.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   Just like Disneyland.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   And I think of that.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   If I go to Disneyland, right, because somebody made me, that's torture.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   Right?
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   That's eight hours.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   And I paid for this.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   Standing in the sun, my knees swelling up, surrounded by kids cursing.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   I mean, I could give you a list in my head.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   And at the end of that, I don't come out singing and dancing.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   I come out, never again.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   And somebody, can you do it again?
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   Oh, my God, again?
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   I got to do this again?
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   See, that's religion.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   That's when somebody is trying so hard to appease a taskmaster and realizing that you can't ever really appease him.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   And so you're constantly living and serving out of guilt, out of accountability, in order to belong.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   So the reward isn't Christ.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   Reward is belonging here.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   Reward is praise from other people.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   But eventually, it's not enough.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   And that's exactly what was happening with Mary.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   It wasn't that she was serving, but the serving led to grumbling.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   I mean, Marys are great.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   Marys are the ones who keep the church going.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   Marys are the ones who are staying late and show up early to clean up the church.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   But the problem with Mary wasn't that she was serving, but that her serving led to the grumbling.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   Sorry, Martha.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   I used the wrong name.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   Mary is the good one.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   You guys are all staring at me like, "Were you in the same Bible?"
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   I meant Martha, Martha.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   Even in our worship, even in our service, God wants us to do it out of act of worship.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   You notice when new Christians come in and they're just happy to be here?
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   They're happy to come to church.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   They're happy to sing.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   They're happy to serve.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   And at the end of all their service, they ask, "Oh, anything else that you need?"
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   Versus people who have been weighed down by sacrifice.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   They've been working so hard, sacrificing so much more than anybody else.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   Their constant state is grumbling.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   Worship is not taking place.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   The call for Christians is to make other worshipers.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   Not people who are more disciplined, not people who simply read the Bible more, more organized,
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   and work harder, and sacrifice more, and love people that you can't love,
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   and I'm going to be a really good Christian.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   No, what he is pursuing are other worshipers.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   In Psalm 23, verse 5, it says, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   You have anointed my head with oil.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   My cup overflows."
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   You ever put too much coffee or whatever in your cup, you know what I mean,
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   and it's too hot and you can't drink it, so you got to move it from wherever it is to another place?
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   What usually happens?
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   It overflows, right?
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   And if somebody else has that, you don't want to be near them because you know you're going to get splashed.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   So you kind of walk gingerly, try to keep it in the cup, but it always ends up overflowing, right?
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   That's how our praise is described.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   It overflows. My cup overflows.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   You know the best way to evangelize is to have our cup overflow, to have our cup overflow.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   Who would want to hear the gospel from somebody who's like, "Hey, you could be a Christian too,
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   so you can come to church and sacrifice and get up early in the morning and serve people you don't want to serve.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   Love people that you hate, but then come to church and love them anyway."
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   Do you want Christ?
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   Who would want to join that?
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   That's not what he called us to do.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   He said, "We've fallen short of the glory of the gospel of Jesus, glory of God."
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   And then he says that, "The God of the saints has blinded the mind of the unbelievers
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   so that they do not see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ."
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   So the whole point of the preaching of the gospel is that through what Christ has done,
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   through the preaching, through the sharing of the gospel, that their eyes may see what?
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   Their sin? Yes.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   But why do they need to see their sin?
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   So that they can be cleansed of their sin, so that what?
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   They can see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, so they can see his glory.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   So if all the gospel is, is God's going to get rid of your sin.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   That's not attractive.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   Yeah, we're not going to go to hell, but that's not the point of salvation.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   The point of salvation is to come to Christ.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   That you too may be able to see the glory of who he is.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   That you too may worship.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   And so the best way to make disciples of other people worshiping is to have our cup overflow.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:55.000]   When our cup overflows, other people will catch that.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   Evangelism has to come as an overflowing of our heart of who God is.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   That this is not something that we do because you're supposed to do it.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   Like miserable people trying to make other miserable people.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   No. He said he came to give life and to give this life abundantly.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   The joy that he gave me, the worship, praise, peace that he gave me, that you also can have.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   Fourth and finally, worship pleases God.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   In our generation, I've been hearing through the grapevine, through articles and different people saying that
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   in order to bring more people to church and ease whatever guilt and shame that people may have,
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   I've been hearing, it's like there's no way you can please God.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   Only Jesus can please God.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   So there's nothing you do.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   So you don't need to feel guilty because God loves you just the way you are.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   But the problem with that is that may apply in justification, but when it comes to sanctification,
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   the scripture is very clear. God can be pleased and frustrated with us.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   Have you not read about the letters that is written in the book of Revelation?
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   It's filled with things that God is pleased with, things that God is not pleased with.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   So yes, we can displease God, grieve the Holy Spirit, and we can also please God.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   Here it says our worship, a life of worship, pleases God.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   It pleases Him.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   In Hebrews 12, verse 2, it says, "Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith,
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   who for the joy set before Him endured the cross."
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   Now what joy was He pursuing?
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   What joy was worth His sacrifice and His suffering?
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   His glory? Well, He said He gave up glory.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   Even though in every way He was equal with God, considering equality with God something not to be grasped,
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   but He emptied Himself, became nothing.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   So what is it that He was pursuing?
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000]   What is it that He had after the cross that He didn't have before the cross,
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   and it was that joy that He was pursuing?
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   Me and you. Me and you.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   Our worship was the joy that He was pursuing.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   Our worship, our joy, our life is what He was pursuing.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   That's why it says, "He endured the cross, despising the shame,
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   He sacrificed Himself in order to pursue His joy,
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   so that you and I may have this joy.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   Spurgeon says this about this subject.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   "Dear brothers and sisters, be sure that you do not lose your joy.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   If you ever lose the joy of religion, you will lose the power of religion."
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   Let me say that again.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   "If you ever lose the joy of religion, you will lose the power of religion.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   Do not be satisfied to be a miserable believer.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   An unhappy believer is a poor creature,
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000]   but he who is resigned to being so is in dangerous condition.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   Depend upon it.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000]   Greater importance attaches to holy happiness than most people think.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   As you are happy in the Lord, you will be able to praise His name.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   Rejoice in the Lord, that you may praise Him."
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   You notice here rejoicing and praise are intertwined?
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   When we are rejoicing, when we recognize what it is that we have in Christ,
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   that leads into genuine praise.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   John 17, 13, Jesus says,
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   "But now I have come to you, and these things I speak in the world,
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:41.000]   so that they may have My joy made full in themselves."
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   He wanted us to have the joy that He has because of where He is.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   He wanted us to bring us to Him so that we may experience that joy.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]   Isaiah 62, verse 5, it says,
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   "For as young man marries a virgin, so your sons will marry you.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so your God will rejoice over you."
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   Our God rejoices over us.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000]   So many people live their lives thinking He's a taskmaster,
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   watching to see if we're going to do the right thing.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:18.000]   And yet the way that He describes our relationship is He rejoices over us.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   It gives Him joy.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:26.000]   He pursued the cross and the shame, ultimately to pursue joy,
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:32.000]   to see us come and rejoicing and experience this life that He wants us to have.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000]   So the primary thing that He's looking for,
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   the primary thing that He rejoices over is our praise, our worship.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:48.000]   If you've ever loved something so much that their happiness brings the greatest joy to you,
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000]   you know exactly what we're talking about.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.000]   If you're a parent and you raise children, you know what we're talking about.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   You don't have to be a parent.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:03.000]   If you love your wife or your husband, just seeing them happy makes you happy.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000]   Parents, or maybe your friends, maybe a co-worker,
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000]   or maybe you're leading Bible study and you've committed yourself to certain people,
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   just seeing the joy that you brought to them gives you the greatest joy.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   Let me wrap up in this.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   I started with Disneyland, so let me end with Disneyland.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000]   I don't know if I made it clear.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   I'm not a fan of Disneyland.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.000]   But I do have one very fond memory of Disneyland.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   And I'm going to mention my nephew, Nathan.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000]   This was before all the rest of us had kids.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.000]   And so Nathan was--I forget how old he was, but he was enough where he could run,
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000]   but he wasn't able to articulate.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   But I remember we all decided to go to Disneyland.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000]   And obviously I'm not a fan of Disneyland.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:59.000]   But we went because of Nathan.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   Actually, all of us went.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   And so if you remember--if you know where Disneyland is, if you go into the gate,
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   there's that outer part before you go to the tunnel where you suffer afterwards,
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000]   you go into that tunnel, right?
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   But before the suffering happens, there's that one little place where they have the flowers,
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   you take the pictures, and they have a shop there.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000]   So we all got there, and we're all waiting for people to come.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   And then so we get into that place, and we're all standing on the side,
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   and I'm gearing up for a long day of suffering.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   Well, Nathan kind of comes in.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   He pops out of his chair, and he just started running back and forth,
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   just happy to be in Disneyland because he realized where he was,
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.000]   and once he realized that, he just like, "Ahh!"
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000]   And literally, I mean, he was just back and forth.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:00.000]   I can't imagine another human being being that happy about anything, right?
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   More happy than if your favorite team won the championship.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000]   I mean, at that age, I mean, he was just, "Yeah!"
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000]   He was back and forth, back and forth.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:14.000]   And I remember all of us just kind of like gearing up for this long day.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   All of us was filled with laughter.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   Just see him so happy that he was there.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:30.000]   So that whole day was saved just from that.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   Endorphins kicked in, and it wasn't because I was looking forward to what was in there.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   It was seeing that just pure joy from that child at that age.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:47.000]   All of a sudden, without a single word being spoken, I was worth that day.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:54.000]   I share that with you because that's how the Bible describes our salvation.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:02.000]   That we've tasted the goodness of God, and we're eagerly waiting to get into that gate.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:09.000]   That once we get in, that any bit of joy and happiness and praise and thanksgiving
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:16.000]   that we may have experienced here, the Bible says we've only experienced it in part.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   We're like children.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   We kind of imagine, but when Christ comes in his glory, we will be glorified with him,
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:33.000]   and we will be in eternity celebrating and praising forever.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000]   That's salvation.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   That's why Christ came.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000]   That's why we worship.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000]   That's why we pray.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   That's why we study the Bible.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   So as we focus this year in saying hope and pray, that prayer does not become another
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:56.000]   task, another discipline, but it was an avenue for us to express our thanksgiving to him,
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:03.000]   to commune with the only being that can give us that peace and joy.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:11.000]   And all the distractions of our lives, that we would learn to see it as it really is, temporary,
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:16.000]   to focus our eyes upon Christ, author and perfecter of our faith.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   Let's pray.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for loving us.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000]   We thank you for saving us.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   I pray that our testimony would be the same, that our cups truly would overflow, that you
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:47.000]   would sanctify us, that we would learn more and more each week what it means to be worshipers
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   who worship you in spirit and in truth.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:56.000]   Help us, Lord God, to know this joy, that it may overflow in thanksgiving and praise.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000]   May Christ's name be exalted.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   Amen.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000]   Why don't we all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:13.000]   [Pause]
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:20.000]   [Music]
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000]   Blessed be your name.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   Blessed be your name.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   The land that is plentiful.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.000]   Where streams of abundance flow.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.000]   Blessed be your name.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000]   Blessed be your name.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000]   When I'm found in the desert place.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000]   Though I walk through the wilderness.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:54.000]   Blessed be your name.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:02.000]   Every blessing you pour out, I'll turn back to praise.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:08.000]   When the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000]   Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   Blessed be your name.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000]   Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:26.000]   Blessed be your glorious name.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000]   Blessed be your name.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.000]   When the sun's shining down on me.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000]   When the world's all as it should be.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:42.000]   Blessed be your name.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   Blessed be your name.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:49.000]   On the road marked with suffering.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   There's pain in the offering.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:58.000]   Blessed be your name.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   Every blessing you pour out, I'll turn back to praise.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:12.000]   When the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000]   Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.000]   Blessed be your name.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000]   Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000]   Blessed be your glorious name.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:33.000]   You give and take away.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000]   You give and take away.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:46.000]   My heart will choose to say, blessed be your name.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000]   Every blessing.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:56.000]   Every blessing you pour out, I'll turn back to praise.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:02.000]   When the darkness closes in, Lord, still I will say.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000]   Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.000]   Blessed be your name.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.000]   Blessed be your glorious name.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000]   Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000]   Blessed be your name.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000]   Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000]   Blessed be your glorious name.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:39.000]   You give and take away.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.000]   You give and take away.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:50.000]   My heart will choose to say, blessed be your name.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:58.000]   Let's pray.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000]   Psalm 73, 25 through 28.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000]   Whom have I in heaven but you?
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000]   And besides you, I desire nothing on earth.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000]   My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000]   heart and my portion forever.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000]   For behold, those who are far from you will perish.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000]   You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you, but ask
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000]   for me.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000]   The nearness of God is my good.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000]   I have made the Lord God my refuge, that I may tell of all
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000]   your works.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000]   Lord, we pray that this would be our confession this week.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000]   That you would be our refuge, you would be our comfort, you
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000]   would be our joy, and that we would worship you, spirit and
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000]   in truth, whether here or wherever it is that we send
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000]   -- you send us.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000]   That truly, Father God, whether we eat or drink, that it may be
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000]   done for your glory.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000]   Amen.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:56.000]   God sent his son.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:02.000]   They called him Jesus.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:10.000]   He came to the poor land for the poor.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:16.000]   He lived and died.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.000]   To buy my pardon.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:28.000]   An empty grave is there to fill.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000]   My Savior lives.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:43.000]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:54.000]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:05.000]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:16.000]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000]   Amen.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000]   Amen.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:30.000]   [music]
