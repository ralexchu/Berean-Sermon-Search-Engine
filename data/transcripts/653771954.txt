[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040]   - Good morning, church family.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.920]   My name is Mary Kim, and I'm a third-year student at UCI,
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.760]   and this is my testimony.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.320]   I was born into a Christian family and grew up going to church.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.840]   From an early age, I witnessed my mom's unwavering faith in God
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.400]   as she raised our family, and later witnessed my two older brothers
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.240]   accept Christ in their early teenage years.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.600]   With a lack of personal faith and conviction, I grew up believing that
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.000]   I was Christian because I never disagreed with what I was taught,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.720]   and I desired to be seen as an obedient, good child in the church.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.100]   I trusted that Christianity was true and right because I trusted
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.840]   in my family's judgment.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.920]   For most of my life, my faith came secondhand.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.080]   Having the right answers in Bible study and knowing how to talk about God
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.040]   were easy, but loving others and applying what I learned out of a genuine
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.280]   love for God was frustratingly difficult.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.480]   I felt that God was a distant being that was always unsatisfied with how I failed
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.640]   to prioritize and love him enough.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.200]   I thought that everyone read the Bible and spent time in prayer out of dedication
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.680]   and diligence and not out of a true desire to do so.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.080]   Without knowing the gospel, I tried to produce good fruit on my own,
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.720]   striving to achieve righteousness through my own willpower and wisdom.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.600]   There came a point in early high school when I was faced with a mountain
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.400]   of burnout and doubt.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.000]   When I compared my faith with that of my mom and brothers,
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.280]   there was a stark lack of genuinity and love.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.880]   My heart hardened over time with pride from my self-perceived maturity
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.840]   and holiness, along with the unsettling fear of facing the potential illegitimate
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.960]   status of my faith and God himself.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.920]   I learned to push thoughts of God and everything to do with him to the back
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.440]   of my mind in an act of self-preservation.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.160]   I didn't want to think about whether my family's faith was foolish or whether
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.560]   I wasn't one of God's elect.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.280]   I felt helpless because I thought I had tried my hardest to please God and do
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.440]   what was right.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.120]   But in reality, I saw God as someone I had to please so that he would do what I
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.760]   wanted and didn't understand my own sinfulness and depravity.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.680]   Our family began tuning in to Berean Sunday service live streams in August 2020.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.600]   Pastor Peter's expository messages and adherence to the word struck me deeply.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.440]   After growing up in a church that preached topically and often implicitly preached
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.280]   the gospel, I was shaken by the clarity of truth and boldness with which he
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.960]   faithfully preached.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.680]   I felt for the first time that I could get somewhere in my faith by staying at
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.960]   Berean and absorbing the biblical truths that I didn't realize I was hungry for.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.320]   However, halfway into membership classes, I was asked to submit my testimony.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.000]   I talked with Pastor Nate, sharing my disheartening experience of striving to
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.960]   be a good Christian, but not even knowing who God is to me personally.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.040]   I wasn't sure what to make of my life of bitterness and lack of transformation,
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.280]   along with my newfound passion of learning more about God through his word
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.160]   at Berean.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.720]   At the end of our conversation, it was clear that I was not saved as there was
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.120]   never a moment of true repentance in my life.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.400]   Over the next few months, I met regularly with a Berean sister in my class named
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.240]   Danielle Choi, and she walked me through the gospel.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.200]   God revealed to me how I never knew him and lived for him as I reflected on what
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.040]   I lived for.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.720]   It wasn't a matter of not giving up enough of my life to God.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.960]   He showed me that all of my intentions were for my own glory, satisfaction, and
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.960]   kingdom.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.560]   He showed me how my heart rebelled against him as I idolized myself, my
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.160]   relationships, and material things.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.240]   I reflected on the vanity and folly of chasing after things of the world, of
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.760]   living for myself in worship of my broken self.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.480]   After sharing with Danielle that I was questioning the way I've been living my
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.880]   life for the first time, she asked me what I thought I needed saving from.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.760]   In love, she firmly reminded me that coming to salvation is not a matter of
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.440]   choosing between life as a better fulfilled person or life as a worse flawed
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.880]   person.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.400]   Someone's faith or lack of faith results in eternal consequences of life or
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.660]   death set by an eternal and holy God.
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.640]   God showed me how far I had fallen from him and his holiness and in my helpless
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:25.200]   state as I understood my personal identity as a sinner.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.980]   He opened my eyes to my sin and absolute need for salvation.
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.100]   I repented of my sin knowing that Jesus is the only one who could and did take
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.220]   my sins, die for me, and grant me righteousness and freedom.
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.100]   For the first time, God broke my heart over my sin, compelling me to turn away
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.940]   from inherent dirtiness and rebellion against him.
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.760]   He was already offering me the completed work of salvation if I would place my
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.340]   faith in him.
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.440]   John 5, 24 says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.500]   in him who has sent me has eternal life and does not come into judgment but has
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.620]   passed out of death into life."
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.420]   I placed my faith in Jesus in late August 2021, trusting that it is only by
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.020]   God's grace through faith I can be saved.
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.460]   I am living life ever in awe of the love and grace that God has shown me as I look
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.620]   at what Jesus has done on the cross.
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.260]   Romans 5, 8 says, "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this.
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.100]   While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.220]   There was nothing I could offer God, nothing I could do to redeem myself,
[00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.540]   nothing good or valuable in me, and yet he sent his son to die for me so that he
[00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.980]   would adopt me into his kingdom."
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.500]   I am learning more about God's character and works as I read his word and pray.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.900]   I'm growing in praise and thanksgiving as he reveals his truth and continuously
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.060]   proves his faithfulness to me.
[00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.980]   God is humbling me as he enlightens my weaknesses and need for him.
[00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.420]   I want to live my life in full submission to God, being sanctified and molded into
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.740]   his likeness by the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.500]   Galatians 2, 20 says, "I have been crucified with Christ and it is no longer I
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.700]   who live, but Christ lives in me.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.180]   And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the son of God
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.660]   who loved me and gave himself up for me."
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.700]   Thank you.

[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:51.700]   [ Pause ]
