[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640]   All right, let's take our Bibles over to John chapter 11 and I just wanted to
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.760]   give a little bit of a background about this passage. The Gospel of John is very
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.440]   interesting because it's not a short gospel but the events that are recorded
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.520]   is pretty brief. Chapters 1 through 11 is essentially the ministry of Christ and
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.400]   in chapter 12 on to the end of the book is literally just the last few weeks
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.720]   leading up to Christ's crucifixion. And so I'm asking you to turn to chapter 11
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.640]   and that is going to be a like a tipping point. It's a pivotal transition in the
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.320]   Gospel of John. Chapter 11 contains the last and perhaps the greatest of the
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.880]   miracles that Jesus is going to perform and his works are going to testify of
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.280]   who he is and he's going to teach his disciples but namely Mary, Martha, and the
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.840]   family are going to be taught an invaluable lesson. Now I'm just going to
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.680]   give you a preface a little bit. This sermon is way longer than I thought it
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.400]   would be. I originally slotted out six verses to study and preach but now I'm
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.040]   going to be doing 45 verses. Okay, I just wanted to give you a heads up. Okay, let's
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.760]   pray about that. Let's pray for God to bless the time of our study in the Word.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.600]   Let's take a moment to bow. Father God we want to thank you for your truth. I pray
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.920]   God that as as we approach your Word help us to approach it with gratitude
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.840]   that you are revealing truth to us. Help us to have humble hearts, accepting
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.640]   hearts of what you have and also God would you continue just to cause our
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.160]   minds to be renewed and that deep inside if there is any anything that keeps us
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.920]   from you that those would be both exposed and dealt with by your grace. God
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.480]   we also pray for your blessing upon the India team. We pray for every single
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.560]   member. God that their minds and hearts would be eager to serve the Lord, to
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.560]   serve the people, to love on strangers and those who are different and God just
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.320]   to have an eternal perspective that what they are doing though it be short,
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.200]   although it be just a few weeks, God they have eternal consequences. Father we
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   thank you it's in Christ's name. Amen. Okay, when I think about this chapter I
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.920]   think about movies because it's a pretty dramatic story and I felt the need to
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.000]   walk through the whole story with you. I don't watch a whole bunch of movies but
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.200]   I do like once in a while looking up these movie trailers because the movie
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   trailers you kind of get a gist of what the whole entire movie is about anyway
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.440]   right? But sometimes you know almost as a joke and whatnot there are these
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.320]   outlandish movie reviews where it's like this movie has everything. It'll make you
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.120]   laugh. It'll make you cry. It'll make you you know all this kind of stuff and it
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.120]   promises so much you know. Suspense so riveting and I'm trying to do my best
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.400]   voice with that guy but it kind of gives you this hype of like what the movie is
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.600]   all gonna be about and then you and you watch the movie and you're like oh my
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.760]   gosh this is so boring. Well the thing about it is if I could give a review of
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.600]   this chapter just chapter 11 of John I would give you that kind of review. This
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.000]   chapter it's gonna make you laugh because there's some comedy. It's gonna
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.400]   make you cry because it's moving and there's death. The suspense is truly is
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.760]   captivating. The drama oh there's a lot of drama okay. It has it all but most of
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.720]   all sometimes a good movie just hits you and where your emotions are as they say
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.480]   it these days like it hits you in the feels you know. It makes you just I don't
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.560]   know come out with feeling like the story really captivated everything about
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.440]   you and moves you along and this chapter does that for me and I wanted I wanted to
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.320]   preach on this. Mainly though aside from the suspense and the laughter and all
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.760]   that stuff surprisingly this chapter that talks about the death of Lazarus
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.880]   was probably one of the most profound stories that taught me that God loves us
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.600]   and it struck me so deep I just as I was studying that small section I wanted to
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.280]   preach I read the chapter and I just had to stop and so I want to give you this
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.240]   introduction to say look for the Lord's love throughout this story. Let's jump in
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.160]   starting from verse 1 and it says now a certain man was sick Lazarus of Bethany
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.560]   the village of Mary and her sister Martha it was the Mary who anointed the
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.080]   Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:58.240]   sick so the sisters sent word to him saying Lord behold he whom you love is
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.640]   sick but when Jesus heard this he said this sickness is not to end in death but
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.920]   for the glory of God so that the Son of God may be glorified by it. Now Jesus
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.040]   loved Martha and her sister Lazarus sorry and her sister and Lazarus so when
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.040]   he heard that he was sick he then stayed two days longer in the place where he
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.360]   was. If I were directing this movie this is the beginning crisis you know a lot
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.440]   of times the movie is open with just a man like running through the wilderness
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.080]   and you're like what's going on and it looks like he's almost running for his
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.680]   life and he's just panting and he finally gets to this city where Jesus
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.560]   and his disciples are I found you there's anxiety in his eyes you know and
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.760]   there's like his heart is pumping he can barely get it out and this brother you
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:55.400]   love Lazarus he's dying you know it's the suspense of the opening scene it's
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.840]   the crisis that lends for the development of the story and within it
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.120]   you see Jesus respond with this great grand a response of what God is going to
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:15.200]   do this scenario Lazarus is not gonna die but he's gonna live and God will be
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.800]   glorified you know it's kind of like the you know when you see these movies of
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.360]   grand epic venture something huge is gonna happen the Lord is gonna be
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.000]   glorified by this and there's a question how right what's he gonna do
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.160]   what's Jesus gonna do in this story and then Jesus goes I'm gonna sit down
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.600]   it's just confusing like the disconnect and what's going on and I could just
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.360]   probably imagine the face of the man who was the messenger who just ran and I
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.800]   believe he probably journeyed a day or two because if you look at the storyline
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.680]   of it the man is sent while Lazarus is sick and then he comes and tells Jesus
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.480]   Jesus waits two days and then when Jesus finally arrives on the scene it says
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.280]   that Lazarus has been in the grave four days that means tribal time is very long
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.440]   so he's out of breath he's like you gotta come Mary I'm Arthur calling and
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.520]   laughs is gonna die he's mortally wounded or something he's sick you know
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.280]   and then Jesus like yes I love him and God's gonna be glorified let's wait
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.320]   what and I'm thinking it'd be a very awkward moment for the messenger I say
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:31.000]   do I stay with you what do I do do I go back you know and then he's just sitting
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.280]   there like what do I do what do I do and so there's a moment of confusion
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.400]   there's a moment of disconnect and if in that there's a lot of things going on
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:45.160]   but what you see is this what you see is first the introduction in the crisis of
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.120]   the huge elements that are going to be in the story number one Jesus loves
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:56.800]   Lazarus Lazarus the love of God is there the love of Christ is there but in this
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.760]   entire story what's gonna come about as a result is Christ and God will be
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:09.680]   glorified in one right but then you see confusingly the suffering of the people
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:16.160]   okay there's three things love the glory the suffering and it teaches us from the
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.840]   very beginning although it's just the crisis setup it teaches us a lot now
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:29.080]   what is most glorifying to God often comes painfully to us Mary and Martha
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.000]   are going to be in grief they're gonna be in disappointment and we're gonna see
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.680]   their character develop later right the disciples they're gonna be put out in a
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.720]   situation where they're gonna whether go or not or what are they gonna do and
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.480]   the typically what we think is in our best interest typically what we think
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:53.080]   should happen sometimes and actually many times is not what is most glorifying
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.840]   to God and Christ says at the very beginning of this crisis although the
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.240]   people are thinking easy solution you come do your thing do the miracle and
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.920]   Christ says I'm gonna wait but you know what's very interesting about all this
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:11.480]   it's gonna all come together because what you see is in the verse it says
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:19.240]   that now Jesus loved Martha and his sister and Lazarus so therefore from the
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:26.360]   love therefore he waited all that's gonna start working together so let's
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.960]   see the development of the story and I'm gonna call the next section the suspense
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:37.000]   builds the suspense builds I know for those you guys taking notes doing a huge
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.400]   section is gonna be hard to follow along but I'm gonna try to break it up into
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:46.080]   pieces and move along a plot line okay so the suspense is building suspense is
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.320]   building let's continue in the story in verse 7 then after he after this after
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.320]   he waited right after this question of like what are you doing what's gonna
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:01.800]   happen what's what's gonna be glorious right he says now said to the disciples
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:07.480]   let us go to Judea again but the disciples they said to him rabbi the
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:13.200]   Jews were just about now to seeking to stone you and are you going there again
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:19.840]   in chapter 10 what happened was the Jews accused Jesus of blasphemy and they
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:25.440]   picked up stones literally to put him to death then and there but Jesus you know
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.600]   it exited and then he came out of Jerusalem right and so then the
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.080]   disciples mind they're just thinking like are you crazy we're not going back
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.360]   there and not only that they know what Jesus can do they know what Jesus is
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:43.920]   capable of capable of they've seen Jesus say a word to the centurion and it's the
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.720]   centurion servant be healed right just say the word Jesus let's do distance
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.800]   healing you don't even need to go in the city just do the sniper thing from afar
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.200]   you don't have to go in there and you can just imagine the the disciples
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.360]   thinking about this I'm pretty sure one of the disciples they just waited two
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.880]   days that means they went to bed they ate he's just doing his thing and Jesus
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:11.240]   is like hey let's go I could just imagine the story of the some of these
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:17.600]   disciples thinking like that couldn't we just do this from before and then Jesus
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:23.320]   answers in verse 9 are there not 12 hours in the day if anyone walks in the
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.040]   day he does not stumble because he sees the light of the world but if anyone
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.880]   walks in the night he stumbles because the light is not in him what Jesus is
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:37.200]   saying is very simple are there not 12 hours in the day and you're like no
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.720]   there's 24 but you know what it's talking about he's talking about a day
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:46.240]   in which you work the full day in which you're actually awake right and so as
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.120]   he's thinking about that there isn't a lot of time to which we're supposed to
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:57.920]   work yes and they say yeah so we're not going to be excused or killed or we're
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:03.960]   not gonna leave this scene until it's God's timing we're not gonna die early
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.800]   God's timing is set God's plan is sovereign and so Jesus Christ began
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.280]   responding to the crisis as God is going to be glorified he's reminding his own
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.160]   disciples God is going to be glorified by our work and while it is day we're
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.640]   gonna work and nothing is outside of God's timing so he's giving the
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.960]   disciples confidence and saying guys let's go stop your whining that's what
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:32.160]   he's doing and so after he says that take a look at verse 11 this he said and
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:37.760]   after he's after that he said to them our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep but
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.400]   I go so that I may awaken him out of sleep and in disciples that said to him
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:48.280]   Lord if he has fallen asleep he will recover now Jesus has spoken of his
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.720]   death but they thought that he was speaking of literal sleep so Jesus then
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:58.960]   said to them plainly Lazarus is dead okay and I just want to take a moment
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.600]   there and sometimes Bible is a little funny I think this is one of these funny
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:08.160]   moments I don't know if Jesus is one of these like you know slap in the back of
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.200]   the head it's like guys we have to go it's in God's timing God's gonna be
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:18.080]   glorified through this he's gonna do a wonderful work yet to see what's more
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:23.560]   our friend Lazarus he's asleep you know and he's using a euphemistic words to
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:28.440]   say he's dead but they're like oh come on Jesus he's being lazy you know he
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.320]   could wake up on his own just let the guy alone he's gonna wake up and Jesus
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:40.400]   like oh my god okay guys listen to me all right he's dead sometimes we're slow
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.360]   okay the fact of the matter is sometimes we're simple-minded and we don't get the
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.240]   sarcasm I can relate to that I'm really slow I don't get jokes very well
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.720]   sometimes you have to say the things to me very literally otherwise I'm like oh
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.640]   and I'm not as Korean as I think cuz I don't I don't like do the sarcastic
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.240]   thing sometimes I try and then I end up really hurting people it's not a good
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.360]   thing so I just given up on for me cuz I'm just simple-minded like that the
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:12.000]   disciples here straight up simple-minded as can be I can't believe they straight
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.920]   up said like he's gonna wake up though so it's alright yeah and Jesus is
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.440]   probably just shaking his head I bet you maybe he didn't slap his head Jesus is
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.080]   more sanctified than I am I would have slapped their heads she was probably just
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:31.720]   in one of these like let's just go okay I'm gonna respond to you um but what's
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.120]   interesting is in verse 15 Jesus says and I'm glad for your sakes that I was
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:44.280]   not there saying what I'm glad for your sake I wasn't there see this kind of
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:49.600]   talk to us humanistically sounds not only off and disconnected it sounds
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:56.160]   wrong because you understand the scenario right God has chosen to wait
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:03.080]   deliberately allowing more time for Martha and Mary to suffer they're in
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:08.280]   pain they're grieving the people are grieving they're weeping and wailing for
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:15.460]   whose sake your sake for whose benefit who gets to choose that guys God is
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:21.520]   sovereign God is mighty and he's gonna be glorified and somehow even though it
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.240]   doesn't make sense God's love and everything is going to cohesively
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:31.120]   harmonize but he says this and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there so
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:36.600]   that you may believe so let us go let us go to him so you see what's happening
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.920]   the suspense is building because in the crisis Christ did not respond to the
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:45.280]   crisis as expected but he said God will be glorified and I want you to see it
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:50.000]   and now he's saying to the disciples the same thing I want to show you this glory
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.320]   but what is it what are you going to do and then verse 16 it gets even funnier
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:03.840]   therefore Thomas who is called Didymus aka Diddy said to him let us all go and
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.480]   we're just gonna die with him and this is who I call the drama boy right he's
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.200]   like all the other disciples like I don't want to go we're gonna get stoned
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.960]   and the other guys like come on that guy's being lazy he can get up on his
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.480]   own and the other guys like come on we were gonna stay here and then Thomas is
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.360]   like fine we're gonna go let's all die you know it's like whoa buddy you're
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.000]   like too Korean you know it's just like too much drama in you I just thought I
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.600]   was hilarious that's got nothing to do with the story all right and then what
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.520]   happens is in the moment then you see the band Jesus's disciples and the band
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:41.720]   now moving over to Bethany close to Jerusalem to go now to visit the family
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:47.640]   and through that visit what you're gonna see is a character development of the
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:52.040]   story okay the character development of the story I want us to emphasize on the
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:57.840]   characters that come out now first 17 so when Jesus came he found that he had
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:03.140]   already been in the tomb four days now Bethany was near Jerusalem about two
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:07.320]   miles off and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:11.320]   concerning their brother Martha therefore when she heard that Jesus was
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:16.920]   coming went to meet him but Mary stayed at the house I'm gonna pause right there
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:21.600]   as we read this story because we may get introduced to the characters of Martha
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.840]   and Mary and it's kind of giving them a little background of where they're at
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:30.440]   there in Bethany close to Jerusalem Martha and Mary many times experienced
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.000]   Jesus's ministry because they were close and remember that Jesus would actually
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.120]   come to their house and Jesus would teach and remember Martha was the one
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.960]   enslaving away in the kitchen and she got all grumpy and she was like how come
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.160]   my sister is not you know helping me Jesus tell her rebuke her you know but
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.160]   Mary being the one more like in the moment she was like I'm gonna sit here
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.360]   and listen to my master you know and she was at Jesus's feet and Jesus said look
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.000]   she chose the better thing you know and I think you know the story is beautiful
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.920]   and stuff but what's interesting is in this story you kind of get it should be
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:05.320]   reintroduced to them and their roles are reversed now I think purposefully it's
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:10.040]   reversed because before Martha was like I'm just working by myself slaving away
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:16.280]   in the kitchen but I think now it's Mary at the home I'm pretty sure they all
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:21.720]   heard Jesus is coming Mary decides to stay kind of revealing that maybe Mary
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:27.880]   was why didn't Jesus come before right Martha having a little bit more hope
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:32.880]   goes out to meet Jesus and then she asked him this question verse 21 Martha
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:38.920]   then said to Jesus Lord if you had been here my brother would not have died even
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:43.680]   now I know that whether you ask well whether whatever you ask of God God will
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:48.080]   give you G God will give to you and Jesus said to her your brother will rise
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:53.120]   and then Martha said to him I know that he will rise again in the resurrection
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:59.400]   on the last day now you look at Martha's statement and the introduction of her
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.240]   character and what's happening in this statement is this a lot of people think
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.400]   that Martha came and she exercised great faith because she said even now if you
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:14.280]   ask God God will answer your prayer I do agree that Martha is exercising faith
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:20.320]   but she is battling doubt she is seriously battling doubt and exposed
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:25.440]   when she says this statement if you had it been here my brother would not have
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.920]   died do you see that a little bit and what you see is essentially when she
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:35.040]   says something like that it's kind of like Jesus why didn't you come earlier
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:42.760]   you could have but you didn't where were you and in that there is a subtle
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:49.720]   questioning do you care you could have prevented this right and if you've ever
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.640]   been in a fight and you've been in ever been in an argument you might have said
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.760]   some states and it's like well you could have you could have said something you
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.200]   could have been nicer you could have done this you could have done that you
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.800]   could have done this and what you're expressing is I'm disappointed in you
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:09.600]   because you didn't do what you were supposed to do right Martha I think is
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:15.840]   disappointed in Christ that's real she just lost her brother she like anybody
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:20.240]   that are human is in the face of death and death is final it seems way too late
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.520]   it seems it's all done what's the point what's to use but she's fighting that
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:29.600]   you see that she's fighting that and she's saying even now Jesus if you were
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:35.320]   to ask God God would answer you wouldn't he so she's in a moment where she's
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:42.480]   battling this unbelief and Christ and his love for her explains the truth he
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:48.920]   says Martha I am the resurrection and the life he who believes in me will live
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:53.800]   even if he dies and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die do you
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:21:00.160]   believe this you see what Jesus is doing when Jesus said your brother will rise
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:05.480]   Martha did not have faith because she immediately thought oh great here's a
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:10.080]   theologian going on about eschatology talking about the end day sure fine I
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:15.840]   agree in the end we're all gonna rise but you see what Jesus is doing Martha
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:23.160]   you are looking for a forward future day I am that day Jesus is revealing his
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:31.400]   love for her by explaining Martha I am here you are looking for something right
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.960]   now you're interpreting this entire life situation as I am just giving you words
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:41.360]   I'm just giving you theology and for you you still don't have your brother and so
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:47.120]   you're still questioning what I can do but Martha I am the resurrection I am
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:52.400]   the life I am the solution to this problem I am the hope for you and for
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:57.200]   him that is why Christ says when he state makes the statement that first I
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.520]   am the resurrection and the life he who believes in me will live even if he dies
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:09.320]   that's for Lazarus keep saying Lazarus Lazarus that's for Lazarus but then the
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:13.440]   next statement and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die that's
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:20.280]   for her Jesus is explaining his glory first primarily in the truth that he is
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:25.240]   the resurrection life hope joy everything is in him and he's here now
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:33.120]   before her she needs to see that brothers and sisters to me this points
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:41.080]   something for us sometimes we want joy sometimes we want hope we want peace we
[00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:47.760]   want love we want to solve our problem of isolation being alone being hurt not
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:53.680]   having enough feeling disappointed but the fact of the matter is still in a
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:23:01.240]   Martha's eyes that life is something that Christ can give it's not in him we
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:06.320]   need to join this together to believe that no joy no peace no hope no love is
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:11.320]   really true and real outside of the presence of Christ outside of the
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:16.640]   fellowship of Christ there's none of that in existence but we're fooled to
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:22.160]   think that there is and so Martha is saying where is it I thought you could
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.680]   do stuff I thought you could give life and healing I thought you can heal my
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:33.400]   brother but Christ and his love for her is still saying to her I'm here I'm here
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:41.200]   and so this is relevant for us as Christ asked her this question do you believe
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:48.800]   this same question is here for you and me do you believe that Christ is the
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.920]   resurrection in a life do you believe that all the benefits all the joys and
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:59.520]   all the things that come from knowing Christ is truly simply in him and so
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:05.680]   here we have Christ answering the crisis in a preliminary truth kind of fashion
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:13.160]   and this is his love for Martha now the plot begins to thicken and the plot
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:19.000]   begins to rise to its peak so in any plot you have a climactic point and here
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:27.640]   we go verse 27 so Martha after talking to Jesus she says yes Lord I have
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:32.880]   believed that you are the Christ the Son of God even he who comes into the world
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:37.920]   when she said had said this she went away and called Mary her sister saying
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:42.640]   secretly the teacher is here and he's calling for you and when she heard it
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:47.200]   she got up quickly and was coming to him now Jesus had not yet come into the
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.440]   village but was still in the place where Martha met him then the Jews who were
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.680]   with her in the house and consoling her when they saw that Mary got up quickly
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:59.560]   and went out they follow her supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:05.360]   there now before we read the next verse I just want to make mention again to get
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:10.200]   the picture of the story in our head I am only reading into the storyline as I
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:15.000]   try to picture it in my mind I could be wrong but I think Mary's a little you
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:22.480]   know she doesn't say anything and Martha secretly goes over to Mary to talk to
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:28.000]   her why because sometimes if somebody is you know when you're super sad have you
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.760]   ever been so super sad all of a sudden it turned into angry sad like you're mad
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.200]   sad or you're like kind of bitter sad right we're all of a sudden that in that
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.120]   sadness and the anger and it's just a complex emotion but there was just like
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:45.040]   you know and then when you're like that the people around you're very like you
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:54.760]   know and I just imagine Martha like like secretly and then it just kind of
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.000]   records on Martha doesn't even say anything I'm sorry Mary doesn't even say
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.400]   anything just quickly she gets up and then everybody has to suppose I guess
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:07.000]   she's going to the tomb because she's just going she can and then someone's
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.800]   like where are you okay it's like going you know that's how I picture it I could
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:19.560]   be wrong I could be wrong but I picture Mary just bottled up emotion now having
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:24.560]   spent four days with her brother in the tomb I'm not sure if you guys have ever
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:30.800]   hurt real bad and you bottled up your emotions I do that sometimes I'm not
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.640]   sure if you guys have ever clammed up you know you become a clam when you're
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.600]   angry and you start giving people a cold shoulder and you just don't say
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.600]   anything you just hold it inside and people have to give you your distance
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:49.480]   and then now she's about to explode okay verse 32 therefore when Mary came where
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:54.960]   Jesus was she saw him and she collapses she fell at his feet saying to him Lord
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:01.120]   if you'd been here my brother would not have died and when Jesus therefore saw
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:06.520]   her weeping and the Jews who came with her was also weeping he was deeply
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:10.920]   moved in his spirit and he was troubled and he said where have you laid him and
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:18.080]   they said to him Lord come and see and Jesus wept so the Jews were saying see
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:24.800]   how he loved him I asked you at the beginning of the sermon to jot down and
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   notice every time you see the love of Christ and here and now we recognize the
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:34.920]   sympathetic love of Christ was to the degree where is where Christ's emotions
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.440]   come out and the people who are gravitas looking at him and saying oh my
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:47.080]   goodness look at how much Jesus loved Lazarus see his love you can see it in
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.680]   the tears in his eyes you can see it in the emotion that comes out you can see
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:56.880]   it as he's trembling almost he's moved in the spirit and he's troubled to tell
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:02.320]   you honestly I don't know if I could have responded this way if a lady came
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:07.160]   up to me and started blaming me where were you you could have been here I was
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:15.360]   hurting you could have saved him I think I would have gotten a little bit mad but
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:24.880]   Christ in his deep love sympathy he hurts with them and he begins to weep
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:33.560]   and the people can see it we have the sympathetic Lord and Savior who loves us
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:42.280]   to such a degree we have in the Bible it says to us that we do not have a high
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:47.720]   priest who does not know but rather one who understands if you turn in your
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:51.400]   Bibles to Hebrews chapter 2 verses 10 through 18 it's a long segment of the
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:57.800]   Bible but it speaks so much of Christ's sympathy towards us it speaks so much of
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:04.040]   Christ's desire to meet us where we are Jesus sees our pain Jesus sees our
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:10.040]   slavery sin Jesus sees where we're headed in our great demise and in
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:14.560]   Hebrews chapter 2 verse 10 this is what it says please follow along it's a bit
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:20.000]   long for it was fitting for him for whom are all things and through whom are all
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.640]   things and bringing many sons to glory to perfect the author of their salvation
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:30.360]   through suffering for both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:34.680]   are all from one father for which reason he is not ashamed to call them brethren
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.400]   saying I will proclaim your name to my brethren in the midst of the congregation
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:43.240]   I will sing your praise and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:48.260]   and the children whom God has given me therefore look at this since the
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:53.560]   children share in flesh and blood since we are weak he himself likewise also
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.680]   partook of the same that through death he might render powerless him who had
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:02.240]   the power of death that is the devil and might free those who through fear of
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:07.320]   death were subject to slavery all of their lives for as surely he does not
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:12.560]   give help to angels but he gives help to the descendants of Abraham therefore he
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:18.200]   had to be made like his brethren in all things so that he might become a merciful
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:23.120]   and faithful high priest and the things pertaining to God to make propitiation
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:27.960]   for the sins of the people for since he himself was tempted in that which he has
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:35.760]   suffered he is able to aid those who are tempted he is able to come to the aid of
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:40.240]   those who are mourning if you are hurting today I want you to understand
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:46.080]   he is so able to understand you and know you if you might harden your heart and
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:51.640]   think nobody understands nobody knows what I'm going through that's a lie
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:59.040]   that's a lie Christ understands as a matter of fact the truth of the matter
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:04.720]   is Christ knows infinitely more what it means to suffer than you do and the love
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:09.120]   of Christ is seen in his sympathy for the people although Martha might come to
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.520]   and said Jesus you could have done something where were you do you really
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:21.080]   love us do you really care Christ in his simple expression of emotion proves of
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:27.280]   course he loves them he hurts for them he's come to aid them he's there now
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:33.080]   this is the love of our Lord but in this moment in which Jesus has a has an
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:38.040]   expression of great emotion and empathy there are some Jews who are saying I
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:43.400]   don't know because if you look at the story there are these doubters verse 37
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:48.880]   going back to John chapter 11 verse 37 but some of them said could not this man
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.360]   who opened the eyes of the blind have kept this man also from dying I see that
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:59.080]   as an attack on Christ why because maybe Christ feels bad maybe Christ does love
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:04.040]   but what good is your tears when my brother is in the grave that's what I
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:09.240]   hear I don't know if I'm reading way too into it but if you look Christ is
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:14.880]   constantly trying to fight doubt and so Christ says so then again being deeply
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:19.040]   moved within he comes to the tomb now it was a cave and a stone was lying against
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:23.780]   it Jesus said remove the stone Martha the sister of the deceased said to him
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:29.040]   Lord by this time there will be a stench for he has been dead for four days and
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:34.160]   Jesus said to her didn't I say to you that if you believe you will see the
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:40.840]   glory of God now the moment is intense the plot is coming to a pinnacle moment
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:49.160]   and maybe this is the comic relief Jesus says Martha remove the stone and Martha
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:33:00.720]   goes Jesus it's gonna smell bad she's she's like um it's been a while and
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:04.880]   we're just gonna get a big whiff of nasty like it's just gonna be really bad
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:11.360]   that's what she says but in that you know what I hear doubt doubt doubt all
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:16.440]   we're gonna get is a stench what's the use why move the stone we're not gonna
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:24.360]   get anything but a big whiff of death do you see the doubts and that's why Jesus
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:29.400]   responds with didn't I say to you I was gonna show you my glory Jesus wanted the
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.560]   messengers to see the glory Jesus wanted the disciples to see the glory Jesus
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:37.360]   wanted Martha and Mary to see the glory and now he's gonna want everybody all of
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:44.800]   us to see the glory you see what's really interesting about this is that I
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:52.040]   think although Christ was moved Christ was moved with sympathy for Lazarus and
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:57.880]   that's why he cried because of this because of all the doubters because of
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:01.680]   all these questioning because of all the accusation Jesus where were you did you
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:07.800]   really love us did you really care I wonder actually if Jesus cried and not
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:13.280]   simply because Lazarus was dead but Jesus cried because of the accusations
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:21.680]   questioning his love and Christ's love was welling up inside you see when the
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.080]   pastor says that Jesus was moved and stirred it talks then the Greek it
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:29.400]   really means like a storm that's stirring and moving and other passages
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.960]   of the Bible later on actually in chapter 12 Jesus used the same thing
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:37.280]   about him going to the cross in other passages when his people are stirred
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.520]   it's talking about stirred in anger it's used negatively it's not stirred with
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:47.680]   like soft love and sympathy and pity rather stir as in like you're trembling
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:54.360]   how can you question the love of Christ but that was actually the emphatic point
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:35:00.880]   of this story God is working to reveal his glory the people are doubting
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:10.240]   whether Jesus actually cares this story is crazy crazy and then what happens is
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:16.560]   this the grand finale and the miracle the resolution to the problem chapter
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:21.340]   verse 40 chapter 11 verse 40 Jesus said to her did I not say to you if you
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:26.040]   believe you will see the glory of God so they removed the stone then Jesus raised
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:31.240]   his eyes and said father I thank you that you have heard me now check this
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:36.400]   out this is super interesting I knew that you always hear me but because of
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.040]   the people standing around I said it so that they may believe that you sent me
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:46.040]   when he said these things he cried out in a loud voice Lazarus come forth and
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:51.360]   the man who had died came forth bound hand and foot and wrappings and his face
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:56.640]   was wrapped around with cloth and Jesus said to them unbind him and let him go
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:03.000]   you want us to touch him that's right he's alive he's not deceased anymore and
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.320]   verse 45 therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what he had done
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:16.960]   believed in them guys earlier we saw the love of Christ perhaps yes and his
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:23.240]   sympathy is Christ sympathetic to our pain absolutely because other passages
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:27.440]   like the book of Hebrews Colossians Ephesians everything teaches that Christ
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:34.680]   had a compassion for us and he hurt and pain over us but the greatest telling
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:39.720]   points of Christ's love for us and this story is not simply his tears but it is
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:44.840]   his resurrection mark this the people saw Christ's tears come out and the Jews
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:49.360]   said see how he loved him God in the story has been working and creating a
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.920]   drama so that when Christ would say Lazarus come out God would say see how
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:37:02.240]   he loved us Lazarus came out of the grave look how much he loved us because
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:10.000]   what is the resurrection for us it is Christ saying to us I love you and I
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.880]   will not leave you and abandon you in the grave I will exercise my power for
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:20.720]   you I will exercise my authority for you I will combine my great love and my
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:24.160]   great intention for you and I'll combine the strength that God has given me the
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.160]   authority that God has given me and I will exercise that to raise you from the
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:35.120]   dead that's resurrection for us the combining in harmony of his love and his
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:39.480]   power and his glory joined together to give you life that's the resurrection
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:46.520]   and in this great drama God has been building up and building up to show us I
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:54.920]   love you but here's the kicker but here's the you know what's more you know
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:38:02.800]   what's more amazing than that is God wants to make sure you know he loves you
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:10.800]   did you notice that did you notice from the very beginning yes it's true Jesus
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.560]   could have just said the word he could have snapped a finger blinked an eye
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:18.680]   maybe not even move just said in his mind live and then it would have been
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:25.240]   all done but God said this is going to be for my glory Jesus said I want you to
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.720]   believe Jesus showed Martha and Mary Jesus explained it Jesus said the truth
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:33.560]   Jesus described that he is a resurrection and now when the people are
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:39.640]   gathered Jesus knows God you always answer my prayer but for your sake I'm
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:47.000]   gonna say it out loud I don't know if you've ever truly felt the love of God
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.560]   but to me I feel the love of God when God says to me like he's just coming to
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:39:01.960]   us through this passage saying I just really want you to know do you know what
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:09.760]   I'm saying with that he's going out of his way to create a drama for his glory
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:15.640]   to be shown but he could have left it at his glory to be shown in the judgment of
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:24.160]   man and said see what happens when you doubt an almighty God he could have done
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:33.040]   that right look at Lazarus see what happens when you're a sinner God would
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:37.080]   have been glorified to rebuke Martha Mary and all the people of their doubt
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:44.760]   and judged them all then and there but to remain quiet to allow his emotions to
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:50.520]   come out and at the very end of it say I'm saying all this so you all know I
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:55.400]   want you to know I love you
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:09.560]   so if you turn in your Bibles to Ephesians I read this at the beginning
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:20.200]   Ephesians chapter 3 verse 14
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:33.760]   it says starting from verse 14 for this reason I bow my knees before the Father
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:39.040]   from whom every family in heaven and on earth the rise of name we owe it all to
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:43.200]   him that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:48.160]   strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner man so that Christ
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:52.760]   may dwell in your hearts through faith and that you being rooted and grounded
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:58.240]   in love may be able to comprehend with all the Saints what is the breadth length
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:03.120]   and height and depth and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:08.800]   that you may be filled with all the fullness of God perhaps you might have
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.560]   been deceived to think that you need the love of Christ to live your life
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:18.080]   absolutely wrong you need to have strength so that you could understand
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:24.720]   the love of Christ let's not look to God and be disappointed because he didn't
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:29.360]   answer our prayers the way we wanted let's remember that Christ love for us
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:36.160]   is not primarily with health wealth and sparing you from death and pain let's
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:40.400]   never interpret the things in our lives it's just something goes bad our friends
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:44.480]   don't like us we don't we feel isolated and we're alone that all of a sudden God
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:51.040]   is against us we can be in the pits even worse than Mary Martha and the brothers
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:58.640]   but we may we know that Christ loves you because we have the resurrection the
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:04.120]   whole chapter the whole book the whole gospel is built around the revelation of
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:11.200]   the glory of Christ and this is the emphasis that we see that Jesus loved
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:18.560]   Jesus loved again not by sparing us from pain but showing us his glory I pray
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.320]   that when we think about the resurrection it's not simply a
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:29.200]   apologetical proof it's not simply a indication that God is real although it
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:34.600]   is that and so much more but the promise of the resurrection for you and me is
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:39.960]   God telling his story I love you let's pray
