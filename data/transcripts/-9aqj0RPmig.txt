[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   Today, we wrap up our Wednesday series on the real-life implications of providence.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.320]   That's the theme of Pastor John's new book by that very title, Providence.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.500]   The truth that God governs over everything that he has made is gloriously true.
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.380]   And when we see it and embrace it as true and glorious, this doctrine can make a very
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.320]   deep and definite impact on how we live our lives.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.580]   So we're celebrating the implications on Wednesdays here on the podcast.
[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.700]   Last time in episode 1598, we looked at how God's providence gives us confidence to find
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.080]   purpose and to live for purpose.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.000]   That was implication number nine.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.940]   Here now with the final implication in the series, number 10, is Pastor John.
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.080]   It's fitting that here in this last session on the providence of God, we focus on the
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.980]   absolutely ultimate goal of everything.
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:08.320]   What has all the providence of God from eternity and in history been moving toward?
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:19.400]   So I would state our 10th and final and greatest real-life practical effect of seeing and savoring
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.440]   the all-embracing providence of God like this.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:32.240]   It enables us to be assured as we face all the pleasures and hardships of life, and as
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:42.000]   we finally face death and eternity, it enables us to be assured that for all eternity, God's
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:53.560]   passion to be glorified and our passion to be satisfied will not be at odds forever,
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:02.160]   but that in fact, by the glorious design of providence, God will forever be glorified
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:09.960]   in us by our forever being satisfied in him.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:17.920]   To me, there is nothing greater that I could say to you about the providence of God than
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.920]   that.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:29.360]   As the immeasurable riches of grace, God's grace, in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus—that's
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:37.120]   the phrase that Paul uses in Ephesians 2.7—as the immeasurable riches of grace in kindness
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:47.280]   toward us in Christ Jesus are poured out over us, measured out to us, forever, God will
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:58.200]   be increasingly glorified in us as we are increasingly satisfied in him, as he is increasingly
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:08.080]   lavishing on us these immeasurable and inexhaustible, never able to be boring riches forever and
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.520]   ever.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:17.640]   That is the ultimate goal of providence, and providence sees to it that this goal will
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.160]   come to pass.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:28.000]   We can be sure that it will, and we attribute to providence all of that glory.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:38.680]   Now, I know that there are some who will hear me describe the ultimate goal of providence
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:47.280]   like that and say, "That's too personal and individualistic and not corporate enough
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.440]   and not cosmic enough."
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.280]   Okay, I get that.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.760]   Let me get at the very same goal another way without contradicting anything I have just
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.840]   said or diminishing the sweetness of the individual experience of God's delighting in us and
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.040]   we delighting in him.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.440]   I don't want to diminish any of that, but let me come at it another way to see if I
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.640]   can help those folks who have this burden for corporate reality and cosmic reality that
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.000]   I'm not in any way diminishing that.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.880]   Paul says in Ephesians 5, 25 to 27, "Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.080]   that he might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of water with the word, so
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:45.780]   that he might present the church to himself in splendor without spot or wrinkle or any
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.720]   such thing that she might be holy and without blemish."
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.440]   It is fair to say, therefore, that one of the great aims, you could even include this
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.160]   in the ultimate aim of providence, is that God by the death of his son would create and
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:16.220]   purify and beautify and present to his son a stunningly gorgeous bride, the church.
[00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.700]   Not just John Piper as an individual, but the church.
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.020]   This is not just individuals.
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.220]   This is a corporate reality.
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:36.500]   Individual Christians together making up something new, a corporate bride, a beautiful,
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:45.800]   gorgeous, spotless, blameless bride for Jesus Christ to enjoy forever.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.960]   But I ask, what is her beauty?
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.600]   What is this process of beautification?
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.020]   And Paul explains in that Ephesian context.
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.400]   It is her sanctification, her holiness.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.120]   And what is holiness in the bride?
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.460]   It is her joyfully obeying all the word of God.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:17.520]   It is most essentially her loving God with all her heart and soul and mind and strength,
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.560]   which overflows in her God-glorifying love for other people.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:29.200]   It is her delight in God and her reflection of God.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:36.800]   Therefore, to express it more fully, the ultimate goal of God's providence is to glorify his
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:46.320]   grace in the spiritual and moral beauty of Christ's undeserving, blood-bought bride
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:57.240]   as she enjoys, reflects, and thus magnifies his greatness and beauty and worth above everything.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:07.240]   But even that corporate expression of God's ultimate goal needs at least one more expansion
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.560]   in order to have its biblical proportions.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:18.200]   To be sure, the ever-increasing joy of the bride in the inexhaustible riches of the glory
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:25.520]   of her bridegroom, Jesus Christ, will be the essence of how God is glorified in the coming
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.520]   ages.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.640]   Yes, I believe that, but its essence is not its totality.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:38.760]   The totality of how God is glorified is not exhausted by the joy that the bride has in
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.940]   the bridegroom.
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.240]   The bride will inhabit a new creation.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.240]   We're getting at the cosmic issue now.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.800]   And this is not incidental.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:56.560]   No, it's not, because in that new creation, she will see dimensions of the glory of God
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.560]   as never before.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.240]   The heavens will be glad.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.920]   The sun and moon and shining stars will praise the Lord.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:12.480]   The earth will rejoice.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.520]   The rivers will clap their hands.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.120]   The hills will sing for joy.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.320]   The field will exult.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:24.320]   And everything in it—the trees of the forest will chant their praise.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.380]   The desert will blossom like the crocus.
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:36.460]   The created world, liberated and perfected, will never cease, ever, to declare the glory
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.740]   of God.
[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:45.180]   That will be our dwelling, the dwelling of the bride with Christ.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:50.500]   But the dwelling is not the family.
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.440]   The new cosmos is not the relationship.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.860]   The beauty of the new world is not the bridegroom.
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:05.140]   The perfected theater of creation will be glorious, radiant with God.
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:13.420]   But the drama in the theater, the human experience of God in Christ, not the theater, will be
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:22.580]   foremost in magnifying the God of all-embracing, all-pervasive providence.
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:32.980]   And the unparalleled beauty and worth of the reigning Lamb, Jesus Christ, who was slain,
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.220]   will be the main song of eternity.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:44.380]   We will sing over the rivers and the mountains and the seas and the blossoming desert, but
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:52.020]   oh, we will sing over our bridegroom.
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:10:01.300]   And the joy of the bride will be the main echo of the excellencies of Christ and of
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:08.380]   God and the focus of his eternal delight.
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:14.260]   Running through this book like a golden thread, the book on providence, is the truth that
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:22.540]   God designed the world and performs his providence so that his glory in saving us and our joy
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:31.700]   in seeing him would be forever united and not at odds.
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:38.020]   As each increases in the increase of the other.
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:43.660]   When the immeasurable riches of God's glory in saving us through the slaying of the Lamb
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:54.700]   are forever and continually dispensed from his infinite treasury, our gladness will increase
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:00.300]   with every fresh sight and taste of his glory.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:09.300]   And as our gladness in God increases, his worth will be seen as a greater and greater
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:14.220]   treasure reflected in the pleasures of his people.
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:23.660]   The all-embracing, all-pervasive, unstoppable providence of God is precious to us in proportion
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.460]   as we hope for this day to come.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.860]   And it will come.
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:40.500]   God will forever be increasingly glorified as we are increasingly satisfied in him.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.620]   In your presence is fullness of joy.
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:49.980]   At your right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:53.780]   Be exalted, O God, above the heavens.
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.060]   Let your glory be over all the earth.
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.060]   O Lord, come.
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.060]   Come.
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.060]   Come.
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.060]   Amen.
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:07.540]   Fitting way to end our 11-part series on God's providence here on the podcast.
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.420]   Be sure to check out Pastor John's new book, Providence.
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:15.300]   And with that, we are going to resume our Wednesday sermon clips.
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.020]   So keep the clip suggestions coming in.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.100]   You can send those in to us via email.
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.140]   Go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.660]   Send us clips and send us questions.
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.780]   And if you do send a clip, make sure you put the word "clip" in the subject line so I can
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.140]   find that when I search for all the clips.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.020]   Friday we return to address whether a young woman called into missions should marry a
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.900]   boyfriend who is not.
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.420]   Very important question coming up on Friday.
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:43.260]   I'm your host Tony Reinke and Pastor John and I will see you then.
[00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:56.180]   [End of session]
