[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Just a couple of announcements before we get started.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Let's see.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   So first of all, the spiritual development courses, the sign-ups are still going on.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Again, I want to remind you, if you need help with the Bible study lab, how to do the inductive Bible study,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Pastor Mark is teaching that.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   And the first class is happening on February 6th.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   There's three classes, and it's happening at 2 p.m.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   So please sign up for that.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   The other one is we have a New Testament survey class being taught by Pastor Peter Chung.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   And the first class is starting again on February 6th, and there's four sessions for that.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   And that's also starting at 2 p.m.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   So please sign up for that.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   And then one other thing is that we have communion service on that Sunday, so February 6th.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   So please prepare your heart for that as well.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   After I pray for the offering, we're going to have a baptism of our brother David Kim.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   So he'll come up after the worship, and then he'll give the testimony, and we'll have him baptized.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   So if you're new to our church, we have a physical offering basket in the back over there.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   And then after I pray, we'll give you a few minutes to give your offering for the electronic, if you're going to give it electronically.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   All right? Let's pray.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing over this time.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   We ask, Lord God, that whatever it is, Lord, that caused our hearts to be entangled with the things in this world,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   that you would help us with your word through our worship, our giving, all of it, Lord God, as an act of worship to honor and glorify you.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   We pray that you would bless this time, bless the testimony, bless the teaching of your word,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   and bless our giving, Lord God, that it may be multiplied for your use in your kingdom.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   The molecules and planets revealed your great design.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   And everyone was made so we could see, so we could see you are Lord.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   You are the glorious Christ, the greatest of all delights.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Your power is unequal, your love beyond all heights.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   No greater sacrifice than when you lay down your life.

[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Glorious Christ.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   You left the air of heaven to breathe the dust of earth.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   And dwell among the outcast and the poor.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   You came to be forsaken.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   You came to be forsaken and died to take a curse.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   So you could be our joy forevermore.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Forevermore.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Forevermore.

[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   You're seated now in heaven.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   In throne that God's our hand.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   You shattered death and freed us from our fear.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   And though we cannot see you, you're coming back again.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   And I will be made right when you appear, yes, Lord.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   And I will be made right when you appear.

[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   in the fury of the storm.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   When the winds that blow through me
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   and my sails have all been torn.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   In the suffering, in the sorrows,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   when my sinking hopes are few, I will hold fast to the anchor.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   It shall never be removed.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Christ the sure and steady anchor
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   while the tempest rages on.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   When temptation claims the battle
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   and it seems the night has won, deeper still
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   than goes the anchor.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Though I justly stand accused, I will hold fast to the anchor.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   It shall never be removed.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Christ the sure and steady anchor
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   through the floods of unbelief.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Hopeless somehow, O my soul now, lift your eyes to Calvary.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   This my ballast of assurance, seer's love forever true.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   I will hold fast to the anchor.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   It shall never be removed.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Christ the sure and steady anchor
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   as we face the wave of death.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   When these trials give way to glory,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   as we draw our final breath, we will cross that great horizon.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Clouds behind and life secured.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   And the calm will be the better for the storm that
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   is coming.

[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   All right.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:51.800]   Mic check.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.320]   OK, perfect.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.000]   All right.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.080]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:31:00.760]   My name is David Kim, and I'm a girl dad, a husband/servant,
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.280]   photographer, cheerleader, social media manager,
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.960]   and whatever my wife says I am to my wife, Tessia.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.840]   But most importantly, I'm a sinner saved by grace
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.760]   and adopted into the family of God.
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.880]   Before I continue with the rest of this testimony,
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.960]   I just want to put a disclaimer out there.
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.760]   If any part of this testimony speaks to you
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.360]   and if it convicts anybody, that's from God.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.400]   If I totally botch it and it just goes all kinds of haywire
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.600]   and nobody knows what I've said, that was all me.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.640]   So all glory to God, all the mistakes come down to me.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:31.440]   So I just want to put that out there first.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.560]   But anyways, thank you for taking the time
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:36.080]   to hear my testimony and witnessing my baptism.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.080]   I know most of you didn't really have a choice
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.840]   and didn't know this was even happening,
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.640]   but I appreciate you guys patiently suffering with me
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.480]   next few minutes all the same.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.400]   I became a follower of Jesus Christ in 2001
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.840]   after I watched the Billy Graham crusade on TV with my father.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.800]   I prayed with my father, who was a missionary and still is,
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.560]   and accepted Christ that day.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.240]   And yes, I'm an MK, and that also
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.720]   means I have all sorts of underlying issues.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.720]   And that's just the nature of the beast.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.320]   But I should also get out of the way
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.280]   that I also received a sprinkle baptism
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.440]   and was never fully baptized through full immersion.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.480]   So although I did accept Christ, I never--
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.600]   just purely out of ignorance-- never received a full immersion.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.360]   To continue, after that day, I pursued God, or more accurately,
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.120]   God pursued me.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.000]   I found a strong community within my church
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.040]   and experienced God's love through my friends
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.320]   and the pastors that God placed in my life.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.680]   In my third year at school, however, I grew lazy
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.160]   and began harding my heart towards God's voice.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.920]   I don't have an epic, traumatic story here.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.600]   Instead, I simply stopped praying and reading the word
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.280]   as often as I used to.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.840]   And the change was so subtle but dangerous.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.360]   And over time, I simply forgot how good God is,
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.860]   just like the Israelites repeatedly
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.800]   did after their exodus from Egypt.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.680]   And I began to ask, is Jesus really all I need in life?
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.360]   I'll save you the time and the pain
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.720]   of discovering the answer to that question for yourself.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.440]   And I'll tell you, the answer is absolutely yes.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.600]   I can confidently say, as someone
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:01.440]   who got to travel all over the world through the military
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.560]   and just through some interesting experiences,
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.800]   met all kinds of people, nothing--
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.760]   and I mean absolutely nothing-- can even
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.680]   come close to the love of Christ.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.400]   At the time, when I was struggling,
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.040]   even though I thought I was free in a worldly sense,
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.000]   I was pretty miserable.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.500]   And I often joked that I even couldn't get sinning right,
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.960]   because I always felt like something
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:19.760]   was holding me back.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.180]   So I was a terrible Christian, and I was a terrible sinner.
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:25.640]   So that kind of tells you how conflicted I was back then.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.640]   I didn't know it then, but today I
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.360]   know it was the Holy Spirit relentlessly pursuing
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.360]   and protecting me as part of his mission
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.760]   to complete the good work he began in me,
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.320]   as stated in Philippians 1.6.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.280]   Now today, as my wife and I transition out
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.800]   of the military life, God continues
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.840]   to remind us of his goodness, his holiness, and providence
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.280]   every single day.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.720]   He continues to be faithful and takes care of us
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.200]   in so many ways that I can't even
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.240]   begin to cover in this short testimony.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.520]   We'll just have to get to know each other for that one.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.400]   But as I navigate this next chapter in my life,
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.940]   I look forward to seeing how God will be glorified in my life
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.560]   and the lives of those around me.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.520]   That's you guys.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.240]   And I really look forward to seeing the types of miracles
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.240]   and the blessings that he brings upon us.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.880]   Thank you for listening to my testimony,
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.440]   and I pray that you are blessed by the rest of this service.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.480]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:21.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:31.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:41.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:51.700]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:35:02.880]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.660]   >> All right, thank you, David, for that great testimony.
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:09.860]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 13.
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:17.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:20.860]   We're gonna be in the text in verse 17 through 19.
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:22.660]   It's gonna be a two part message.
[00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:26.100]   And this is a passage that you guys have all been looking forward to.
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:30.140]   Obey your leaders and submit to them, okay?
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.780]   So obey your leaders, submit to them, for
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:36.660]   they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account.
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:40.700]   Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:41.820]   you.
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.660]   Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a good conscience,
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:49.740]   desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things.
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:54.140]   And I urge you all the more to do this so that I may be restored to you sooner.
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:55.500]   Let's pray.
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.220]   Gracious Father, we pray for your blessing over this time.
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:04.060]   May your word be honored, and that you would encourage us, rebuke us,
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.700]   guide us, and build us up, Lord God, for the sake of your name.
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.140]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:15.660]   If our church was a topical message giving church,
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:19.020]   this is one of those passages that you probably will never hear, right?
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.380]   Because I don't want to give it, right?
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:25.020]   This is one of those passages that I know as soon as I hear it mentioned the word
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:29.540]   submit or obey your leaders, there's a cringing that takes place.
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:33.100]   In fact, the very first wedding that I officiated,
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:39.140]   I had an issue because the bride was having a hard time saying the word submit.
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.820]   Right, we're equals, what are you talking about, submit.
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:46.780]   And then every wedding, the husband and wife, they exchange their vows.
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:48.220]   And then when it comes to the wife's turn, and
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:52.620]   then in the vows it says I will submit to the leadership of my husband.
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.900]   And so they say that in the vows, and
[00:36:54.900 --> 00:37:00.380]   I know every wedding there's always some cringing that takes place, right?
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:04.980]   And rightfully so, because of the abuse.
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:09.940]   Because especially if you've been raised in the Western culture,
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:14.420]   questioning leadership is part of maturity, right?
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:18.540]   We're not dumb, we're not naive, what do they know more than we do?
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.980]   Why do we need to submit to them?
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:22.740]   Especially right now, the last couple years,
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.900]   there's so many things that have happened in government and in media.
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.740]   That it's all time low to trust in any kind of leadership.
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:35.740]   In fact, they did a survey and found that 66% of people who were surveyed
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:41.220]   believe that government is deliberately misleading people, 66%.
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:46.060]   Now, if it was just one political party, right, it wouldn't be 66%.
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:49.180]   66% basically represents a majority of people,
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:51.140]   no matter what party you're part of.
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:56.140]   63% believe that business executives are not to be trusted, right?
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:59.460]   Whatever they're selling you, whatever they're telling you,
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.060]   it's not for your own good.
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:04.940]   67% believe that media is deliberately misleading people.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:10.820]   So trust in media, news organization who supposedly are just telling us
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:16.220]   facts of what has happened, 67% of the people don't trust in the media anymore.
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:21.420]   Now, all of these things are referenced to secular leadership, but
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:29.180]   it's sad to say that that number correlates exactly with how they view church today.
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:33.860]   They said that the trust in church and its leadership is at an all time low.
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:38.780]   And 66 to 67% of people who are interviewed in our culture say
[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.980]   the church is not to be trusted.
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:44.340]   And the leadership of the church specifically is not to be trusted.
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:51.020]   So it's in that context we read, obey your leaders and submit to them, right?
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:54.820]   So some of you who may have already looked into this text, and
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:57.220]   maybe you looked at Facebook and said, we're gonna be in this text.
[00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:00.860]   And if there's one verse that I'd like to skip and
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:05.420]   just kind of not sit in the service, it may be this one.
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:10.300]   And not just for general reasons, some of you, including myself,
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:14.980]   have very painful experience of putting your confidence in a leader and
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:16.140]   them disappointing you.
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:19.540]   And so you have a scar that's probably gonna last the rest of your life.
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:23.300]   And maybe as a result of that, you've determined in your heart that I will never
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.780]   put myself in this position again.
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:30.940]   So you've resolved, I'm just gonna kinda be there, but to really put my confidence
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.740]   and trust, let alone to obey and to submit leadership.
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:37.380]   And this is not something that I can do.
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:41.220]   I've had a friend who was burned by that kind of leadership.
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:44.860]   And I remember him specifically telling me, coming out of that ministry,
[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:47.820]   he's like, I will never follow another man.
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.420]   I understand where that's coming from,
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:54.260]   because that distrust of leadership did not come from a vacuum.
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:40:02.780]   Every single one of us can probably point to, either from personal experience or
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:08.700]   from things that you've heard recently or in the past, somebody who was a leader,
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:12.700]   who was trusted, who was gifted, who embezzled the church, or
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:17.820]   had an affair with his secretary, or completely led to double life.
[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:23.580]   In fact, this may not be true of every single one of you, but
[00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:30.340]   I think most of you can easily name people who have discouraged you or
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:32.820]   they didn't live up to what they were supposed to do.
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:37.340]   And you can give examples, maybe even in the dozens.
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:40.940]   And then if I was to ask you a pastor or a leader that you really,
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:44.540]   when you think of, that's the kind of man that I would follow and
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:47.500]   I would submit to, that you'd have to think really long and
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:48.940]   hard if you can even find anybody.
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:54.100]   Every single one of us has had some kind of experience,
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:55.900]   maybe in different degrees.
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.060]   And like I said, it doesn't come from a vacuum.
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:04.180]   I remember years ago, I had a friend who asked me to come and
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.860]   speak at a youth conference when I was a youth pastor.
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:12.700]   And basically, it was supposed to be a large conference in Colorado, and
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.860]   they had about six, seven churches get together.
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:21.140]   And they got a newspaper advertisement advertising this event with my name on it.
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.620]   Saying that Pastor Peter Kim from SoCal is gonna come,
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:27.300]   he's gonna preach to the youth, we're inviting everybody to come.
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:31.700]   And then I showed up, and then my friend kind of warned me ahead of time.
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.980]   He said, we were expecting so many people, but
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.580]   a lot of them dropped out at the last minute.
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:37.820]   And I said, so what happened?
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.980]   I said, when they found out that Peter Kim was coming,
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:44.740]   they said that they got upset and they just basically called and
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:47.540]   say I'm not coming, and they disappeared.
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:50.020]   So I said, Peter Kim, how do they even know who I am?
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:53.380]   You know what I mean? What did I do in SoCal that my name
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.220]   got dragged over in Colorado?
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:59.500]   So basically what happened was, a couple weeks before I showed up,
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:04.340]   another youth pastor made the news because he ended up sexually assaulting
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.060]   one of his students.
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.700]   And the student ended up telling the police, and then it got into the newspaper,
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:14.260]   and this young Pastor Peter Kim was in the newspaper.
[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.740]   And then the very next thing that was on the newspaper is Pastor Peter Kim is
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:21.140]   speaking at a youth conference.
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:24.740]   And so he didn't even know what was going on, and then he got the news.
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.540]   And then so as soon as he found out what was going on,
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.540]   he started contacting some of his friends.
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:33.280]   So the few friends that he knew that was coming, he told them, so they came.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:36.780]   But everybody else that didn't have that direct contact,
[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.460]   by the time that they found out what was going on, they just dropped out and
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.500]   they couldn't come.
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:49.100]   Now, as sad as that story is, when people think of leadership,
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:54.180]   if you experienced that, or you knew somebody who experienced that type of
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:58.740]   abuse, I mean, that's tainted your idea of leadership.
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:00.500]   Not just for that moment, not just for that purpose.
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.620]   We have a most likely, well, who knows?
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.900]   He's Peter Kim too, right?
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.700]   Who knows?
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:10.580]   And so as a result, you kind of harden your heart and you said,
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:11.340]   "No, I can't do that.
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:15.980]   I know what the Bible says, but it's not practical."
[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:21.860]   So knowing that, knowing that this is a subject that is cringeworthy for people
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:26.820]   to hear, if it was up to me, I would easily avoid this subject.
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:33.500]   I can spend the rest of my pastoral life preaching, choosing subjects that would be
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.580]   much easier to preach.
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:38.860]   And you'd be encouraged and maybe thanked before, maybe even grow the church
[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:40.100]   as a result.
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.780]   But we don't preach the Bible that way.
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:44.860]   We preach expository for a reason.
[00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:48.820]   Because there are passages that I personally prefer to stay away from,
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:50.300]   but God does not.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.660]   This passage is here for a reason.
[00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:59.340]   So what I want to do this morning is go through five different things that leaders
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:00.020]   are called to do.
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:02.780]   And when I say leaders, I'm specifically referring to elders
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:03.700]   and pastors.
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:07.220]   Our church, elders and pastors, they function in the same way.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:11.300]   The only reason why we separate the elders and pastors is for logistical reasons.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:11.900]   Okay?
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:15.460]   And I'm not going to get into that right now, but the elders and leaders are
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:18.660]   in reference to because they're the ones who are functioning as leaders
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:19.820]   in the church.
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.100]   It's a two-part sermon.
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:26.500]   First part today is for the leadership, okay?
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:33.180]   Because the call to obey and to submit is a conditional call.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.100]   It's not unconditional.
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:42.540]   It's specifically to submit and to obey because what the leaders are called to do.
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:46.300]   And so it's not like no matter what they do, submit to them as you would submit
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:48.140]   to Christ because they know better than anybody else.
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:52.380]   That is not the call of what this text is saying.
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:56.820]   It is a conditional call because of the work that the leaders are called to do.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:00.860]   So today, you won't be cringing, okay?
[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:05.260]   If anybody's going to be cringing, it's going to be the leaders, including myself.
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:09.540]   And based on that, we're going to move to the second part.
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:13.580]   Only when we understand the calling of the leadership where the second part is going
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.900]   to make more sense, right?
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:17.300]   Because this is not a hierarchy.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.940]   It's like, "Well, just because they have the title, you just do whatever they tell
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:21.660]   you to do," right?
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:23.780]   It's because of what we have been called to do.
[00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:27.820]   So there's five things that I want to bring up that the Bible makes it clear,
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:32.300]   the weightiness of the call to leadership.
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:39.900]   First call, the first call of the leaders in the church are to be undershepherds
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:42.340]   of Christ.
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:48.020]   I am not the head of this church, and the elders are not collectively the
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:49.420]   head of this church.
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:52.500]   There's only one head of the church, that's Christ.
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:56.140]   We are members of the church just like anybody else, except we play the role
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:57.300]   of a leader.
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:01.460]   And so the role of a leader is to be the undershepherd, meaning that we say what he
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:04.500]   tells us to say, we do what he tells us to do.
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.700]   And so we are not leaders independently of ourselves.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:12.020]   That's what makes the leadership of God's church unique.
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:15.740]   We are not CEOs where we have our own vision and what we want.
[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:19.980]   We are simply undershepherds, ambassadors of what Christ desires of us.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:25.380]   So your submission and obedience to the eldership and to leadership is simply an
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:28.980]   avenue to obey and to submit to Christ.
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:33.260]   So if the elders are not submitted to the leaders, or elders are not submitted
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:38.500]   to Christ, he does not have authority by himself.
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:45.580]   If you remember the Israelites, if you are a king, there is nobody above you.
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:51.500]   So in a typical setting, if David committed adultery and then he murdered,
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:54.260]   he didn't break any law.
[00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:56.340]   He didn't break any law because he's the king.
[00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:58.500]   He's the one who makes the law.
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:46:59.660]   He could just say, "You know what?
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.540]   From now on, the king could do whatever he wants."
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:03.980]   So there was nobody to indict him.
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:05.140]   There is no Supreme Court.
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:10.580]   There is no justice system that you can drag the king into.
[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:15.500]   But what's unique about Israelites king is that he was not the ultimate king.
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:19.100]   The king of Israel was God himself.
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:24.060]   And so the kings are established basically to carry out what God desired for them.
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:27.460]   That's why Saul got into trouble because whenever God told him to do something,
[00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:30.780]   he acted like he was the king and he did whatever.
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:33.100]   And that's why his kingship was taken away.
[00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:39.340]   So the eldership and the leadership of the church is ultimately Christ.
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:43.820]   And the leadership of the church is simply, we are called to be undershepherds.
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:48.220]   In Jeremiah 23, 21, it says, "I did not send these prophets, but they ran.
[00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.860]   I did not speak to them, but they prophesied."
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:52.780]   They kept on speaking.
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.900]   In other words, they're not representing God.
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.460]   They're speaking of their opinion.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:58.580]   This is my experience.
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.660]   This is what I learned.
[00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:03.020]   This is what I know to be wise.
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:06.140]   I've been doing this for a long time, so you should listen to me.
[00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:08.820]   It says, "No, I did not speak to them.
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:13.500]   And what they're saying to you is just their opinion."
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:17.780]   That's why we make sure that when we speak, that we're not telling you,
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:20.020]   that my authority does not come from my experience.
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:21.140]   Like, "Yeah, I'm older than you.
[00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:22.060]   I've been experienced.
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.260]   I've been doing this for a long time."
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:26.340]   Don't listen to me.
[00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:29.860]   Your experience is just as valid as my experience.
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:32.900]   The only authority that I have is authority given to me by Christ.
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:37.980]   That's why if you read the New Testament, the introduction almost always starts
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:45.900]   by saying, "Apostle, a servant of Christ, a slave of Christ," or "Apostle Paul," right?
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:49.380]   And he's connecting himself because the authority of the letter doesn't
[00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:51.020]   come from him.
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:54.340]   The authority of the letter comes from Christ himself.
[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:57.540]   So, Paul is making it very clear that the content of this letter,
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:01.660]   even though I am writing this letter, I am writing to you, another human being
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:07.740]   writing to you, but the authority of this letter is coming from Christ himself.
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:14.740]   So, we are simply under shepherds, representing who God is.
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:20.260]   Paul says in Galatians 1.10, "For am I now seeking the favor of men or of God?
[00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:21.580]   Or am I striving to please men?
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:26.260]   If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ."
[00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:30.660]   First and foremost, we're not your servants.
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:34.580]   Yes, we choose to be your servants because we want to serve you,
[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:39.780]   but the calling is not to be a servant of the people.
[00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:45.180]   That's why when Apostle Paul wrote Galatians 1.10, he was saying that because he had
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:50.020]   to rebuke Apostle Peter and Barnabas.
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:57.060]   Apostle Peter, he's the head honcho among the apostles, and Barnabas was his mentor
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.220]   who came alongside to protect him.
[00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:04.140]   So, if he had any human reason to be shy about what he was about to say,
[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:06.340]   it would be in this context.
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:10.140]   It would have been easier for Paul to compromise and say, "Well, you know,
[00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:12.460]   they're not teaching anything wrong.
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:15.660]   They're just refusing to sit with the Gentiles."
[00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:19.740]   But the problem was the gospel was just starting to come into the church,
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:23.100]   and their behavior was confusing.
[00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:26.780]   And it was giving credibility to the Judaizers.
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:29.540]   So, it could have been easy, like, "Oh, if I say this, what if this backfires,
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:33.380]   and what if this creates a rift between Apostle Peter and myself,
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:36.940]   and what Barnabas was so loyal to me, he's the one who stood up for me,
[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:39.060]   and God, he's telling me to be gracious.
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:42.420]   Shouldn't I be gracious in this situation?"
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:46.060]   He could have had all kinds of human reasons to sweep this under the rug,
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.380]   and hopefully it'll take care of itself.
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:53.500]   And he says, "No, if I did that, I would be a servant of man and not God."
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:56.340]   And so he comes out and says, "If anybody preaches a different gospel
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:59.340]   other than what I preach to you, let him be anathema."
[00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.660]   And you know who he's referring to?
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:05.020]   Peter and Barnabas.
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:08.420]   If they don't correct themselves, and they allow this confusion
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:11.060]   to penetrate into the church, let them be anathema.
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:14.900]   Even if I did it, even if an angel of God comes, let him be anathema.
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:22.500]   This is this important because Paul is saying, "I represent God, not man."
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:27.820]   First and foremost, the calling of the leaders are to represent Christ.
[00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:33.220]   That's why his personal relationship with Christ is essential to his calling.
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:39.340]   Not his peachy, not his doctorate, not simply because he had many experience,
[00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:41.260]   but his personal walk with God.
[00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:46.420]   He must know Christ in order for him to represent Christ.
[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:51.140]   Christ must speak to him in order for him to speak what Christ spoke to him.
[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:56.020]   Through the Word, obviously, because we are simply under shepherds.
[00:51:56.020 --> 00:52:00.500]   1 Thessalonians 2.34, "For our exhortation does not come from error or impurity
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:03.420]   or by way of deceit, but just as we have been approved by God
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:07.660]   to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men,
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:12.100]   but God who examines our hearts."
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:15.860]   Who doesn't want to be in this situation where, you know,
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:20.860]   I've been doing this long enough to know that there are certain things that if I say it,
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:26.300]   like I'm going to have a lot of compliments, encouragement.
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:31.980]   "Thank you so much. I was so wearied and tired, and your sermon just lifted me up.
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:37.380]   And when I hear that, I'm encouraged. I have a better week.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:41.780]   I look forward to coming to church because everybody's thankful that I'm here."
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:45.460]   Every once in a while, I'll give a sermon and I say something, and then it's like,
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:50.660]   "Oh, he's legalistic. He's judgmental. He's too harsh."
[00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:53.940]   Yeah, and I have a bad week that week.
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:59.100]   And then when I come to church, I'm aware there are some certain people that don't like it.
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:02.820]   So if it was up to me, if it was up to my flesh,
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:06.460]   I could spend the rest of my years avoiding those topics
[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:11.180]   and just get to those subjects that's going to be encouraging to people.
[00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:16.860]   But if I did that, I wouldn't be a servant of Christ. I would be your servant.
[00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:23.340]   If what we do and do not do at this church is simply based upon what you want, your opinions,
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:28.420]   then I've been hired to be the social worker for you.
[00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:34.820]   And to be honest, earlier part of ministry, that's what I thought I was called to do, right?
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:39.500]   If people come to church and they're not happy and it doesn't grow, that means I'm failing.
[00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:45.460]   And so I figured out early on as a youth pastor how to get people to come to church
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:49.660]   and how to get them to want to come to church and keep them at church.
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:54.460]   You know, tell a lot of funny stories, and I got plenty.
[00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:57.380]   You know, I got a lot of funny stories.
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:00.500]   And keep it short, keep it entertaining, right?
[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:04.220]   So I can keep everybody engaged for a short period of time,
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:08.300]   and then give you plenty of time to go to a cafe, play basketball,
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:12.700]   and people are happy, the church is growing, and you know, my family is taken care of.
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:16.860]   I figured out early on.
[00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:19.660]   But it's so empty.
[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:25.340]   Because if that was my goal, I could have been a businessman, made a lot of money,
[00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:32.580]   and do all of that, fulfill all of my desires with money, you know?
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:34.500]   But that's not what I'm called to do. It's just so empty.
[00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:40.140]   So at the end of my life, what if you have a 10,000-member church,
[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:42.980]   but the people don't love Christ?
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.300]   Then what did you do?
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:50.460]   Other than propagate religiousness of our culture, which is what God hates,
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:56.980]   he says he detests, then I become a propagator of what he says he detests.
[00:54:56.980 --> 00:55:03.380]   So I remember early on thinking, I am not a servant of the church, first and foremost.
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:09.500]   There's things that I will say that you are not going to like.
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:13.820]   But the only reason why I would need to say that is because I'm concerned
[00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:16.980]   about what he would say if I don't say it.
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:20.980]   Today is one of those sermons, right?
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:24.900]   I am not a servant of man, first and foremost.
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:26.460]   I am his servant.
[00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:29.300]   He's the one, 1 Thessalonians 2, verse 4, it says,
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:34.620]   "Not as pleasing men, but God who examines our hearts," first and foremost.
[00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:40.740]   Number two, the responsibility of elders and pastors is to teach the word.
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:45.580]   It says in 2 Timothy 4, "Preach the word in season and out of season."
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:48.140]   The reason why Paul is writing that, in season and out of season,
[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:50.700]   is because he was out of season.
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:53.100]   Paul is sitting in prison. He's about to be beheaded.
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:56.060]   That's the last letter he writes before he dies.
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:56:02.180]   You know, early on in the church, it's almost exciting to be persecuted.
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:07.820]   Because Apostle Paul, I mean, think how exciting it is that Apostle Paul gets stoned.
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:12.220]   They drag him out. He gets back up.
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:15.860]   He goes back and he preaches. And he continues on.
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:19.540]   Can you imagine if you heard that if you were with him?
[00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:23.140]   You know what happened? They tried to kill him. They couldn't kill him.
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:26.700]   Can you imagine the excitement that must have spread in the church
[00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:33.860]   that this man who was anointed by God literally is just escaping death, just like Jesus?
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:35.980]   They wanted to kill him. He would just walk through the crowd.
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:38.860]   They're hungry. And then they would just find food just anywhere.
[00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:42.220]   Apostle Paul and the other apostles experienced that kind of miracle.
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:43.900]   Can you imagine the excitement?
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:48.740]   So in the early church, even with the persecution, there was this buzz.
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:54.740]   But by the time 2 Timothy is being written, people are actually dying.
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:57.700]   They're being stoned and they're not getting up.
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:00.540]   They're in prison, but they're not getting back out.
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:06.300]   Paul is writing this letter. If you notice Philippians, there's almost this hope.
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:10.140]   Like this has actually caused benefit in the spreading of the gospel.
[00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:12.980]   This is good. More people are preaching the gospel
[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:15.620]   because they're becoming bold because of my imprisonment.
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:18.260]   And he says, I am sure that I'm going to be delivered from all of this
[00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:19.900]   because I have more work to be done.
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.660]   2 Timothy says, I'm being poured out like a drink offering.
[00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:27.340]   This is the end. Paul's about to go and he knows it.
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:30.740]   And the church knows it. And the people know it.
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:33.780]   And as a result of that, people start slipping away.
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.460]   They start backsliding.
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:39.100]   And so he's writing this letter to his young protege, Timothy,
[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:43.060]   sending him and establishing him as the pastor of the church of Ephesus,
[00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:47.740]   which Paul loved, probably more than other churches.
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:54.820]   And he's telling Timothy, you preach the word in season and out of season.
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:57.900]   In other words, whether they listen or don't listen,
[00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:06.940]   whether you live or whether you die, you preach the word in season and out of season.
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:12.380]   The primary call of a leader in the church is to not to compromise the word of God,
[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:14.780]   especially in this culture.
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:18.340]   There may be greater and greater consequences that come
[00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:22.820]   because what we believe is in direct contradiction to what the world says.
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:28.300]   More and more, the fundamental doctrines of Christianity,
[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:32.580]   they're labeling it, hate speech.
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:39.220]   So if we are servants of men, automatically you are disqualified
[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:43.660]   because you can no longer stand between the gap with the pressure that's coming.
[00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:48.020]   I mean, right now, in my opinion, it's a joke.
[00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:51.820]   As much as it's because we've lived so comfortably for so long.
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:55.860]   It's like, oh my gosh, they're erasing us from YouTube.
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:59:01.380]   Oh my gosh, they're saying that we're giving hate speech.
[00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:04.740]   Think about what's been happening around the world.
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:07.180]   Think about what's been happening, what is happening.
[00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:12.700]   People are literally being stoned and burned at the stake for their faith.
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:15.180]   It's just that God has blessed this country for so long
[00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:19.380]   that any little discomfort, we say, oh my God, it's persecution.
[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:25.860]   And if we can't even stand against that, if we're going to fold because of that,
[00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:30.060]   you're no longer a servant of Christ, you're a servant of men.
[00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:36.580]   If we pick and choose what we say and don't say because how people will respond,
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:40.420]   you're no longer representing Christ.
[00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:42.580]   You're no longer representing Christ.
[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:44.020]   You're serving man.
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:48.460]   Ezekiel chapter 3, 17 to 19, it says, "Son of man, I have appointed you a watchman
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:50.780]   to the house of Israel.
[00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:54.540]   Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, warn them from me.
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:58.340]   When I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' and you do not warn him or speak out
[00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:03.060]   to warn the wicked from his wicked way, that he may live, that wicked man shall die
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:07.300]   in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:11.380]   Yet if you have warned the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness or from
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:17.300]   his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity, but you have delivered yourself.
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:24.780]   If all you are committed to as a leader is the praise of men, you are disqualified."
[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:28.180]   Because you can no longer represent Christ accurately.
[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:33.020]   You cannot pick and choose that this is pleasing to men, so I will represent this,
[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.300]   so I'm going to sleep under the rug.
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:36.020]   You cannot do that.
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:42.580]   He says, "If I tell you that this is the state of men and you do not warn them because
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:49.020]   your idea of Christ is mercy and grace at all costs, even if you're going to hell,
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:55.140]   mercy and grace at all costs, and you refuse to warn and call out the wolves that are coming
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:59.300]   into the church, destroying the church, then you no longer are representative of Christ,
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:04.300]   you are representative of the people."
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:10.980]   The leaders of the church are called to be an ambassador of Christ, to speak on behalf
[01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:14.620]   of what he would say.
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:18.300]   We cannot avoid the cross at all costs.
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:22.080]   There's a reason why Jesus says it to his disciples, "If you want to come after me,
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:25.100]   you too have to pick up the cross."
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:29.940]   Do not think it's strange that they reject you.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:32.120]   They rejected me.
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:36.540]   We can't be popular and cool when Jesus is not popular and cool.
[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:40.460]   We cannot be loved and honored when Jesus is not loved and honored.
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:43.780]   If they reject him, they have to reject us.
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:51.080]   We cannot live in a culture where leaders are praised while the culture hates Jesus.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:55.200]   Then we no longer are representatives of Christ.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.020]   If they hate him, they have to hate us.
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:04.800]   If they think he's weird, they have to think we're weird, because we are simply undershepherds
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:09.540]   to teach the word of God accurately, to say what he says.
[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:14.940]   Apostle Paul says in Acts 20, verse 20, he says, "How I did not shrink from declaring
[01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:20.420]   to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly and from house to house, solemnly
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:28.480]   testifying both to Jews and Greeks of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ."
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.080]   Repentance toward Christ.
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:34.600]   Our primary call of preaching the gospel is to bring people to repentance.
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:39.800]   You say, "Wow, I get repentance every week.
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.200]   Repentance."
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:47.440]   If you have not tasted the goodness of God and you're committed to nominal Christianity,
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:51.360]   I mean, this is cringeworthy.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:55.360]   That means every time you come to church, you're being called to turn, because repentance
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:00.760]   means to turn, turn from the world and turn toward God.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:06.200]   But if you've hardened your heart and you don't want to do that, I think this is who
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.960]   Jesus is and this is what I want.
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:11.680]   I want to live my life where I have these things and I don't want people to judge me
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:16.840]   of my sins, because I'm okay with this.
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:20.560]   It's not that you're not committed to Christ or the Bible.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:23.920]   You're committed to Christ of the culture.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.000]   And you know what the Bible says about that.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.160]   That's not true faith.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.660]   That's not true salvation.
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:34.680]   But it's okay because everybody else seems to be okay with it.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:41.440]   We're called to preach the word in season and out of season, because the only way that
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:47.200]   you will find true life is not to be comfortable in your sins, but to bring you to repentance
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:51.600]   so that you can have a much more intimate relationship with Christ.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:56.320]   And if I'm not convinced that that's what's best for you, I shouldn't be here.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:04.920]   If I'm not absolutely convinced that the best thing for you is to put away your sins and
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:10.800]   to cling to Christ with all your might, even if the things that you're comfortable with
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:21.800]   brings peace and satisfaction, that if I don't warn you and tell you that anything that causes
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:28.040]   you to be distant from Christ is the source of the contention in your life, then I do
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.480]   not belong here.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:36.800]   Because my primary task is to teach the word of God in season and out of season.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:43.120]   Thirdly, the leaders must lead a life for others to follow.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:45.720]   And let me honestly say this.
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:52.560]   Leaders have the potential to be the biggest hypocrites in the church.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:56.520]   Leaders have the potential to be the biggest hypocrites at the church, and especially me,
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:00.320]   because I'm here preaching every single Sunday.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.960]   And what I preach is not something that I can do.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.480]   I'm not telling you because I'm more disciplined than other people, that I'm more righteous,
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:11.200]   that my heart is more sanctified than anybody else.
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.760]   I'm just telling you what I see.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.480]   But it is not enough just to tell you.
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:21.040]   He says in Hebrews 13, 7, "Remember those who led you, who spoke the word of God to
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:27.720]   you, considering the result of their conduct, imitate their faith."
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:33.520]   You cannot preach the word of God and say, "Do as I tell you, but don't do what I do."
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.200]   If that's what you say, you're disqualified.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:46.240]   A leader, by the simple definition of leader, is when people follow you.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.480]   You're not a leader because you're ordained.
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:50.600]   You're not a leader because you have knowledge.
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:53.800]   You're not a leader because you have much experience.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.120]   You're a leader because people follow you.
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:00.360]   So if you cannot say, "Follow me as I follow Christ."
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:04.880]   If all the leader is, I'm going to tell you what you should do, and I hope you just go
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:05.880]   and do it.
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.720]   Then you're not the leader.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:14.720]   The leader is a person who has been called to stand between the gap between the church
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:19.360]   and to Christ and to tell them, "Imitate me as I imitate Christ.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.240]   Follow me as I follow Christ."
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:26.480]   So it is not just the preaching, but his very life needs to be in that gap.
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:31.160]   First Peter 5, 2-4, "Shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight, not under
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:36.040]   compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God, not for sordid gain, but
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:41.000]   with eagerness, nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge."
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.040]   In other words, don't force your opinions on other people.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:48.160]   "But proving to be examples to the flock.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:53.640]   And when the chief shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory."
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:07:01.440]   That our lives must stand between the gap and saying, "Follow us as I follow Christ."
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:09.060]   There's a reason why in the qualifications of elders, everything is about character.
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:11.720]   Everything about the qualification of an elder is a character.
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:16.360]   I mean, think about how people come into ministry today.
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:20.200]   Think about how leaders are often chosen today, right?
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.520]   Usually you want giftedness.
[01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.360]   Are they gifted?
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.520]   Are they successful?
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:32.560]   And typically if you're successful in the secular life, maybe that'll translate into
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:35.280]   success in the church life.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:40.840]   And so if you have a large business, if you are a famous politician, or you're a doctor
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:47.100]   and you're very well educated, and so by secular reasoning, if you have all those qualities,
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:48.680]   that may translate into the church.
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:55.160]   But the problem is, the primary character and the only things that God tells us to look
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:58.040]   for is His character.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.920]   And He says, "But he needs to be able to teach."
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.080]   Oh, He says, "able to teach."
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:05.480]   I think able to teach is not just talking about skill.
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:11.200]   If you don't have the character, you can't teach.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.560]   Because no one's going to listen to you.
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:14.780]   You may be skilled at articulating.
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:19.160]   You may have knowledge to present, but no one's going to listen because they don't respect
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.400]   your character.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:29.360]   So even the calling to be able to teach is related to the character, who you are.
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:35.080]   And so He says, a leader not only must understand that he is an under-shepherd of Christ, that
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:40.920]   he has to preach the Word accurately in season and out of season, he needs to set an example
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:44.000]   of what that looks like in his life.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:53.120]   You can't say, "We need to be like this with our finances, but don't look at my books."
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:58.480]   You need to have lordship with your finances, but I don't want anybody looking at my books,
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:01.480]   at my expenses.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:05.480]   Because I want to tell you what's right, but I don't want to show you.
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:08.680]   No, we must speak and we must show.
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:15.560]   I remember years ago, there was this one particular church that I was a part of.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:19.200]   Some of you, some of you, a few of you may know.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:25.760]   The senior pastor left, and then they were looking for another pastor to come in.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:30.360]   And as the other pastor was coming in, you know, they found a Southern Baptist pastor,
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:31.880]   and they were really excited about him.
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.040]   He was Southern Baptist educated.
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:38.880]   And so they were about to make the decision, and all of a sudden, the very next week, we
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:43.000]   had a guest speaker that came, and they loved his sermon.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.160]   You know, and almost overnight, within a month period, they decided to go with the other
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.160]   guy.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.160]   And I said, "What happened?"
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.720]   He said, "Oh, his sermon was so great."
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.280]   And I was asking the leaders, "What happened?"
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:54.680]   I thought you guys already made a decision.
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.840]   He said, "Well, his sermon, the whole church loved his sermon."
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:01.960]   And I found out that he wasn't a Baptist, he was a Methodist guy.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:02.960]   And then I said, "Okay."
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:06.920]   You know, and at that time, I was kind of like, "Okay, you know, I'm a young kid, so
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:07.920]   I'm not going to question this."
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:12.800]   And then he comes in, the first thing he does is he changes the sanctuary, and he removes
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.120]   the pulpit from the middle to the right.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:18.600]   Now, most people, you know, it's like, "Well, what's the big deal?"
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:23.240]   Because Methodist and Presbyterian churches, they have the pulpit to the right, and they
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:25.280]   have the altar in the middle.
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:30.040]   Baptist churches have the pulpit in the middle to say that the Word of God is central.
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:33.800]   But in a Presbyterian and a Methodist, it's the altar is at the center, so the communion
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.160]   and those activities are at the center.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:39.560]   So as soon as he changed that, I kind of said, "Oh, okay.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.440]   So he's going to start doing that."
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.840]   But that in and of itself was not a big deal, right?
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.760]   Okay, so he changes it, you know.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:52.560]   He doesn't have the same mindset, so it was kind of like bells ringing, you know.
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:56.880]   And then for the first maybe about six months, everybody loved him.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.960]   And part of the reason why they loved him is because they loved his sermon.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:03.840]   And second, he was really good at golf.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:08.080]   And people loved him because, you know, people at church playing golf, and so he would go
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.360]   with them to play golf, and he was hanging out with the people playing golf, and they
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.360]   loved him.
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.560]   It's like, "Oh, our pastor is like one of us, and he's playing golf," and you know.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:20.340]   And so they loved him for that because he was one of them.
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:26.040]   And then during that period, I ended up going to another church to join my former mentor,
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:27.640]   and I was there for a little bit.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:31.720]   And then after about six, seven months, I start getting these phone calls from people
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:35.600]   that there's grumbling and stuff going on over there, and they're thinking about removing
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:38.560]   that pastor who was only there for probably less than a year.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:39.880]   And so I asked him, "So what's going on?"
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:46.640]   And he said, "All he does is play golf Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:47.640]   He's on the field.
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.640]   Every time we try to get to him, he's playing golf."
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:57.600]   And the problem with that decision was their whole leadership, why they wanted him was
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:02.400]   based upon the quality of his sermon.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:12.380]   Sad to say, in our generation, if you're gifted and you can lead well, you're the guy.
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:15.980]   And part of the reason why the church is in the condition that it is today is because
[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:17.360]   of that.
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:23.000]   We didn't pay attention to the seriousness of what the Scripture says of the high calling
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.600]   to be a leader.
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:31.520]   He says in 2 Timothy 2:34, it says, "Suffer hardship with me as a good soldier of Christ
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:32.520]   Jesus."
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:33.520]   He's talking to Paul.
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:38.280]   "No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life."
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.040]   He's talking to pastors.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:45.000]   Obviously, pastors are to set an example for everybody else, and the elders are included
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.560]   in this.
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:52.880]   Affairs of everyday life.
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.400]   What's so bad about that?
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:13:00.800]   Like, get a job, pay your bills, take care of your children, make sure you have enough
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:06.000]   retirement, my wife is taken care of, that I make proper investments so that I can make
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   more money.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.560]   Those are all civilian affairs.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:14.400]   So is he saying that leaders shouldn't be engaged in that at all?
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:19.160]   Like, you're supposed to be a monk, right?
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:22.360]   Go to the mountain and wear a robe and have no earthly possession.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.360]   What is he talking about?
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:29.000]   Don't get entangled with civilian affairs.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:38.480]   The leaders of the church have to be committed to the gospel ministry above everything else.
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:41.040]   Above everything else.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:48.120]   This needs to be not just something that you do, but this needs to be your primary passion.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:54.200]   I remember years ago when things were tough and I couldn't pay the bills.
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:59.960]   I was having a hard time, you know, even just getting grocery.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:07.640]   This is my wife with two young children, with our third one in the stomach, having complications,
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:12.240]   and the church was so young at that time, we didn't have much help, and then I was going
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:15.800]   back and forth running this business out in Vegas.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:22.640]   But the temptation was, when I was at Vegas, I was earning about six, seven times what
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:25.280]   I was getting paid as a pastor.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:31.840]   And as a pastor, basically I paid the mortgage and then paid for gas, and we didn't even
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:33.720]   have health insurance at that time.
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:34.880]   And that was it.
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:41.160]   So we were getting paid about $2,000 a month before tax, and that was everything.
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:43.840]   Health insurance, like everything.
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:49.200]   And then I go to Vegas and I'm making somewhere around $12,000, $15,000, $16,000 a month,
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:51.240]   as long as I'm there.
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:53.480]   So I'm struggling.
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:57.000]   I can't take care of my family like this, and if I let go of that, I can't even buy
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.600]   milk.
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:05.240]   So I'm wrestling, and knowing that when I told my mom when I first started going to
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:13.200]   ministry, she was not happy with it, not because of the calling, but because how much she suffered.
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:19.240]   And then so I knew if I told her that maybe secretly she might be happy that I'm considering,
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:25.600]   because Esther and I, we were talking, like if we move to Vegas and I ran that business,
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:29.560]   we can buy a nice house, take care of our kids, pay our bill, and then maybe we can
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:33.600]   just kind of come back on the weekends and put a young pastor there who doesn't have
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:36.240]   the finances and just support him.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.880]   So her and I, we were wrestling with this.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:42.380]   We're talking about this, and it's like, well, what choice do we have?
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:46.280]   If I don't do that, we can't survive.
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:50.440]   And so we're going back and forth, and I'm wrestling with this, and I bring this up to
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:57.960]   my mom while I'm driving, and my mom just, you know, I was expecting her to say, "Okay,
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:00.960]   you did your best," right?
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:07.360]   Because ever since I was a little kid, everybody told me that I would be rich, and I believed
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:10.040]   it.
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:15.280]   And the reason why is because ever since I was a little kid, I got into just making
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.280]   money.
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:20.880]   So in the winter, I would knock on doors and I would shovel snow, and I would make money
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:21.880]   that way.
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:24.840]   And then when fall would come around, the leaf, and this is back in the East Coast when
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:25.840]   there was a bunch of leaf.
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:26.840]   It's not like here.
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:31.080]   It's like the leaf would just pile up, like almost a foot, and then they would give me
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:33.800]   three, four dollars to rake the leaves.
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.000]   And everybody, you know, everybody would knock.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.960]   They'd say, "Hey, come, this little kid, this third grader, you know, he's going to work
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:39.960]   for us."
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:43.560]   And then when it got too hot during summer, I set up a lemonade stand.
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:48.760]   So I remember thinking early on, it's like, "Man, making money is easy."
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:52.400]   And to this day, so ever since I was young, like everybody that knew me said, "Oh, Peter
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.240]   is going to be rich.
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:55.640]   He's going to make a lot of money.
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:59.080]   He's going to be really good at business."
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.120]   And so my parents also thought that.
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.640]   My mom also thought that.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:04.980]   Like, "That's you."
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:08.880]   So when I decided to go into ministry, you know, it's like everything that I was being
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:14.880]   hyped up for, my relatives, my uncles, everybody, it's like, "What?"
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:15.880]   Right?
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:19.960]   Especially the non-Christians or nominal Christians, like, "What a waste."
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:21.360]   You know, you could have been somebody.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:25.800]   You could have made so much money, Peter, and you're going to go into ministry?
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:33.000]   And so when I finally brought that up to my mom, I assumed secretly she would be happy.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   And that would have been it.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000]   That's it.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.880]   And when I talked to Esther, Esther would have, like, I knew how much she was suffering,
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:41.480]   and she would have said, "Oh, you know, we've done everything.
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:43.260]   What could we do?"
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:48.560]   And I know I shared this story before, but it was a turning point in my life, in ministry
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:49.560]   in particular.
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:57.200]   And Esther was the first one that said, "Peter, as much as I want you to quit, you can't.
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.240]   God called you.
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:02.480]   You're not going to be able to not do this.
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.480]   And I know you."
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:04.480]   Right?
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:10.760]   "You're going to make money, buy a nice house, and take care of our family, but that calling
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:13.360]   in your life isn't going to go away.
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.460]   I know you.
[01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:16.460]   You can't quit."
[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:18.200]   So I said, "Okay, I don't have her support."
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.200]   Okay?
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:25.560]   So I talked to my mom, thinking that my mom was going to be, "Okay, you know, you've done
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.560]   everything you could.
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:28.600]   I mean, you got to take care of your kids."
[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:29.600]   Right?
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:38.240]   And my mom looked at me and she said, "Peter, I've never seen anybody do bivocational ministry
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:41.200]   and be successful.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:44.760]   You can't do this part-time.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:45.760]   You have to commit.
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:46.760]   God called you.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:47.920]   You started it.
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:51.200]   I know it's hard, but you have to keep it going."
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:54.920]   I said, "What?"
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:19:00.800]   I understood Esther pushing me back, but I did not expect that from my mom.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.320]   And that was just enough to push me over to the other end.
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:05.320]   Okay.
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:06.320]   You know?
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:12.000]   And really, to really, out of fear that I was going to regret it, I persevered during
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.960]   that period.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:21.960]   But those wise words from my wife and my mom at that time gave me enough strength to persevere.
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:27.920]   And it has been proven to me exactly.
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.280]   This is not a part-time job.
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:30.280]   You can get part-time pay.
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:31.280]   This is not a part-time job.
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:34.480]   This is not a part-time calling.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.520]   We're in spiritual battle.
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:45.660]   If the leaders in the church are distracted with civilian affairs, you cannot lead.
[01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:51.520]   If your mind is half here and half somewhere else, you cannot lead.
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:58.600]   If you have one eye toward comfort and one eye toward Christ, you cannot lead.
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:01.160]   This is not something that you can do half-hearted.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:07.000]   When he says, "We have an enemy like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour," you don't
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:16.320]   go into battle knowing that, not fully committed, not fully focused.
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:24.040]   Because the moment we take our eyes off of what's going on, we cannot lead.
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:28.120]   Paul says in 1 Corinthians 9, 19-23, "For though I am free from all men, I have made
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:32.080]   myself a slave to all so that I may win more."
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:35.520]   Paul says he has the freedom, just like any other Christian.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.520]   He's been delivered.
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:37.520]   He's no longer under the law.
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:43.760]   But he says he makes himself a slave because he's so consumed with bringing the loss to
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:48.600]   Christ, even though he says, "To the Jews, I became as a Jew."
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:54.920]   Imagine the suffocation of living under the law as a Pharisee, and he's finally delivered.
[01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:58.280]   He no longer needs to be under the law.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:04.720]   He doesn't have to obey these commandments that were created by man.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:08.860]   I was delivered from the Jews, but I became a Jew so that I may win the Jew.
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:13.100]   To those who are under the law, as under the law, though not being myself under the law,
[01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:16.640]   so that I might win those who are under the law.
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:21.000]   Do you know what that means to a Jew who was delivered?
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:27.960]   He's stepping back into the suffocating law because he's so consumed and so committed
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:32.500]   to see the lost come to Christ.
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:35.740]   To those who are without the law, as without the law, though not being without the law
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:39.620]   of God, but under the law of Christ, so that I might win those who are without the law.
[01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:42.160]   To the weak, I became weak, that I may win the weak.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:46.840]   I have become all things to all men, so that by all means to save them, I do all things
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:51.040]   for the sake of the gospel, so that I may become fellow partakers of it.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:55.880]   All things to all men, at all times.
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:59.200]   That's the calling of the leader in the church.
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:08.160]   Elders and pastors alike, we cannot lead if we are not consumed with this cause.
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:13.360]   Because we're not here to build a community of people who love one another, where we're
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:20.400]   going to raise our children together with like-minded people, play softball, win championships,
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:24.400]   take little mission trips, and we have great stories to tell one another, and that we're
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.760]   going to have generational kids.
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.960]   It's like, "Oh, that's such a great community.
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:30.960]   People love the Lord, and they're taking care of each other."
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.680]   That's not what we're here to do.
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:35.920]   Hopefully that's a byproduct.
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:40.480]   God called us to be a light in this dark world.
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:43.520]   I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:46.400]   He called the church to fight in the midst of darkness.
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:54.760]   He said, "They're going to hate you, because they hated me too."
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:23:01.680]   We cannot be leaders if all we're doing is talking.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:02.680]   Evaluate everything.
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:03.680]   Everything.
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:04.680]   I'm free, just like you.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.040]   I'm free to do whatever.
[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.200]   I can pursue things that I want.
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:13.000]   Why can't I have a business and make a lot of money on the side?
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   I'm free.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.240]   There's nothing the Bible says I can't make money.
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:23.000]   The problem is, it takes away from my heart.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.760]   It takes away from my thought.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:28.320]   I'm not consumed anymore.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:32.000]   I just do this as my job.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.600]   A leader has to be consumed as Paul is consumed.
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:44.280]   Thirdly, he must keep watch of the people of God.
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:48.320]   You know, this is an interesting word to watch, is agrupneo.
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:50.900]   And the word agrupneo means without.
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:53.920]   And you know what the word agrupneo means?
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:55.280]   Sleep.
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:59.840]   So an elder or pastor is called not to sleep.
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:03.280]   And it's like, "Oh, okay, I'm doing that already."
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:04.280]   Right?
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:07.960]   Obviously, he's not talking about physically.
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:10.320]   He's talking about spiritually.
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:14.960]   We have to be sober at all times to watch.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.680]   I remember I was talking to a young pastor who was an associate for a while, and then
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:20.400]   he became the senior pastor.
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:24.240]   And then after about a year, he started going bald and his hair started turning all white.
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:26.640]   And he was still a fairly young guy.
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:30.680]   You know, at that time, he was probably no more than 37, 38 years old, and too young
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:31.840]   to have all white hair.
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:34.380]   And I asked him, "So what happened?"
[01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:36.760]   And this is how he described it to me, what it felt like.
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:41.360]   And he said, "You know, I was kind of a, you know, I was leading some stuff on the
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:42.360]   cruise."
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:46.080]   And he said, all of a sudden, he went to the captain's lounge.
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:50.280]   And then he said, "I realized, like, I have to be awake all the time.
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:51.680]   I can't just do my job and go to sleep.
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:53.200]   I have to be awake all the time.
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:56.760]   Because if you're the captain of the cruise ship or whatever ship you're in, you have
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:00.240]   to make sure and see the waves coming, right?
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:05.640]   If you see the, you know, if you see the danger coming, you have to be the one who warns everybody
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:07.660]   to get people ready."
[01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:08.800]   And that's the way he described it.
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:11.880]   Like, "I realized, like, I need to be awake all the time."
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:15.240]   Well, that's exactly what he says.
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:21.280]   Is a leader in the church is without sleep because he is constantly watching for what
[01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.900]   purpose?
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:26.000]   The souls of the church.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:36.120]   Our primary concern is one that when you die, you are not under the judgment of Christ.
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:42.600]   You can hate us, despise us, and question our decision, but our primary concern in everything
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:48.920]   that we preach and do is make sure that you can hate us, but at the end, we're trying
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:53.800]   our best to watch over your soul so you are not under the judgment of Christ.
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:26:02.200]   Secondly, to make sure that your soul is enriched in Christ.
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:06.960]   Your soul is not dancing and rejoicing over temporary things that are also under judgment
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:08.460]   of God.
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:13.680]   That all of us learn how to rejoice and rejoicing in Christ together.
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:16.120]   And so he is the one who is constantly watching.
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:20.600]   In Corinthians 11, 28, he says, "Apart from such external things, there is a daily pressure
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:22.880]   on me of concern for all the churches.
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:25.320]   Who is weak without my being weak?
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:31.120]   Who is led into sin without my intense concern?"
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:35.280]   You know, when people come in and out of the church, you know, because of the size of the
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:40.000]   church, it seems like nothing, but if you have people who are laboring over you, praying
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.640]   over you, even though we don't have, I mean, as the church got bigger, it's harder and
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:48.080]   harder to have an interpersonal relationship with everybody at church.
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:53.440]   But we are constantly, we're constantly watching over the church.
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:56.360]   We're doing our best, right?
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:03.720]   Talking, discussing, sharing, praying, because our desire is to see you grow.
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:04.920]   Our desire is to save you.
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:09.840]   If you're a nominal Christian, you're committed to nominal Christianity, you're never going
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.680]   to feel comfortable at this church, and I'm not going to let you.
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:21.200]   I'm not going to let nominal Christians stay at this church year after year after year
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:27.040]   after year, possibly dying and falling into the judgment of Christ, and then do nothing
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:29.600]   about it other than making you feel comfortable.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:33.480]   So if you're a committed nominal Christian, you will never be comfortable at this church,
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:37.600]   because I won't let you.
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:44.680]   I'd rather have you be angry with me, and wake up and realize what the Bible says, and
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:50.960]   be committed to the truth, than to have a room filled with people who are enjoying life
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:59.880]   and doing everything that the world does, and then realize after death that they're
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:04.480]   on the wrong side of the judgment of Christ.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:09.360]   Let me give you the final thing, why this is such a high calling.
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:13.520]   He says, "To give an account before God."
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:16.160]   There's a separate judgment for leaders.
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:21.440]   James chapter 3, 1-2, "Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, knowing that
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:25.320]   as such we will incur stricter judgment.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:26.560]   For we all stumble in many ways.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:30.040]   If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man and able to brighten the
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.800]   whole body as well."
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:35.160]   I remember a pastor described this as having two separate lines.
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:38.840]   You have a line from the people who are not leaders, and then you have the line of the
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:44.200]   leaders, and the leaders will incur stricter judgment.
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:49.280]   We are told in the Scripture not to lay hands hastily.
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:54.160]   In 1 Timothy 5, 19-25, it says, "Do not receive an accusation against an elder, except on
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:57.040]   the basis of two or three witnesses."
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:01.840]   Have you noticed that when there's church discipline for a regular church congregation,
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:04.720]   there's three steps?
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:09.120]   They sin, and then you confront them, and then they won't repent.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:12.880]   Then you take a brother with you, or a sister, and then you try to say, "You know what?
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:15.920]   This is something that you need to repent of," and they refuse.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:20.080]   Then the third step is to take it to the church, and if they won't refuse, then he says, "To
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:21.080]   treat them like an unbeliever."
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:22.520]   There's three steps.
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.720]   The three steps is to bring them to repentance, to restore them.
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:27.160]   It's not to shame them ultimately.
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:29.600]   It's to bring them to restore them.
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:35.000]   But when it comes to leadership, it says, "Don't even get to step one, unless there's
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000]   an agreement.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.400]   Don't bring an accusation unless there's two or three witnesses."
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:43.800]   And so two or three, right?
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:45.880]   You can be, you can say it was a two or three.
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:49.040]   I mean, our church has anywhere between 800 and 900 people.
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:51.200]   I'm sure there's two or three, right?
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:55.840]   If somebody has something against me, I'm sure you can fight two or three, right?
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:03.880]   Like just in my family, I have me, and I could convince my wife pretty easily, right?
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:06.160]   And then get one of my children to support me.
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:10.240]   Then we can bring down any leader.
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:11.900]   Is that what he means?
[01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:12.900]   Of course not.
[01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:15.520]   He's saying, "Is there a consensus?
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:20.640]   Is there an agreement in the congregation that that person should not be a leader?"
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:22.640]   Because he's not above reproach.
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:24.620]   He's pugnacious.
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:25.620]   Whatever it may be, he's disqualified.
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:30.120]   His character doesn't match up to the calling of an elder.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:35.440]   And so we cannot preach, submit, and obey because of that leader, because we don't trust
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:36.840]   the leadership because of that.
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:37.840]   It weakens the church.
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:41.320]   So, first, he says, "Do not bring an accusation against an elder unless there's two or three
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:42.320]   witnesses."
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:50.720]   But if there are two or three witnesses, he says, "Those who continue to sin, rebuke in
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:56.040]   the presence of all so that rest also will be fearful of sinning."
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:31:02.120]   So, if there is a consensus, it says to rebuke him publicly.
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:03.400]   There's no step two.
[01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:04.960]   It goes from, "There's a consensus.
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:05.960]   He's wrong."
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.800]   He said, "Remove him."
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:11.780]   Because that person who's in that position that shouldn't be there, and there's a consensus
[01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:17.320]   in the church that we cannot submit to this leader because of his moral and character
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:22.580]   failing, he must be removed because it will hurt the church.
[01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:28.280]   If you bring an accusation that doesn't stick, then you've done harm, not only to him, but
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:29.280]   to the church.
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:33.280]   It says, "Do not entertain it unless it's true, unless there is a consensus."
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:38.620]   But if there is a consensus, you would be equally wrong to sweep that under the rug
[01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:41.860]   and say, "We're just being gracious."
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:47.840]   Because now you're throwing the church, the weightiness of the church, and you're treating
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:50.620]   it unholy, that which is holy.
[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:56.140]   He says, it goes on, turn 22, "Do not lay hands upon anyone too hastily."
[01:31:56.140 --> 01:32:00.100]   And he's talking about ordaining, bringing people into leadership, "And thereby share
[01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:03.320]   responsibility for the sins of others."
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:09.000]   So when we ordain people as an elder or as a pastor in the church, and you say, "Yeah,
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000]   I just want to be gracious."
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.560]   I go, "Who doesn't make mistakes?"
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:18.540]   Everybody is gracious until you're bothered.
[01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:21.800]   We all practice grace as long as it's not personal.
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:27.400]   Then as soon as it becomes personal, judgment.
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:29.380]   How can that guy be in leadership?
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:31.560]   You ordained him.
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:33.320]   Why were you okay when it wasn't personal?
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:34.320]   And then all of a sudden it's personal.
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:36.740]   It's like, "How did the church do this?"
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:41.200]   He says right off the bat, "Do not ordain hastily."
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:46.760]   He who ordains hastily, when that person sins, he says, "You are also guilty of his sins
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:51.780]   because you took lightly the leadership of the church."
[01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:57.120]   Some sins are evident going before them to judgment, and their sins follow after.
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:02.360]   Likewise, also, deeds that are good are quite evident, and those which are otherwise cannot
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:03.360]   be concealed.
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:08.200]   Okay, so let me wrap it up right here.
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:09.200]   This was easy for you.
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:10.200]   Okay?
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:14.280]   So the only people who are squirming here are the pastors and elders today.
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:17.600]   Your turn will come next week.
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:23.840]   The reason why I wanted to spend at least one sermon, one part, before we get to the
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:30.320]   second part of calling the congregation to obey and submit to the leadership of the church,
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:34.880]   is not because we're more honorable, that we've been separated, and because of this
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:35.880]   title.
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:40.160]   It's because of what we've been called to do.
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:47.680]   And we cannot do it, and we can't do it well without the cooperation of the church.
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:54.320]   And so submitting to the eldership is not submitting to the people.
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:58.480]   If there's an elder or a leader, it starts to get to his head, and he starts having an
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:02.420]   ego, and he begins to think that I must be good, right?
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:06.920]   And you begin to see that pride welling up in that individual, right?
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:10.820]   That's the beginning of their fall.
[01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:16.180]   That's dangerous because I've been in, again, ministry long enough to know that before anything
[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:19.080]   else happened, pride creeps in.
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:25.040]   And then that pride allows all these other sins to come in.
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:32.160]   But the reason why the church, and the reason why that passage is in there, is because of
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:35.680]   the high calling of leaders.
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:40.600]   And so first and foremost, our leadership has to take this seriously.
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:43.740]   We cannot be divided.
[01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:46.280]   We have to be committed.
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:52.780]   We have to make sure that we're sober, that we're watching, that we are not compromised.
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:59.000]   And second, you need to help us have a high standard of leadership, not simply because,
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.680]   you know, like, "Oh, they're skilled.
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.240]   We need more leaders, and we have so many people.
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:03.720]   How come we're not establishing that?"
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:08.160]   It's like, yes, we would like to have 30 elders, right?
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:12.400]   I mean, we could use all the help, but we want to be careful.
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:17.040]   We want to keep the standard that the Scripture teaches us to the best of our ability so that
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:21.280]   we do not compromise the integrity of the church and that Christ is exalted in the midst
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:23.460]   of this.
[01:35:23.460 --> 01:35:24.460]   So pray for us.
[01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:30.520]   And that's going to be part of next week's sermon, that hopefully, including myself and
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:36.920]   the elders and the pastors, are shaking in our boots, right, that we examine our lives,
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:42.720]   our hearts carefully, knowing the high calling that we've been called to.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:48.080]   And I'll be honest with you, this high calling of pastoral ministry really didn't hit me
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:49.080]   until I was ordained.
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:53.040]   You know, it's like, "Okay, that's something you're supposed to do.
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:55.040]   You have to get ordained because you're going to have to full-time ministry."
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:59.480]   But I remember when the pastors, there was about eight or nine of them who put their
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:03.960]   hands on me, and they were praying, and they were praying in Korean, and I didn't understand
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:06.720]   half of what they were saying.
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:13.600]   But I remember the gravity of them laying their hands on me and understanding what it
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:16.680]   is that I've been called to do, and it broke me.
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:24.600]   Like, this is more than any human being can handle by his own strength.
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:30.200]   And so I pray and hope that you guys would lift up our leadership in that manner, knowing
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:37.160]   that we are weak men in need of your grace, so that our church that we are building, right,
[01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:41.600]   to be a light would start with our leadership.
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:46.440]   Join me in prayer.
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:53.560]   Heavenly Father, you know our weaknesses.
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:59.960]   You know our tendency, Lord God, to be worried about our future, our children.
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:06.160]   You know, Father God, our hearts, how easily it can be compromised, how we fall into temptation,
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:08.720]   Lord God.
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:18.040]   Help us, Lord, to remember the height from which we have fallen, that we may repent and
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:21.820]   redo the things that you called us to do.
[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:25.040]   Help us as leaders, Lord God, as we are weak men.
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:29.040]   And when you warned us and encouraged us that if you do not abide in me, you cannot bear
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:31.400]   any fruit.
[01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:34.760]   Teach us, Lord God, to abide in you.
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:42.080]   Help us, Lord God, day to day, this week, to remember the high calling of leadership,
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:48.760]   that you will prepare our hearts, Lord God, for what you plan to do with this church.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:55.560]   Make grace, righteousness, and holiness be exalted, Lord God, in this church in the name
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:56.560]   of Christ.
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:57.560]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:58.560]   Amen.
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:01.560]   Would you all stand up with me for the closing praise?
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:21.680]   Oh, sovereign God, oh, matchless King, the saints adore, the angels sing, and fall before
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:28.680]   the throne of grace.
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:39.680]   To you belongs the highest praise.
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:43.680]   These sufferings, this passing time, under your wings I will abide.
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:51.680]   And every enemy shall flee.
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:39:02.680]   You are my hope and victory.
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:03.680]   Praise the Father, praise the Son.
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:04.680]   Praise the Spirit, three in one.
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:05.680]   Clothed in power and in grace.
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:06.680]   The name of Christ, the name of Christ.
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:30.680]   To the valley for my soul, thy great descent has made me whole.
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:37.680]   Your word and heart has built the tomb.
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:42.680]   Countess like water ever flows.
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:48.680]   Praise the Father, praise the Son.
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:53.680]   Praise the Spirit, three in one.
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:40:00.680]   Clothed in power and in grace.
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:11.680]   The name of Christ, the name of Christ.
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:35.680]   To the valley for my soul, thy great descent has made me whole.
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:55.680]   Yours is the power, yours is the glory forever.
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:41:19.680]   Praise the Father, praise the Son.
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:25.680]   Praise the Spirit, three in one.
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:30.680]   Clothed in power and in grace.
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:36.680]   The name of all, all other names.
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:43.680]   The name of all, all other names.
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:47.680]   >> Let's pray.
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:54.680]   Father, as you've been merciful to us all these years, Lord, we don't know what's coming ahead of us.
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:42:02.680]   But we pray, Father God, as the author of Hebrews has constantly been encouraging us to be anchored in Christ.
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:06.680]   We pray first and foremost for our leadership.
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:15.680]   Help us, Lord God, each day to remain sober, to stay awake and watch, to be prayerful, to be in your word, Lord God.
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:18.680]   To preach in season and out of season.
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:24.680]   That we may be proper and correct and righteous ambassadors of Christ.
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:29.680]   That we may simply represent who you are in season and out of season.
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:34.680]   Help us, Lord God, to live day to day with weightiness of this calling.
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:39.680]   That we would desire more than anything else, Lord God, to see Christ exalted.
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:46.680]   To see sinners, Lord, confess their love for you, to be saved.
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:53.680]   Nominal Christians, Lord God, who lived all their lives, Lord God, with their own making of who you are.
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:58.680]   That those paradigms would be shattered, Lord, by your word.
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:03.680]   That you would build a true church that will worship you in spirit and in truth.
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:07.680]   And as you've promised that the gates of Hades would not be able to prevail against it.
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:11.680]   Help us to be the church that you've called us to be.
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:18.680]   Especially as the world, Lord God, is plunging toward immorality.
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:21.680]   That our love would not grow cold.
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:26.680]   But that we would have greater revival, greater urgency, Lord God, to come before you.
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:29.680]   To help us, Lord, especially as leaders.
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:31.680]   To be desperate, Father God.
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:34.680]   To be engaged in this battle with spiritual warfare.
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:37.680]   That you would build this church for the sake of your name and your glory.
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:39.680]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:44.680]   God sent his Son
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:49.680]   They called him Jesus
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:54.680]   He came to love
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:59.680]   He left for good
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:04.680]   He lived and died
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:09.680]   To buy my pardon
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:15.680]   An empty grave is there to prove
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:20.680]   My Savior lives
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:25.680]   Because he lives
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:30.680]   I can face tomorrow
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:35.680]   Because he lives
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:40.680]   Fear is gone
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:45.680]   Because I know
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:50.680]   He holds the future
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:55.680]   And life is worth the living
[01:44:55.680 --> 01:45:00.680]   Just because he lives
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:03.680]   Amen.
