[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   So, let me read for us here, it says, "Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.600]   ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.680]   God.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.880]   Make room for us in your hearts.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.280]   We wronged no one, we corrupted no one, we took advantage of no one.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.840]   I do not speak to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in our hearts to
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.240]   die together and to live together.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.960]   Great is my confidence in you.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.760]   Great is my boasting on your behalf.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.440]   I am filled with comfort.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.640]   I am overflowing with joy in all your affliction.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.560]   For even when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted on
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.440]   every side, conflicts without, fears within.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.800]   But God, who comforts the depressed, comforted us by the coming of Titus.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.800]   And not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.600]   As he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.600]   more."
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.400]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.320]   God, we do ask for your spirit's work.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.280]   Each time on the weekend, each time we open your word, each time we're exposed to your
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.880]   truth, I pray, Lord, that on every level, both from our mind and the way that we think,
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:29.600]   both on the level of our heart's desires, our will, and also on the level of our action
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.280]   and how we apply things.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.720]   God, would you do your work, the spiritual work of causing your word to impact us and
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.920]   be evident in our lives.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.880]   Particularly today as we think through this topic of genuine repentance, this topic of
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.740]   the heart of Apostle Paul, I ask, Father, that you give us great insight.
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.760]   We thank you it's in Christ and we pray.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.760]   Amen.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.040]   Okay.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.880]   As you look at that passage that we just read together, there's probably a lot of initial
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.500]   sentiments.
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.320]   Apostle Paul speaking in very sentimental terms, emotional terms, very loving terms,
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.320]   mentioning how he wants them to make room for them in their heart, how he's not speaking
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.640]   to condemn, how he wants to be together with them essentially rejoicing over them, essentially
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.760]   saying how much he loves them.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:30.200]   Now as we think about this, there's an interesting statement he makes that he wrote a letter
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.520]   to them that was hard to accept.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.480]   He wrote a letter to them that caused them sorrow.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.920]   And what's really interesting about that is he says, "At one moment, I regretted it."
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.300]   What gives?
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.120]   What I'd like to do is help us understand and drop down into a kind of point where we
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.320]   can sympathize with Apostle Paul and understand where he's coming from and why he would write
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.720]   this way.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.320]   And that's why in order to do that, my introduction is going to be really long.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:08.800]   The very first passage I want you guys to turn to is, oh sorry, you know, we're already
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   there.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.040]   Just take a look at verses five through eight.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.140]   "Flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted on every side, conflicts without, fears within,
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.660]   but God who comforts the depressed comforted us."
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.640]   So as you take a moment to think about that, it is very, very fair for us to conclude,
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.860]   Apostle Paul has been through incredible difficulties, yes?
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.440]   He's been through a lot.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.680]   He describes conflicts and pressures externally.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.960]   He describes a kind of tumultuous insides of fear, uncertainty, and he basically says,
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.200]   "There has been no rest for us."
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.200]   Okay?
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.600]   And as we think about that, we go to the very beginning.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.780]   So now, I'll turn to chapter one, 2 Corinthians chapter one, and I believe we can put that
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.640]   up there too, starting from verse eight through ten.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.860]   And the way that Apostle Paul describes his affliction is he says it was abundant.
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.860]   Okay?
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.540]   Part of the reason why 2 Corinthians begins with Apostle Paul saying that there was lots
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.380]   and abundant comfort for me is because there was so much affliction and pain.
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.520]   Let's read 2 Corinthians chapter one, verse eight through ten says, "For we do not want
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.680]   you to be unaware, brethren, of our affliction which came to us in Asia."
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:27.020]   So he wants the church to know how much he suffered, and he describes it by saying, "The
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.340]   burden was excessive beyond our strength so that we despaired even of life.
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.760]   Indeed, we had the sentence of death within ourselves so that we would not trust in ourselves
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.040]   but in God who raises the dead.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.960]   He delivered us from so great a peril of death and will deliver us.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.680]   He on whom we have set our hope and he will yet deliver us."
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.840]   As you hear his description, I wanted all of us to start thinking about and perceiving
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.500]   and picturing what kind of suffering is he talking about.
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.440]   He is talking about a kind of suffering where the burden is excessive and it is beyond what
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.040]   he believes he can handle.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.840]   And I started thinking, "What kind of hardships have I experienced?"
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.640]   There were moments when, you know, just again, some of the more tangible, difficult moments
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.720]   is just having a little infant baby at home, right?
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.800]   You're tired, you feel like a zombie and the kid's crying in your face and you start thinking,
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.080]   "I can't do this," right?
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.300]   You start having moments and statements like that come out of you, half joking, the other
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.480]   half is like, "For real, this is too hard," right?
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.480]   I don't know why I'm holding the baby like this.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.440]   Hold the baby like this, okay.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.760]   On the flip side, you guys have all had moments probably when you were at your end in terms
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.080]   of energy.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.280]   You had projects due, you had work due, you had people who are depending on you, you have
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.080]   family depending on you.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.640]   There were many moments in ministry where I just, at the end of the day, it's like three
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.080]   in the morning, I'm dead tired, I have to get stuff done and I started thinking, "I've
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.320]   got no more left," right?
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.840]   And I started using funny voices to complain and et cetera, et cetera.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.800]   I'm sure you have all experienced moments when you are really, really tired.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.800]   Yes?
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.480]   You don't have to raise your hand, I'm just going to assume so.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.640]   As I started thinking about that, I started thinking, "Can that be a way of me sympathizing
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.640]   with Apostle Paul?"
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:27.440]   And I started, "Probably not," because he's talking about like burden beyond like bearing,
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.840]   like being able to do it.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:35.520]   And I recall to me my parents, my parents who were born in Korea a long time ago and
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:42.880]   went through as a teenager, the war generation, hungry, lost, losing their parents, immigrating
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.880]   to the US.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.720]   And one of the memories that I distinctly remember that has been etched in my mind was
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.120]   when I was in fifth grade, my parents worked at the swap meet.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.760]   I'm not sure if you guys have ever even heard of it now, they're very limited.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.440]   Down in San Diego, there's a big one right on their San Diego sports arena.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.080]   That was some of the hardest work they've done.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.480]   They'd have to get up at 4.30 in the morning, drive to the storage, get their truck, pull
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.040]   out all the boxes, pull out the pipes, lay it on the asphalt.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.640]   It's cold and dark out there.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.880]   They set up the tent, they take out the boxes, they were selling T-shirts and wallets.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.520]   Literally each shirt was like two bucks.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.600]   They put it out there, they work all day.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.320]   You're under a canopy tarp, it's hot, it's very, very exhausting.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.880]   They had no time to even go to the restroom.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.360]   I was in the fifth grade and I was sitting here thinking I'd be a good son.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.640]   They're like, "You can go, I'll just watch the register."
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.520]   They're like, "Ha ha, thanks but no thanks."
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.600]   How can they entrust me with that stuff with me and my brother there?
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.800]   And then the other part of it is that they just kept going and going and going until
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.280]   the thing closed at five.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.280]   At which point, they're exhausted but they have to put the clothes back in the box, put
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.160]   it in the truck, take the canopy down, take the pipes, they're all metal pipes, put it
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.160]   in the truck.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.640]   And I remember my parents, after having done all that, paid their workers, they're gone.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.080]   It's like six at night.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.720]   They walk to the front of the truck, they go both sit inside and I just started seeing
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.440]   them cry because they were so tired.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.320]   And here's me just messing around with the boxes and the pigeons that are flying around
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.240]   over at the swap meet, looking at my parents like, "What's going on?"
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.680]   And I just realized they are at their wit's end.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.640]   And I remember thinking as a young kid, it was my first moment where I had this very
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.720]   kind of worldly ambition and I said, "I'm going to work so hard.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.360]   I'm never going to see my parents like this."
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.160]   I felt that.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.960]   And I'm sure for your own respective lives, you guys have had hardships.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.360]   There are various people in your life, they have had hardships.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.600]   Where we are at our own strength's end.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.920]   And the things that are coming at us, whether it be external or internal, it doesn't care
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.200]   whether you can handle it or not, it's going to happen.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.120]   And I wonder, can we sympathize with Apostle Paul when he says, "I have had pretty much
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:07.160]   the peril of death on me all day long."
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:13.240]   And then I realized, oh goodness, although I can imagine to some degree and appreciate
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.520]   the kind of suffering and hardships he went through, this is still very different.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.960]   Yes?
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.680]   This is still very different.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.680]   I can appreciate the kind of hardships that my parents have gone through, but what Apostle
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:31.920]   Paul is going through is very different because he says, "I literally despaired of life."
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:37.000]   Which means that in the moment he was looking at his current circumstances and saying, "I'm
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.680]   pretty much going to die."
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.960]   And there is no hope of escape.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.120]   He was on the cliff's edge all the time.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.120]   That's quite incredible.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.120]   What are we supposed to think about that?
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:56.440]   Now there's other passages that continue to expand on us dropping down into Apostle Paul's
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.840]   experience and appreciating the kind of suffering he went through.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.760]   Second Corinthians chapter 4, verse 8 through 12.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.920]   Second Corinthians chapter 4, verse 8 through 12.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:12.440]   Apostle Paul says this, "We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed, perplexed,
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:18.320]   but not despairing, persecuted, but not forsaken, struck down, but not destroyed, always caring
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.440]   about in the body the dying of Jesus."
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:28.840]   So essentially what I just said, he repeated in another form, he was literally at the edge.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:34.400]   He's struck down, he's perplexed, he's pushed to his limits, he's pretty much at the edge.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.320]   And then he says, "So that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body."
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:45.320]   So we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for Jesus' sake.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:50.480]   So that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh, so death works in us
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.360]   but life in you.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:57.400]   Verse 15, "For all things are for your sakes, so that the grace which is spreading to more
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:04.000]   and more people may cause the giving of things to abound to the glory of God."
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.600]   I think about this and I'm sitting here thinking, "Okay, what is there to learn about the kind
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.980]   of hardships that Apostle Paul went through and how he went through it?"
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:20.880]   What I realized is quite profound and amazing is that for people who are in survival mode,
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.960]   yes, they're going to work hard.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.600]   If you've come from, let's say, you've been through recession, you've been through the
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.920]   pits, maybe you had physical ailment, maybe you're an immigrant, maybe you had certain
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:36.760]   life experiences that put you in a kind of circumstance where you feel like, "I am in
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.680]   survival mode," then it makes sense.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.600]   You're going to work hard, you're going to sacrifice.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.320]   We talk about blood and sweat and tears, right?
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.000]   But we do that because why?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.440]   Because I want to survive.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.880]   Apostle Paul says very clearly, "I am being delivered to death for first the sake of my
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.840]   Lord and then for you."
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.360]   Who thinks like that?
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.960]   If it's not about your survival, why would you go through all those hardships and suffering?
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.680]   That's my question.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.400]   And then I think, "Okay, it was good for my mind to go to my parents."
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.840]   Why?
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.040]   Because parents do that.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.640]   They will suffer.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.840]   They will sacrifice.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.880]   I always laugh and make fun of my parents sometimes.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.760]   I'm like, "Why are you so cheap?
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.160]   Just throw away the Ziploc bag.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.160]   You don't have to wash it, right?
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.160]   It's like a penny."
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.280]   It's like, "No, I'm not throwing away that Ziploc bag."
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:34.840]   But when it comes to your kids, they're dropping money for everything, sporting, snacks, food,
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.840]   games, anything.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.840]   They just drop whatever, tuition.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.320]   They're just dropping money like crazy, like insurance, car.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.680]   They don't even think twice.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.720]   It's like, "For the kids, anything.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.560]   For me, I'm not throwing away the Ziploc bag."
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.120]   I always laughed at that because at my house back when I was a kid, we would have Ziploc
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.040]   bags drying on the various things.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.160]   It's like a distinct image in my head.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.200]   And I think it's appropriate.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:07.960]   Apostle Paul is thinking like a parent over the entire church.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.440]   Whoa.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.040]   Yes?
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.080]   Apostle Paul is thinking like a parent over the entire church.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:22.640]   And he says, "I am being delivered to death for you, all things for your sake, so that
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.360]   you would give things to God."
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.000]   Apostle Paul is thinking that his suffering is more not just simply for his own survival.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.740]   His suffering is for his children.
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.920]   And that's exactly what he says.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.120]   Second Corinthians chapter 12, verse 14 through 16.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.920]   Chapter 12, verse 14 through 16, he says, "Here, for this third time, I am ready to
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.420]   come to you.
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:49.120]   And I will not be burdened to you, for I do not seek what's yours, but you."
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.280]   Oh, man, this book is so intimate.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.600]   I don't want your stuff.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.000]   I want you.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Why?
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.280]   Because children are not responsible to save up for their parents, but parents for their
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.280]   children.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.600]   And here's Apostle Paul alluding to this universal principle that everybody already
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.280]   accepts, that children do not save for parents, but parents save for children.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.280]   Why?
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.800]   Because he sees himself exactly in that relationship to the church.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.280]   You are my spiritual children.
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.480]   I don't want your stuff.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.760]   Do you see what I'm doing?
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.840]   I want you.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:29.600]   Verse 15, "I will most gladly spend and be expended for your souls.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.320]   If I love you more, am I to be loved less?
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.960]   But be that it is may, I did not burden you myself.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.400]   Nevertheless, crafty fellow that I am, I took you in by deceit."
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.080]   He's being sarcastic there.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.160]   And I hope you guys already start to see the scenery of what's going on.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.840]   He's loving them like parents.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.920]   He's loving them like good mom and dad would.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.920]   And every time he loves them, they start questioning, "What are you doing?"
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.920]   And he's being sarcastic.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.360]   Do you think I'm trying to bribe you?
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.200]   You think I'm trying to dupe you into loving me back to get your stuff from you, like your
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.440]   donations and your tithes?
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.480]   I want you to start imagining from an Apostle Paul's perspective.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.000]   He loves them now like his own precious children.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.720]   And here they are with a suspicious eye like, "What are you doing?
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.720]   Why do you want our money?"
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.720]   Right?
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.280]   "Why are you speaking to us that way?"
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:24.800]   Now, another passage that talks about the exact same idea is chapter 6, verse 3 through
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.800]   13.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.040]   2 Corinthians chapter 6, verse 3 through 13.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.240]   He says this, "Giving no cause for offense in anything so that the ministry will not
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.960]   be discredited," okay?
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:40.440]   He has to uphold the work that God has ordained him to do.
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.280]   He has work that God has designed him to do.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.640]   And he says, "But in everything, commending ourselves as servants of God in much endurance."
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:53.240]   Look at this long list of afflictions, hardships, distressions, beatings, imprisonments, tumults,
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.720]   in labors, sleeplessness, in hunger, in impurity, in knowledge, and patience, and kindness,
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:03.760]   in Holy Spirit, in genuine love, in the word of truth, in the power of God, by the weapons
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.220]   of righteousness for the right hand and the left, by glory and dishonor, by evil report
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:13.880]   and good report, regarded as deceivers and yet true, as unknown yet well-known, as dying
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.720]   yet behold, we live, as punished yet not put to death, as sorrowful yet always rejoicing,
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.920]   as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing yet possessing all things.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.760]   Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.520]   Your heart is open wide.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:33.280]   You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in your own affections.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.520]   Now in a like exchange, I speak as to what?
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.640]   Children, open wide to us also.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:47.520]   And I took a moment to think about, "Oh, goodness, how can I relate and appreciate
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.160]   what Apostle Paul is doing?"
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:55.360]   And the picture of the parents is right on, but think about mature parents who have children,
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.120]   who have gained independence, gone off to college, working the dunce.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.160]   I remember certain times when my parents would nag me, "How come you don't go?"
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.160]   Okay?
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:11.280]   For those of you who have more older children who are now off out of your house, you know,
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.440]   there may be times when you're like, "God, they don't even think of us."
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.560]   I wonder if Apostle Paul has that sentiment.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:26.880]   My house, the doors are wide open to you, but is your door open for me?
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.320]   In you living, I get it, you have your work, you have your school, you have your own family
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.600]   now probably, you have your own priorities, but is there any space for me there?
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.400]   Have you made any room for me?
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   Right?
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.400]   And for parents who are a bit older, I want to commend you.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.120]   That is a very vulnerable situation.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.520]   For those of you guys who have older parents, I hope you understand.
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.400]   Some parents complain like, "How come you don't make time for me?"
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:57.320]   Yes, it sounds like nagging, but I want you to understand how vulnerable of a position
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:02.520]   that is for a much more older, mature individual to look to their children and say, "Can you
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.240]   include me?"
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.800]   Some of us aren't even willing to do that with their own friends.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.480]   It's too hard to ask like, "Hey, can you invite me next time when you hang out?"
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.720]   It's too humbling to ask that.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:22.400]   But for older parents to ask to their own kids, "Can you make room for me?"
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:29.440]   I want you to understand and feel perhaps the heartbrokenness and the affections that
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.600]   Apostle Paul is going through.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.640]   Does that make sense?
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.880]   He has to ask, "Would you open wide your heart?"
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:42.420]   I'm not sure if any of us have ever talked like that to another individual.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.520]   Perhaps not even like romantic relationships.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:49.840]   I mean, when was the last time a young man said to a young girl, "My heart's open.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.680]   Can you make big space for me?
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.240]   Can you open your heart?"
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.280]   Nobody really talks like that, right?
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:03.600]   Apostle Paul is so open because he sees the whole church as his spiritual children.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.720]   And I hope you're being inspired by this.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:12.320]   We are all called to be in loving Christian ministry to one another.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:17.440]   And to what degree can we express this kind of loving affection and adoration?
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.720]   And I say here, the reason why I'm sharing with you this because I'm a pastor, right?
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.440]   This is like rebuking me like crazy.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.320]   And part of it is, yeah, like I just see everybody as my friends.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:32.120]   And the great thing is I am at a church where I'm treated extremely well.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.480]   Can I just confess that?
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.720]   I'm treated super duper well at our church.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.480]   I'm just praising God and thankful for that.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.900]   I'm just saying.
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:41.900]   You guys get it, right?
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:49.080]   It's hard for me to empathize with Apostle Paul, but we have to.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:56.800]   He says, "I wrote a hard letter to you, and I wrote it in tears, and I was in regret."
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:02.060]   And for us to appreciate that, we have to think from his perspective.
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:08.020]   But it gets worse because I want you to imagine.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:15.640]   He says in that passage, chapter 6 right here, verse 8, that there is evil report and good
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.640]   report.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.180]   What does that mean?
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.560]   That means Apostle Paul was loving this church like a parent, like a father, and some people
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.900]   regarded him as a deceiver.
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.640]   They attacked his character.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.360]   And I started thinking like, "Whoa, I want to imagine that too.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.920]   Like what would that be like?
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:41.720]   Go back to my scenery that I gave to you when me as a fifth grader was looking at my parents
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:49.400]   crying in front of their truck because they were so tired they couldn't drive home.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.760]   And then imagine me sitting there thinking, "What's going on?
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.520]   Why are they crying?"
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.800]   And rather than having the good son's heart and thinking, "Oh, goodness, I want to help
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:03.560]   you," imagine if I had a wicked heart and I turned and I said, "Why are you crying?
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.300]   Why are you doing this?
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.360]   Why are you getting up at four in the morning, going home at seven at night, and then crying
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.360]   over it?
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.080]   All you care about is money.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.500]   That's why you're crying.
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.960]   All you care about is success.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.540]   I'm leaving."
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.560]   Can you imagine if I did that?
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.940]   What pains Apostle Paul would feel in his heart?
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:30.280]   And I started thinking, I just started imagining like, "What would I feel like if Yoshi did
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.280]   that to me?"
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.280]   And I was like, "Oh, I can't even think of it, right?
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.280]   How dare you?"
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.200]   You know, like, it would be crazy, right?
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.320]   I didn't even want to think about it.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.360]   But that's what he's saying he's been through.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.120]   The buildup from chapter one through chapter seven, Apostle Paul has been through loving
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:54.920]   his church, loving his church like a parent, and they regard him as a deceiver, and they
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.240]   question his intent.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.480]   Wow.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.720]   Talk about ouch, right?
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:07.360]   He says very clearly, "Listen, I have had external pains, but there's no pain like getting
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.360]   hurt by my own children."
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.880]   Take a look at this, 2 Corinthians 11, verse 23 to 31.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:18.400]   This is one of the more famous lists of Apostle Paul's difficulties and pains that he's been
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.480]   through.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:26.960]   He says this starting from verse 23, "Are they servants of Christ?
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.240]   I speak as if insane.
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:35.240]   I'm more so, in far more labors and far more imprisonments, beaten times without number,
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.840]   often in danger of death.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.800]   Five times I received the Jews' 39 lashes.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.480]   Three times I was beaten with rods.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.480]   Once I was stoned.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.480]   Three times I was shipwrecked.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.480]   A night and a day I have spent in the deep.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.200]   I have been on frequent journeys and dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.240]   from my countrymen, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness,
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.600]   dangers in the sea, dangers among false brethren.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:03.240]   I have been in labor and hardship through my sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst,
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.640]   often without food and cold exposure.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:10.680]   Apart from such external things, there is daily pressure on me of concern for all the
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.680]   churches.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.400]   Who is weak without my being weak?
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.520]   Who is led into sin without my intense concern?
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.120]   If I have to boast, I will boast of what pertains to my weakness.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:27.400]   The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, He who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying."
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.840]   I want you to think about that for a moment.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:36.400]   He says just right there, "I have been through so much and I want you to know it."
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.900]   Because that's reality.
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.400]   He's not bragging.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.520]   He's not sitting there doing, "I'm going to give you a testimony, but it's going to be
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.800]   a bragamony.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.800]   Here it is.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.800]   Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.800]   What's up now?"
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:47.800]   Right?
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.800]   That's not what He's doing.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:55.560]   He's saying, "I want you to understand this degree of pain I have.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:03.720]   I have all the externals, but apart from all this, more than all this, I have this concern
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.360]   for you that burdens my soul."
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.840]   And He says, "Who is weak without me being weak?
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.280]   Who is led into sin without my intense concern?
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.720]   If I have to boast, I boast of what pertains to my weakness."
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.520]   What weakness is He talking about?
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.280]   What weakness?
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.800]   Is He weaker than them, the church?
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.720]   Is He talking about a kind of weakness where like, "Yeah, I've got to boast of my weakness
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.120]   because Christ is more.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.760]   So my weakness is I can't get up to do Bible study."
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.160]   He's not talking about that kind of weakness.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.280]   My weakness is I'm falling to sexual immorality and it's hard to fight temptation.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.760]   He's not talking about that kind of weakness.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.520]   What kind of weakness is He boasting?
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:50.080]   What's the central point in His suffering that He's saying, "This is where my heart
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.080]   is."
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.560]   And it's exactly what I said to you earlier.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:02.440]   His weakness is synonymous with a vulnerable heart of love.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:09.320]   Brothers and sisters, He has made Himself weak to feel the pain of loving the church.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.840]   And this is where the gospel shines.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:17.900]   I believe Apostle Paul has met, truly, truly met the Lord Jesus, right?
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:26.160]   Who is it that has initiated and set the ultimate, ultimate example of being so vulnerable, carrying
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.400]   all the risk?
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.240]   Loving sinful man is risky business.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.680]   It threatens your well-being.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:37.000]   It threatens your comfort and your sanity.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.900]   What's more, it threatens you with the great, great heartache of being betrayed.
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:50.040]   If you notice, Apostle Paul says right at the beginning of that, right at the beginning
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.200]   of that, "Are they servants of Christ?"
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.360]   What is he talking about?
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.800]   At the beginning of chapter 11, Apostle Paul realizes, and Apostle Paul comments on and
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:05.160]   instructs them, "You have these false teachers who are entering your fold.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.760]   How is it that you're turning to them already?"
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:14.680]   On a human level, do you think Apostle Paul felt betrayed?
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.780]   There is a certain virtue called loyalty.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.540]   He sacrificed, he worked.
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:25.440]   He says he works day and night, not reserving anything, not his own well-being, not his
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:30.140]   own money, not his own life.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:34.940]   After two years of ministering with them, after two years of instruction, loving, caring
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:40.780]   for them, nurturing them, they say, "I don't know about you.
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:45.140]   I doubt whether you're really doing this out of good intentions.
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.060]   I think I'll go with them."
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.420]   The kind of pain Apostle Paul felt was deep.
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.460]   It was so deep.
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:59.060]   And so, I want you to understand this.
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:00.060]   Why?
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:04.920]   Because for us to appreciate 2 Corinthians chapter 7, verse 1 through 7, where he says
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:10.900]   to them, "Make room for us in your hearts," where he says to them how he does not speak,
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:15.820]   even though he's speaking harshly, strongly, firmly in correction, he's not speaking to
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:17.540]   condemn, is he?
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.100]   But rather, he is desiring to love them.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.240]   His desire to speak truth to them.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.740]   He wants absolutely what's best for them.
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:30.340]   For us to appreciate that, we have to follow the trail.
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:35.180]   And so, at this point right now, now I've finished my introduction.
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.340]   We're going now into the main first point.
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.060]   And the first point is this.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:46.140]   As we look at 2 Corinthians chapter 7, verse 1 through 7, we see against all that I just
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:51.420]   said, against all the pain I just described to you, Apostle Paul's loyal heart of love
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.280]   for his spiritual children.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:58.220]   Apostle Paul's loyal heart to his spiritual children.
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:03.220]   I read again for you, and he says, "Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:10.180]   ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in fear of God.
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.820]   Make room for us in your heart."
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.820]   Again, he's vulnerable.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.000]   Again, he's making requests that's even hard for us.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.580]   He says, "We wronged no one.
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.040]   We corrupted no one.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.740]   We took advantage of no one."
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.920]   What he's meaning there is he had integrity.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.400]   There was no compromise.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.440]   He did right by them.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.340]   And then he says, "I do not speak to condemn you, for I have said before that you are in
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.100]   our hearts to die together and to live together."
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.100]   What is he saying?
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.940]   My intention.
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:42.860]   It's not to come down on you and destroy you.
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:48.260]   He has actually said in another passage that he does not write to destroy, but he wants
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:49.340]   to spare.
[00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:53.840]   He loves them so much he's willing to spare them.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.040]   He says, "I have said it before.
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:02.240]   You are in our hearts to die together and to live together."
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:07.560]   If you highlight in your Bible, if you draw or do stars, think about what he's saying
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.680]   when he says that, "I have said before, you are in my heart.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.160]   We die together and live together."
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.160]   What does that mean?
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:22.200]   All I'm going to say is, "Wow, what devoted loyalty."
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.600]   Have you guys seen that kind of loyalty in our day?
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:32.040]   I know you're sometimes arrogant, fleshly, you're selfish, defensive, and you're accusatory
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.380]   to me.
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:38.840]   But I've told you before, we're going to die together and we're going to live together.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:42.840]   What kind of loyalty is that?
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.560]   So Paul takes the initiative.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.780]   You might be willing to go chase after other teachers.
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.520]   You might be thinking that you have other parents.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.160]   But I'm telling you now, we die together and live together.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.560]   What kind of amazing loyalty that is.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.480]   Paul's heart is deep with love.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.700]   Paul's heart is deep with affection.
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:10.280]   And that's why when he says that he is writing this letter with tears, that's why when he
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:14.720]   says that he regrets, and sometimes he doesn't regret, you recognize that the struggle is
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.720]   real because the love is real.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.280]   Right?
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.520]   And I want to challenge you now.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:26.760]   Is it important for us at times in ministry to admonish, to exhort, to correct, and rebuke?
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.400]   And the answer is yes.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.760]   Because of the importance and because of the weight of ministry, whenever there is sin,
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.480]   it must be addressed.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.000]   Whenever there is ungodliness, it must be addressed.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.320]   But do you see the heart of Apostle Paul?
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.280]   He wants them to feel his love.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.680]   And he says, "I want you to know what kind of love I have for you."
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.440]   And the amazing thing about it is Apostle Paul does not delight.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.440]   He's not overjoyed and comforted.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:00.520]   He's not rejoicing just because, "Yes, finally, you get my authority.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.080]   Finally you listen.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.080]   Fools."
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:11.000]   No, he says, "I'm glad because I saw and I heard report of your longing, of your mourning
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.120]   and zeal."
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.280]   Apostle Paul has a heart of a parent.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.920]   To see you do well brings joy to my heart.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:25.360]   For every single one of us, whether you're currently in ministry, in some kind of role
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:30.400]   that God has designed for you to have authority and say over people as parents, husbands,
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:37.320]   wives, whatever it may be, well, they made this be an inspiration for us to have this
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.040]   kind of heart.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:45.480]   And Apostle Paul models for us what John says in 3 John 3-4, "For I was very glad when
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:49.800]   brethren came and testified to your truth, that is how you are walking in truth.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:55.000]   I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children walking in truth."
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.240]   This is the heart of every parent.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:04.420]   Not that on Mother's Day, on Father's Day, like, "There better be a banquet.
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.640]   You better show me your love."
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.860]   Like, that's not what parents are thinking.
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.400]   Parents want to know, "Are you well?
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.280]   Are you walking in the way that you should?"
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:19.160]   Now it is approaching that time where it's Mother's Day and Father's Day, so I just encourage
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.840]   every single one of you, show appreciation, you know?
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.760]   Show that gratitude.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:25.760]   Show that understanding.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.960]   It's like, "Man, I know you sacrificed a lot.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:33.880]   Might have done it a different way, you know?
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.520]   But I see your sacrifice and love."
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:41.840]   That's the heart of Apostle Paul, and that's what I wanted you to see, because that heart
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:48.880]   from Apostle Paul was consistent, consistent, and that heart was portrayed to the church,
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.040]   and the church now needed to respond to that.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:55.560]   What were they going to do now that the love of Apostle Paul came to them in a different
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.320]   format?
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.960]   Before it was just teaching, before it was just visits, before they were walking together,
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:06.800]   but now this letter comes, and it's a strong rebuke, a kind of letter that could have destroyed
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.800]   somebody, he says.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.800]   It literally could have owned them.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:12.800]   What are they going to respond with?
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.940]   What are they going to say?
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:18.640]   So now we move into the Corinthians' heart of sorrow and repentance.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.720]   Okay, the Corinthians' heart of sorrow and repentance.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:27.800]   Look at this passage with me in 2 Corinthians chapter 7, verse 8 through 12.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.920]   Chapter 7, verse 8 through 12.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.880]   And Apostle Paul says, "For though I cause you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it,
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:40.760]   though I did regret it, for I see that the letter caused you sorrow, though only for
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.760]   a little while."
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.680]   And again, you almost feel it, the heart of a parent.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:49.240]   It's like he knows he has to say what needs to be said.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:55.720]   He knows he has to do something that potentially even risks having his own children give him
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.440]   a longer stiff arm.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.000]   They already gave him one.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.640]   Now he's entertaining even the risk of even having bigger divide, right?
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:06.040]   So he's like, "I don't know if I…"
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:11.980]   Then he says, "But for a little while, now I rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful,
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.820]   but that you were made sorrowful to the point of repentance.
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:19.540]   For you were made sorrowful according to the will of God, so that you might not suffer
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.680]   loss in anything through us.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:28.080]   For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret,
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:32.440]   leading to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:38.220]   For behold what earnestness this very thing, this godly sorrow, has produced in you.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:45.960]   What vindication of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what avenging
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.280]   of wrong.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:51.280]   In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in the matter, so although I
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:56.040]   wrote to you, it was not for the sake of the offender nor the sake of the one offended,
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:03.800]   but that your earnestness on our behalf may be made known to you in the sight of God."
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:04.800]   Wow.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.280]   For the heart of the Corinthians, what a journey.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.280]   The church.
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:13.180]   It's not every single person in the church, but it seems to me that a mass pocket at least
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:17.080]   of the church went through a drastic journey.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:22.040]   One where they began with very antagonistic to Apostle Paul, one they were accusatory,
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.920]   rebellious, stubborn, very fleshly.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.960]   And clearly when Apostle Paul started speaking and saying, "You guys need to stop doing that
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.080]   and knock it off.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.120]   When you have feasts, wait for one another.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.160]   Why in the world are you running to the front?
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.160]   Don't be arrogant.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.200]   Don't have divisions.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.320]   Don't have this immorality be permitted in your church."
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.040]   And then all of a sudden people are like, "Who are you, dude?
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.040]   You're unimpressive.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:48.320]   Your speech, your image, everything about you is so-so, man.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.600]   Take it easy."
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:54.520]   And then it eventually came to a point where they did not like what he had to say.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:36:02.360]   However, what's clear here is that once they received the strong, strong rebuke, sorrow
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.360]   happened.
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:10.360]   Quickly, I ask you this question and I need you to think about a scenario.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.400]   Was there a moment in your life where somebody rebuked you harshly?
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:19.160]   Like they said, "Listen, man, I need to say something to you, okay?"
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.120]   And they told you like it is.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.280]   And they told you, "You're doing this and that and this."
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:28.920]   And it was just direct, it was immediate, and you're just like, "Whoa," right?
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.680]   Now if you can't think of something like that, then I want you to think of a scenario where
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:35.640]   you felt like a failure.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.960]   Every single one of us has felt sorrow, either because someone imposed it on you and said,
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.920]   "You need to recognize," and you're like, "Ugh," right?
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:48.400]   Or every single one of us, no matter how young we are, we have felt moments of failure.
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:53.000]   And I'm guessing for students, you felt like, "Oh my goodness, I can't carry this weight."
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.880]   Maybe at certain points, you felt like you disappointed your parents.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.520]   Those emotions are strong.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.120]   Maybe for those of you guys who are working, you felt like a failure because of X, Y, and
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.120]   Z.
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.760]   Husbands and wives, you felt like a failure because you couldn't fulfill your roles.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.420]   Parents, you felt like a failure because you couldn't control anger.
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:14.000]   Whatever it may be, we've had moments when we felt like we not only transgressed the
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.600]   standard of God, but the standard of the people, and you feel sorrow.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:21.840]   I need you to think about that moment.
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:26.280]   When was the last time you felt deep sorrow?
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.520]   Why?
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:33.080]   Because the question is, how did you respond to that sorrow?
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:40.920]   This passage is asking us, how do you respond to the sorrow that we are going to experience
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.640]   at one point or another in our lives?
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:47.360]   And Apostle Paul says there are two distinct paths.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:51.640]   One path is the sorrow of the world and death.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:57.300]   The other path brings salvation, joy, restoration.
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.240]   Do you know the difference?
[00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:04.120]   When you tell within yourself which path of sorrow you're taking, if you have moments
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:08.660]   when you're being rebuked, if you have moments when you're being corrected, or you yourself
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:12.140]   feel the guilt, what do you do?
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:14.840]   I'm going to walk with you down certain things.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:20.240]   A, there is a sorrow of the world, and very clearly, the indicator is that it produces
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.560]   death.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:24.100]   What kind of sorrow produces death?
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.320]   You know what I'm going to do?
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:30.920]   I'm going to say certain verbiage, certain phrases that I've heard from myself and I've
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.640]   heard before.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:38.760]   And you ask yourself, has your thoughts, have the internal voice ever said these things?
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:43.500]   For example, someone comes to you and rebukes you strongly, and instinctually, your heart
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.440]   starts to say, "What?
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.480]   Why do you hate me so much?
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.200]   You don't trust me?
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.160]   If you don't want me around, just say it."
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.180]   Were there ever that kind of resentment?
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:56.900]   Was there ever that kind of defensiveness?
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.000]   Maybe there's something of wounded pride.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   "What?
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.720]   I've been good to you, actually.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.680]   Do you discredit everything I've done?
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.920]   You're saying I'm all bad?
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.920]   Am I all wicked?"
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.840]   Has your heart ever said that?
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:13.800]   That's a heart leaning towards bitterness.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.800]   Perhaps there was despair.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.440]   "Fine, then, if you think that, then I'm no good.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.360]   What am I going to do?"
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.360]   "Fine.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.480]   I'm just a bad, bad person, I admit it.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.480]   I'm so bad, I'm not even going to try anymore.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.120]   I'm so bad, God can't even forgive me.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.800]   I'm so bad, I'm just going to go in a corner.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:36.580]   I'm so bad, I'm going to quit."
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:43.400]   Maybe you haven't said those things verbally, but in sorrow, have you ran away and escaped?
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.700]   In sorrow, have you given up and quit?
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:54.500]   So many people, so many people resort to this kind of sorrow, and clearly it produces hopelessness
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.240]   and depression.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:01.700]   Right now in America, the statistic is 50 million plus people in America say they have
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:09.300]   clinical depression or some kind of depression where they struggle with thoughts of suicide.
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:13.840]   That absolutely breaks my heart because what it says is, "Yes, we know every single one
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:20.340]   of us is going to feel sorrow to some degree, but there's a massive portion of us that have
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:23.140]   no idea what to do about it."
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:26.240]   And that breaks my heart.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:31.380]   We have to stop looking at, "Oh my gosh, look at my broken hand, look at my broken feet,
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:35.100]   look at my feeble knees, look how weak I am."
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:38.300]   And the gospel says, "Look to Christ.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:40.820]   There is hope not here.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.980]   There is hope with Christ, amen?
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:46.820]   There is absolute hope with Christ."
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:52.100]   And this passage is going to talk about how this reaction to sorrow, this reaction to
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:59.320]   guilt, this genuine repentance is going to lead you to hope and change.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:05.020]   And so Apostle Paul says, "Rather than just having horizontal shame, rather than defensiveness,
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:12.980]   resentment, rather than depression, rather than hopelessness, let there be godly sorrow
[00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.780]   where it produces repentance."
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:20.520]   And you guys know that repentance is pretty much synonymous with change.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.180]   Is there going to be a change of thought?
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:24.000]   Is there going to be a change of belief?
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.620]   Is there going to be a change of will?
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:27.340]   Is there going to be a change of desire?
[00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:31.420]   Is there going to be then a resulting change of action and a change of behavior?
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:36.220]   But what I'd like to highlight for you as I wrap this sermon up and point to is when
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:41.100]   Apostle Paul looks at these people, he says, "There has been a godly sorrow in you and
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:45.260]   what I see is earnestness."
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.900]   He repeats it twice.
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:52.380]   And he says, "Behold," and he says, "Look at this thing."
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.480]   What am I talking about?
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.620]   Look at the passage again.
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:42:02.740]   And he says, starting from verse 10, "The sorrow that is according to the will of God
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:07.220]   produces repentance without regret, leading to salvation, but the sorrow of the world
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.700]   produces death.
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.860]   For behold."
[00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:16.140]   Anytime he says, "For behold," you should stop there and put exclamation point.
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:19.460]   He is pointing a finger and saying, "Look."
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:20.460]   What does he say?
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:26.700]   "Look at the earnestness, this very thing, this godly sorrow has produced in you."
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:31.740]   Essentially, he is equating godly sorrow with earnestness.
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:36.980]   He's equating this eagerness, longing, and he describes it as zeal.
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:42.340]   He describes it as mournful longing to be with Apostle Paul, to reconcile, and then
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:44.380]   he describes it in further indications.
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.220]   And we don't have time to go over all this stuff.
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:49.220]   So those of you guys who are thinking like, "Wow, you had a long introduction.
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:50.380]   The sermon is going long."
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.540]   Is he going to go through all these points?
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:55.500]   My answer is going to be, we're going to fly through it and get to one singular point.
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:43:01.140]   There is vindication, there is indignation, meaning anger towards the sin, there is fear,
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:05.540]   fear of offending God, fear of sinning again, there is longing, there is zeal, there is
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:09.860]   avenging, and there is a demonstration that they want to be clear and innocent of the
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.380]   entire matter.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:14.380]   What does that show you?
[00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:15.580]   Important question right there.
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.680]   What does that show you?
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:22.360]   And to make sense of all this, I want to give you a tangible case scenario.
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.700]   Imagine if I was a lazy, lazy boy.
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:30.780]   So lazy I grew up in absolute neglect of my responsibilities and my parents kept having
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:34.820]   to scold me, "Pick up your clothes, put away your dish."
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:38.640]   I went off to college and I was the laziest boy ever.
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.180]   My roommates felt like they had to do intervention.
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:46.060]   The roommates had a team meeting and said, "We need to go talk to Mark because that got
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:48.420]   him lazy."
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:52.580]   And then after graduating college, I was so lazy, I went back home rather than looking
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:56.740]   for work, I didn't even try, I just went back home and said, "I'm here."
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.580]   And the parents are like, "Oh goodness."
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:02.900]   I lived at home for two, three years without even trying to find work and my parents all
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:05.060]   of a sudden decide, "I need to talk to you."
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.180]   Why am I going through this long example?
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:13.220]   Because I just want to show you that in this scenario, I deserve to be harshly rebuked.
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:19.580]   The parents come down and say, "Mark, lazy boy, you need to understand.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.660]   You've been lazy in high school, you've been lazy in college and you're lazy now.
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:26.220]   And your neglect is hurting people.
[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:30.660]   It's hurting your brother, it's hurting your sister, it's hurting us because we're sitting
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.780]   here worried to death about you.
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:34.220]   What's going to come of you?
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:35.700]   You need to understand.
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.500]   Do you get it?"
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:44.340]   And imagine lazy boy Mark goes, "Okay, I get it."
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:47.980]   Would you be happy with that?
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:49.620]   Honest question.
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:53.280]   Lazy boy Mark said to the parents and mom and dad, "Okay, I get it."
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.460]   Would you be happy with that?
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:56.700]   Probably not, right?
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:00.860]   Mom and dad would be like, "Look, I'm not about to talk to you.
[00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:01.860]   What do you mean okay?
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:05.660]   Do you mean okay like I heard you but I don't agree?
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.500]   Do you mean okay like I heard you but I do agree?
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:09.500]   What do you mean?"
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.140]   Frustrated, right?
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:12.940]   It's very frustrating.
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:16.740]   And then lazy boy Mark goes, "I said okay.
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.380]   I get it, okay?
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:19.380]   I get what you're saying."
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:22.540]   And parents are like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:26.700]   I know you heard me but I really want to know."
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.180]   And lazy boy Mark was like, "What?
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.020]   You want me to cry about it or something?
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.020]   Fine, give me some money.
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:32.020]   Let me rub it right here and cry.
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.020]   You want me to cry?"
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:35.960]   And the parents are like, "Oh my...
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:36.960]   Get your own onion.
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:39.620]   Look how lazy you are."
[00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:40.620]   Parents would be frustrated, right?
[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:41.800]   Now the conversation is...
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:42.800]   There's no conversation.
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:43.800]   Why?
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:47.960]   Because they're just like...
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:51.800]   And the parents are like, "Oh, what do we do with you?
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.640]   What's wrong?
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.440]   What's wrong in this scenario?"
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:00.620]   And this is what I'm talking about is true repentance.
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:05.380]   He says, "Looks like earnestness."
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:10.220]   You see, there is this principle I learned through doing my devotions through this.
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:14.940]   You know, the reason why I walk through from Apostle Paul's perspective is because he has
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:18.780]   a desire for the church, his children.
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:22.260]   And my first question is, have I accepted that desire?
[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:24.980]   Do I understand his desire?
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:31.300]   And the second thing is this, my level of sorrow is directly correlated with my desire.
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:33.480]   Let me repeat that, okay?
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:39.620]   My level of sorrow is directly correlated with my level of desire.
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:42.740]   And that's why when we're kids, your parents say, "No, you can't have that."
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:43.740]   And you're like...
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:50.540]   And you're just crying like the world is over because in that moment, that's all I want.
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:54.940]   What I've also seen, there are people who come into my office crying, bawling, you know,
[00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:55.940]   and they're like...
[00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:58.940]   And I'm going, "Okay, got my notepad out, I'm ready."
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.140]   It's like, "What's going on?"
[00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:03.620]   They're like, "I lost my patience with my kid."
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:06.220]   I'm like, "Oh, I do that all the time."
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:12.300]   You know, like part of me is like, it's like it's light, you know, but why?
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:17.660]   And I get rebuked by that because I realize I'm inspired, like, "Oh my goodness, you want
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:24.180]   so badly to be a good parent that your moment of weakness in failing to be patient with
[00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:25.580]   your child breaks you."
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:28.500]   Right?
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:33.060]   Your level of sorrow is directly correlated with the level of your desire.
[00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:36.820]   And when that desire is unmet, your sorrow grows deep.
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:43.340]   If your desire is deep, then your desire denied is going to produce in you an incredible amount
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:44.340]   of sorrow.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:45.700]   So let me ask you this.
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:50.700]   Is it fair for me to look at Lazy Mark and say, "It is very clear to me, you don't want
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.340]   diligence.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.820]   You don't want what I'm saying to you.
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:58.980]   You can say okay to me, but I'm going to judge you right now.
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:00.820]   You don't want it."
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.900]   Is that fair?
[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:06.260]   You don't want what I want for you.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:10.360]   How can you sit there and say, "Okay, I said okay."
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.320]   You can't do that.
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:16.700]   As exhortation to you, we many times, we're all guilty of this.
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:17.900]   I'm guilty of this.
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.220]   There are moments when I'm like, "Oh, I should be more patient."
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:21.940]   There are moments I'm like, "I should be more humble.
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.540]   Honestly, I should be more humble."
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:29.580]   I say things haphazardly to my wife sometimes, and I'm like, "Ugh," like my mouth, gosh.
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:32.100]   We all struggle with those certain frustrations.
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:41.040]   If I see it like haphazard little mistakes, of course, why would I be sorrowful?
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:45.980]   But there are moments, and you guys all know, when you're sober and you're like...
[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:51.100]   You know, like in marriage, you look at your wife and you're like, "I want to be a good
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:53.700]   husband so bad."
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:57.100]   And even moments when I neglect you, it breaks my heart.
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.100]   Why?
[00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:00.180]   Because you know I love you.
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:02.540]   Because you know I want to be a good husband to you.
[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:08.340]   Because I want to be fulfilling God's design, but also I want to be fulfilling your desire
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:10.420]   for love.
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:14.060]   And so even in my neglect, it breaks me.
[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:18.260]   And to you, where is your earnestness?
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:23.980]   In areas of humility, in areas of caution, love, care, patience, in all of these things,
[00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:27.100]   where is your degree of desire?
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:33.380]   Can people watch you and say, "Behold, what earnestness."
[00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:35.020]   Look at him.
[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:36.620]   Look at the vindication.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:41.620]   Look at the longing, the mourning, the desire to be innocent, and all of this.
[00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:45.820]   I am not asking you to go have a good cry.
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:50.420]   I'm asking you to look deep because the Lord looks right here.
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.420]   Right?
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:54.700]   And he asks you, "What do you want?
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.680]   What do you want most of all?"
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:00.300]   And this is where Christian repentance happens.
[00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.700]   This is part of the gospel.
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:07.660]   God affords us the opportunity to repent simply of your desire.
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:14.180]   "God, I repent of the desires that I've had to secure my own, to be fleshly, to satisfy
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.260]   myself.
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:23.660]   And right now, I confess to you, even though I have some of these desires, you know I love
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:24.660]   you.
[00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:26.820]   You know I want what you want for me.
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.420]   If you can confess that."
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:32.420]   The Lord says, "Look at this.
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:35.700]   What longing, what mourning, what zeal."
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:42.500]   And God satisfies that longing and says, "In that kind of repentance, there is no regret."
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:44.160]   Amen?
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.540]   And I pray for all of us.
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:52.100]   We today walk through Apostle Paul's heart for his church, but we know that is reflective
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:55.940]   of the Christ and God Apostle Paul knows.
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:58.900]   God has sacrificed for us as a good father.
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:50:59.900]   Amen?
[00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:05.980]   And in our appreciation of that, we then turn to him and say, "God, I trust your heart and
[00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.940]   your desire for me.
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.980]   I desire the same."
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:10.980]   Let's pray.
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:21.440]   Lord, Heavenly Father, we thank you for your fatherly love.
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.280]   We call you Father in many of our prayers.
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.560]   We sing about you.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:33.120]   And today we get a greater glimpse and a greater appreciation by walking through this passage.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:38.180]   You have sent for us, Father God, even individuals in our lives to care for us.
[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:44.800]   And it's all reflective of your protective, involved love and affection for us.
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:48.140]   And to that, God, we say, "Thank you, thank you."
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:53.660]   And Lord, I pray that all of that would then affect us deeply to trust your intent, to
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:52:00.980]   trust your love, and to help us, Father God, to come to you with genuine repentance, submitting
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:07.660]   to you not only simply our minds and our concepts and beliefs, but truly the will and desire
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:09.480]   of our hearts.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:13.340]   And I ask, Father God, that by the Spirit you would help us to examine, are there any
[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:16.020]   hurtful ways in us?
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:22.060]   Are there any self-preserving, self-excusing, self-defensive mentalities in us that we need
[00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:24.380]   to lay down before you?
[00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:27.500]   And I pray that by your Spirit you would help us do that.
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:28.500]   We thank you and love you.
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:29.500]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:30.220]   Amen.
