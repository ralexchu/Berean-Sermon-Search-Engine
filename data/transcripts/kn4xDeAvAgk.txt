[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.800]   (soft piano music)
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:10.080]   - Good morning, church family.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.200]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.640]   This morning, we'd like to introduce a new song.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.080]   It's called "He Will Keep You" by Sovereign Grace.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.480]   The song is based on Psalm 121,
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.520]   and I'll read a portion of it here from the ESV.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.600]   The Lord will keep you from all evil.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.280]   He will keep your life.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.320]   The Lord will keep your going out and your coming in
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.480]   from this time forth and forevermore.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.600]   When the Bible says the Lord will keep us from all evil,
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.560]   it is not to say that we will not experience
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.440]   any evil in our lives,
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.520]   but that the Lord will preserve us
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.840]   even as we are facing it.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.320]   I'd like to borrow from Spurgeon, and I quote,
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.640]   "Three times you have the phrase, 'Jehovah shall keep,'
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.600]   "as if the sacred trinity thus sealed the word
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.080]   "to make it sure.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.760]   "Ought not all our fears to be slain
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.480]   "by such a threefold flight of arrows?
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.200]   "What anxiety can survive this triple promise?"
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.680]   Brothers and sisters, this morning let us reflect
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.200]   on our lives and how he has been faithful.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.440]   Consider our failings, our lowest moments,
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.360]   our hardest times, times of deep sorrow,
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.840]   and how his tender mercies and sustaining love
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.360]   has carried us through,
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.000]   and how he sustains us still today.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.440]   He who did not spare his own son
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.160]   but gave him up for us all,
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.560]   will he not also with him graciously give us all things?
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.480]   And he who began a good work in you,
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.640]   will he not be faithful to bring it to completion
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.560]   until Christ's return?
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.520]   So let us praise the Lord this morning.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:41.760]   (gentle piano music)

[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:23.420]   - All right, good morning.
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.500]   Welcome to Brain Community Church.
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.920]   Let me get to a few announcements before we get started.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.460]   First of all, as you guys know,
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.260]   we have a members meeting that's taking place
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.980]   at two o'clock today.
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.080]   And so after the third service,
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.580]   actually after this service and the third service,
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.140]   there is lunch fundraiser that's happening
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.100]   with our college students,
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.500]   and they have a retreat coming up, so they're doing that.
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.340]   And so if you, after this service,
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.580]   if you're members of the church, please take your food,
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.220]   and hopefully we have enough parking.
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.220]   But if you're gonna go off, you can just buy it
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.300]   and then take it off and then eat it somewhere, okay?
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.460]   We'll see, we'll see how that goes.
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.540]   But after the third service also, we're gonna have lunch,
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.500]   and then at two o'clock, we're gonna meet here.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:11.500]   And again, so that's happening right after service.
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.460]   Members meeting again at two o'clock.
[00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:19.080]   Members class is starting today, actually, at 9.30.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.220]   That's happening during second service.
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.660]   Family ministry workshop, January 20th,
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.540]   this coming Saturday.
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.540]   Those of you who are a FAM245,
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.420]   who've been married three years or less,
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.780]   again, that workshop is happening this coming Saturday.
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.260]   Bible Lab, again, in January 21st, 28th,

[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.940]   from going through how to do inductive Bible study,
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.460]   that class is for you.
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.580]   That'll help you to jump into the Bible study
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.460]   that we're having.
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.740]   Intentional Sisters Fellowship.
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.100]   This is a new round of ISF with the sisters.
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.140]   If you are part of the BAM ministry or family ministry,
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.900]   there's three slots that they have.
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.420]   They have Monday nights, and then Thursday morning
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.860]   at 9.30 to 11.30, and Friday morning 9.30 to 11.30.
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.860]   So two morning sessions, and then one Monday night.
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.840]   So you can choose of the three.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.420]   They're gonna be reading the book together,
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.480]   Practice of Godliness by Jerry Bridges.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.380]   So please sign up for that if you're planning
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.660]   to participate in the ISF.
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.100]   And then Galatians Bible Study,
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.220]   if you haven't signed up for that,
[00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.180]   please sign up for that as soon as possible.
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.500]   That will help us greatly to be able to prepare
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.840]   for the small groups and the home groups.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.980]   So if you're planning to do it and you haven't done it,
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.060]   please do it today if possible.
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.700]   And then there's announcements from the FIG ministry,
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.020]   a new ministry that we're starting for the,
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.300]   it's a segment of ministry in the family ministry
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.280]   that if you're not part of the FAM 245 newlyweds,
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.900]   or if you're not over 50, that ministry is for you.
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.660]   And so we're gonna be presenting during the members meeting
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.860]   how that's organized, what the purpose of it is,
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.740]   and our brother Dean is going to be coming and presenting.
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.420]   But they are starting, the FIG ministry,
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.400]   the new ministry, and Jubilee ministry, 50 and over,
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.640]   they're gonna be having the yearly Bible reading together.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.120]   So they want to fellowship together meaningfully,
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.540]   and so they're taking sign-ups after the third service.
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.460]   So not this service, but right before, during lunchtime,
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.600]   there's gonna be a table out there
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.760]   where you can go sign up for that.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.120]   So if you're part of that ministry
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.480]   and you want to participate in that,
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.320]   please go to that table and sign up for that, okay?
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.720]   I think that's it for today.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.060]   After, let me pray for us, and then afterwards,
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.660]   again, if you have a physical offering,
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.500]   please, we have a box in the back.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.460]   Otherwise, we're gonna be giving online, okay?
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.020]   Let me pray for us, and then after our worship,
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.860]   our brother Marvin's gonna be coming up
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.540]   and giving his testimony to be baptized this morning.
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.380]   Let's pray.
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:52.580]   Father, we thank you so much for the constant blessing
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.940]   that you give our lives.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.360]   Thank you, Father, that you have given us eternal life,
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.820]   that we have hope in eternity,
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.840]   that through the ups and downs, Lord God,
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.680]   of living in this sinful world,
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.000]   that our feet are firmly planted, Lord,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.040]   on the promises that you've given.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.160]   I pray that our worship will be an overflow of gratitude
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.240]   of everything that you give us,
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.120]   that it would be given to you in spirit and in truth.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.640]   I pray, Father God, that even in this giving,
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.800]   help us to give it as an act of worship,
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.020]   and again, that may it be multiplied and handled wisely
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.100]   for the sake of your kingdom.

[00:23:51.740 --> 00:24:07.860]   - Hello, my name's Marvin Del High.
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.740]   And first off, sorry.
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.700]   I'm like excited.
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.900]   And first off, I want to give all the glory
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.900]   to our Heavenly Father for saving a wretched sinner like me.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:25.300]   In Matthew 5, 3, 6, "Blessed are the poor in spirit,
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.000]   "for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.360]   "Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.200]   "Blessed are the gentle, for they shall inherit the earth.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.260]   "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.760]   "for they shall be satisfied."
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.740]   My walk with God began when the seed was planted
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.060]   when I was 17.
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.780]   Before then, I grew up learning about sorcery,
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.680]   witchcraft, and necromancy,
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.100]   disguised as Navajo traditions.
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.100]   A friend of mine told me about Jesus,
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.240]   and I started to attend church from there.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:59.140]   The love of the local church drew me in,
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.900]   and that's about it.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.400]   I still had the belief that Jesus died
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.560]   on the other side of the world
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.460]   and had nothing to do with my people.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.660]   I acted like a Christian for a couple of years,
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.980]   attending church because of obligation
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.560]   and not for the love of Christ,
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.640]   until I decided to stop faking it and left altogether.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.080]   A little over a decade worth of a hardened heart
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.440]   and decisiveness and being a victim,
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.620]   acting like I had everything together,
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.640]   just brought me back to many tears
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.480]   and just keep trying to keep on keeping on.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.440]   On September 3rd, 2022, I was at Irvine Spectrum,
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.840]   just by coincidence, and two brothers from Berean
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.680]   shared the good news with me,
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.740]   and I was skeptical at first.
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.520]   However, with love, I was challenged
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.680]   by the brethren of my past thinking
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.600]   and actually see God for real at this time.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.200]   All my hardships from my past
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.460]   soon turned to blessings when I take scripture to heart.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:01.760]   I thank God he didn't answer my prayers for physical death
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.200]   and intervene on my suicide attempts.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.200]   Instead, his blessing was that I was able to die to self
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.180]   so I could follow him.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:16.000]   God loved me and called me even when I hated myself.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.720]   I am blessed to have been spiritually confused
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.560]   because I am able to see more clearly of his word
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.360]   and the realness it has.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:28.200]   It is a blessing to lose my brother on my graduation night.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.120]   The seed of just knowing Christ
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.120]   was planted to my family members,
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.520]   and now my siblings and my mom are attending service
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.220]   and went away from traditions.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.760]   It is a blessing to struggle
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.720]   with the feelings of being unwanted.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.160]   God's shown his love and mercy and always there for me,
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.680]   and I am no longer praying why am I alive
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.820]   and why am I not good enough to be loved.
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.640]   It is a blessing to have struggled with alcohol addiction
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.780]   because I know now God was with me during rehab
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.720]   in what seemed like rock bottom at the time
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.480]   he used for his glory,
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:07.000]   and no longer have the need to numb myself
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   into the next day.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.040]   It is a blessing to grow up in a fatherless home
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.560]   because I found comfort through our heavenly father,
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.280]   and I was given the strength to forgive my earthly father,
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.480]   and the father-son relationship started to bloom.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.600]   God has changed my way of thinking and has done so much,
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.480]   and I'm glad to dedicate my life
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.000]   now knowing the full weight of baptism,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.720]   and I'm so, so grateful just to be born again,
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.440]   and I'm just so, so grateful just to be born again,
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.480]   and now I wanna take the next step seriously.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.880]   Thank you.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.880]   (audience applauds)
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:28:05.080]   - Marvin, do you understand when you go into the water
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.600]   you're being united with Christ in his death?
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.960]   You're coming out to Christ's resurrected life?
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:16.520]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:22.000]   (audience applauds)
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.960]   Marvin, thank you so much for that powerful testimony,
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.920]   and as he has shared, he was able to come to our church
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.160]   after a couple of our brothers
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.680]   were out on the streets and evangelizing,
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.600]   and so they met him, invited him to church,
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.880]   and then so we've been seeing him growing and maturing,
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.000]   and again, to see him baptized today,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.320]   what a blessing it is.
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.560]   We have an outreach team at church.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.680]   Just give you a plug.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.920]   Outreach team at church that goes out once a month
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.400]   to Brenna Park and then at Spectrum,
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.720]   and so we have quite a few brothers and sisters
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.120]   who are going out, and we encourage you to come
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.240]   and participate in that,
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.360]   and even if you've never done street evangelism,
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.000]   you can team up with somebody,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.160]   and then you can learn to hear how they're doing that,
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.160]   and you'd be surprised.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.640]   Oftentimes, we're in Orange County.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.960]   We think, oh, this is saturated.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.800]   We have a mega church,
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.600]   like 10-minute driving distance in any direction.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.880]   You'd be surprised how few people really know the gospel.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.400]   'Cause we typically think like we need to drive to India,
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.160]   and we need to go out to China or certain places,
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.640]   and we wanna spread the gospel
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.400]   where the gospel has not spread.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:45.800]   Interesting thing is this is not a Christian nation
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.000]   in the sense that it's filled with Christians,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.040]   saturated with Christians.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.520]   Maybe at one point, it was.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.440]   This is a post-Christian nation
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.720]   where we have imprints of Christianity
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.840]   everywhere in our society,
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.040]   but the number of actual Christians
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.600]   who are living out their faith
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.760]   and actually even know what the gospel is is a minority.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.840]   Even in Orange County, you'd be surprised.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.760]   At one point, we sent the whole church out
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.880]   just to take a survey so that the church can see
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.960]   how few people actually are able to articulate the gospel,
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.760]   even the people who go to church,
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.400]   and it's a minority, very small minority of people
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.520]   can even articulate what it is that they believe,
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.480]   and so you and I are living in the mission field
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.760]   in a post-Christian culture.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:34.080]   So again, that's a plug for every Saturday,
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:35.600]   or not every Saturday, once a month on Saturday,
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.480]   that they have an outreach team
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.320]   that gets together and prays for people,
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.320]   and so please pray for them,
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.980]   or we invite you to come and join them when they do go out.
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.480]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Ephesians 6,
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.480]   and I'm just gonna be reading verse 18 for the sake of time.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.580]   Actually, you know what?
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.500]   I'm gonna read the whole thing, starting from verse 10.
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.340]   Changed my mind.
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.080]   This is the longer service, so.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.400]   All right, first service.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.660]   I have to watch out my time, but.
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:02.500]   Starting from verse 10.
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.820]   "Finally, be strong in the Lord,
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.120]   "and in the strength of his might,
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.380]   "put on the full armor of God,
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.940]   "so that you will be able to stand firm
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.780]   "against the schemes of the devil.
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.520]   "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.240]   "but against the rulers, against the powers,
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:16.640]   "against the world forces of this darkness,
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.240]   "against the spiritual forces of wickedness
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.300]   "in the heavenly places.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.560]   "Therefore, take up the full armor of God,
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.960]   "so that you will be able to resist in the evil day,
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.320]   "and having done everything, to stand firm.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.680]   "Stand firm, therefore, having girded your loins with truth,
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.000]   "and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.240]   "and having shod your feet with preparation
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.680]   "of the gospel of peace.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.540]   "In addition to all, taking up the shield of faith,
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.280]   "with which you will be able to extinguish
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.280]   "all the flaming arrows of the evil one,
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.680]   "and take the helmet of salvation,
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.000]   "and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.520]   "With all prayer and petition,
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.280]   "pray at all times in the spirit,
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.440]   "and with this in view, be on the alert
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.400]   "with all perseverance, and petition for all the saints,
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.580]   "and pray on behalf that utterance may be given to me
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.320]   "in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.000]   "the mystery of the gospel."
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.840]   Let's pray.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:08.280]   Father, give us understanding, open our eyes,
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.120]   soften our hearts, Lord God,
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:12.700]   that your word would not be empty words,
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:15.960]   but it would be direction, it would be our refuge,
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.080]   it would be our guide.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.400]   Lead us and guide us, Lord God,
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.000]   that we may hear from you and you alone.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.720]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:26.280]   I wanna read you two quotes this morning
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.240]   before I get started.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.960]   One from Charles Spurgeon, if you can go.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.620]   Charles Spurgeon says, "I know of no better thermometer
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.440]   "to your spiritual temperature than this,
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.200]   "the measure of the intensity of your prayers."
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.780]   Like, where are you spiritually?
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.200]   How are you doing, right?
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.040]   And we may look at, am I studying the Bible,
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.040]   am I doing quiet time?
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:50.660]   Charles Spurgeon says, "A more accurate thermometer
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.120]   "to be able to measure the spiritual health of somebody
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.480]   "is the intensity of your prayer."
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.640]   Martin Lloyd-Jones, the next quote, says,
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.660]   "The first great characteristic of us as Christian people
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:04.020]   "as that is that we are no longer self-confident.
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.920]   "We know the truth about ourselves."
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.380]   Now, these are related quotes, right?
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.160]   Not related because they knew each other,
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.020]   but related because they're pretty much
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:15.120]   saying the same thing.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:19.160]   A spiritual mature person is not an individual
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.620]   who's growing in his ability.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.700]   A spiritual mature person is not somebody
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:28.280]   who's read the Bible and is able to articulate his faith
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.800]   and has so many experiences
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.520]   and have done so many things for God
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.080]   and all those things, though it is important,
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.680]   the true measure of a spiritual mature person
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.640]   is a growing recognition of his inability.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.760]   And as a result of that, he is more and more
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:46.400]   dependent upon God than when he first began.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.800]   That's a spiritually mature person.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.920]   Spiritual mature person is not somebody who's gifted,
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:53.340]   so they're able to articulate, organize, disciple.
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:57.160]   Before we get to any of that,
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.360]   a true mature Christian is a growing recognition
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:04.440]   is of his inability because he knows who God is.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.140]   He knows the gap between us and God
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.720]   and what God has called us to do, we are unable.
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:15.120]   It is only a small child who doesn't know his limitation
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.260]   because he hasn't experienced life
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:20.040]   that thinks that I can handle whatever it may be coming.
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.880]   And as parents, we guide them and lead them.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.880]   They don't know what they're talking about.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.960]   A spiritual immature person may take on the task,
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:30.000]   spiritual task, of their own spiritual growth,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.040]   of this spiritual battle and say, I'm gonna do it,
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.100]   I'm gonna apply myself, I'm gonna be disciplined,
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.520]   I'm gonna learn, I'm gonna read,
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.400]   I'm gonna get organized so that we can bear more fruit.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.960]   But that's not what the Bible says.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.820]   The Bible says you cannot bear fruit unless you abide in me.
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.840]   And there's nothing more important
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.560]   that you and I need to engage in than to fervent prayer
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:55.000]   because prayer ultimately is humbling ourselves before God
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.440]   because we recognize that this is beyond us,
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.160]   that only when God is engaged,
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:05.160]   only when God is called upon can we make any difference.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:09.200]   In fact, in 2 Chronicles 7, 14 to 15,
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.280]   after King Solomon builds the temple,
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.360]   and you can kind of say this was
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:15.320]   the first physical church, right?
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.100]   After he builds the temple,
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.280]   they have a dedication ceremony and God says this,
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.680]   as a dedication ceremony, he says this,
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.400]   my people who are called by my name
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.280]   humble themselves and pray, right?
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:30.360]   First and foremost, right?
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.040]   Is to humble themselves and pray.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.080]   Not to get organized, not to work harder,
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.560]   but first and foremost, the reason why he needs to be humble
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:41.000]   is because he recognizes that he is desperate for God.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:45.560]   When he humbles himself and pray and seeks my face
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.600]   and turn from his wicked ways,
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.520]   then I will hear from heaven,
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.240]   will forgive their sin, will heal their land.
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:55.520]   Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.360]   to the prayer offered in this place.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:03.400]   So as the first temple is dedicated,
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.600]   God calls this, this is a house of what?
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.120]   House of prayer.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.640]   Before it is a house of gathering,
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.320]   before it is a house of learning and training
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.920]   and discipling, he said first and foremost,
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:19.920]   this is a house of prayer where we come to engage God,
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.960]   where we come to pray, humble ourselves and seek him.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:27.520]   He says when we do that, he says he will be attentive
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.560]   to the prayers offered in this place.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:35.640]   I can't emphasize enough how important this prayer is,
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.120]   not only for our church, but individually, right?
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.960]   Every day that we function, every year that we function
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:46.120]   without fervent prayer is indirectly saying
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.320]   I can do this without you, right?
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.540]   Everything that you're telling me to do in this book,
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.280]   I'm gonna do my best, I'm gonna apply, I'm gonna study,
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.860]   I'm gonna know and I'm gonna implement.
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:01.160]   What he has called us to do is a spiritual battle.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.880]   It is not by flesh and blood.
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:08.160]   So either you will become proud
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.880]   if you think that you're having some success, right,
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.320]   because you're gifted, you're talented,
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.960]   or you read a lot or you know more,
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:17.840]   or you become defeated 'cause I'm not able
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.400]   because they're better than me.
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:26.240]   Prayer is ultimately us recognizing
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:31.800]   that this is beyond us and we have to pray, right?
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.640]   We have to pray.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:36.280]   This is not we should pray, we should do our best to pray.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:39.600]   We have to pray and so we talked about last week
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:44.200]   that our theme for this year and maybe for as long
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.760]   as I'm a pastor here, maybe this is gonna be our theme,
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.920]   right, and I'm gonna keep saying this
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.120]   until we feel like, you know, that's enough,
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.200]   we're praying too much, you know what I mean?
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.120]   We need to do something else, right?
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.360]   Until we get to that point, this is how important it is.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:02.260]   If I came up here and told you that I had no time
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:06.040]   to prepare for a sermon but I'm gonna talk anyway, right?
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.440]   I'm just gonna see what the Holy Spirit has to say
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.200]   this morning and then just kind of like, let's see.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.200]   If I came up here and told you that that's how I came up
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.320]   here, who among you are gonna take me serious, right?
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.920]   Then you shouldn't be preaching.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:23.800]   But yet, if I told you that there was no prayer involved,
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.640]   that I didn't depend on God, in the Western church,
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.600]   it doesn't skip a beat.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.560]   We don't recognize the importance of prayer
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:35.040]   in the Western church and so, and I believe
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.520]   that this is the condition of our church.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.000]   Even though I'm the pastor and I'm guilty of it,
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.280]   we need to keep striving toward this direction
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:45.800]   because this is how important this really is.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.340]   So last week, we talked about praying in the spirit,
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:52.720]   first and foremost, that we need to gear up, right?
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.640]   That we're not just running without aim,
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.920]   we're not just shadow boxing, we're just kind of
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:02.520]   floating along and if you just do what comes naturally,
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.080]   I can predict to you, right?
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.760]   The 80% accuracy, I'm not 100%, I'm not a prophet,
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.200]   with 80% accuracy because I've been doing this a long time.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:16.140]   Seeing what happens in college students,
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.640]   what happens in freshmen, junior, senior,
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.560]   what happens when you graduate, after you graduate,
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.360]   what happens when you start dating.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.880]   After you start dating, you start getting married,
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.320]   having children and there's nothing new under the sun.
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.060]   Seeing it over and over again for over 30 years,
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.880]   your life is very predictable.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.020]   What you're gonna wrestle with,
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.740]   the temptation that's gonna come into your life,
[00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.620]   the struggle that happens is very predictable.
[00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:44.020]   If all you're doing is just going and just following
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.140]   what comes natural, right?
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.420]   And you're living by your flesh and not by the spirit.
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.640]   It's very predictable.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:55.960]   First and foremost, if we're gonna live our lives
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.300]   purposefully, we need to commit.
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.460]   And that's why he says, first and foremost,
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.740]   to gird up your loins with the truth
[00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:06.920]   and your feet, put on the proper shoes to get ready.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.740]   That we're not gonna just coast along and, you know,
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.780]   like, I'm gonna eat good food,
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.300]   I'm gonna keep our family healthy,
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:14.700]   I'm gonna make some good investments
[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:18.460]   and no different than anybody else in the world.
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:21.900]   What do you want at the end of 2024 and say,
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.860]   this is what I strove after, this is what I sought after.
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.620]   What are you committed to do?
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:32.180]   He says, gird up your loins with truth.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:35.960]   Get ready, right, prepare yourself for action, right?
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:40.580]   If you're studying the Bible and you're not ready
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:44.180]   to apply it, all the Bible is is decoration.
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:47.020]   It's just a fashion show, right?
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.220]   So you can have somebody puts on clothes,
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:51.340]   it depends, if you're getting ready to go to work
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:53.020]   and you're doing construction,
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:56.380]   you're gonna have to put on the proper clothing, right?
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:59.780]   And proper shoes, but if you're going on a fashion show,
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:03.260]   right, nice heels, shiny, you're not gonna have to run,
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.620]   you're not gonna do anything, you know,
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:08.420]   you're not gonna do any heavy lifting with that.
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:11.060]   How many of us live our lives with spiritual clothing
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:15.640]   that actually hinders us from the battle
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.360]   that he called us to?
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.700]   So first and foremost, he said, put on the proper shoes,
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:24.220]   commit, get ready, make this your goal.
[00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.060]   And then, today, I wanna spend some time
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.820]   talking about the defensive armor.
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.660]   First, get yourself ready, are you committed to this?
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:34.460]   And if you're not committed to this,
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:38.780]   then anything I say from this pulpit is just time.
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:42.780]   You've committed, you signed a covenant, a lot of you,
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.620]   and so because you've got a covenant,
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:48.260]   you're gonna have to, you've given me exactly 40 minutes,
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.940]   45 minutes to speak, so anything that goes over that,
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:55.540]   you've robbed my time, my life, right?
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.340]   Because what I'm saying to you
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:58.460]   doesn't have any kind of value
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.860]   because you're not committed, right?
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:04.420]   Things I say here is like reading instructions
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.060]   and putting IKEA furniture together,
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.580]   but you don't have the furniture to put together.
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:11.460]   You didn't buy anything.
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.160]   So the Word of God just becomes empty words,
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.780]   or just something to puff you up,
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:16.900]   the more knowledge that you have.
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:20.980]   I know how to, if I want to, but it's not being applied.
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:24.420]   So if you have truth, but you're not girding your life
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.980]   with truth, you're just in a fashion show
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:30.620]   to show other people what you know.
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.020]   He says to gird up your loins, put up the proper shoes,
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.140]   and make sure that you're committed to this,
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:37.300]   and when you are committed for the battle,
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.900]   he says there's three things that he tells us
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:41.380]   for defensive armor, right?
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.420]   If you're going into battle and you're only gonna do
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:46.080]   offense, you don't need any of this, right?
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.860]   All you need is a sword, what it's gonna cut,
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:52.560]   but because we have an enemy that is attacking us,
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.580]   you put on the defensive armor,
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:56.280]   and the three defensive armor that he says
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.960]   is the breastplate of righteousness,
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.720]   the shield of faith, and helmet of salvation.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:04.180]   And this is because putting these things on
[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:07.160]   is a recognition that we have an enemy,
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.560]   like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.080]   And let me ask you this morning,
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.780]   were you aware that you were being attacked this week?
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:21.840]   Were you aware that Satan is using
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.280]   whatever circumcision, whatever pride,
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:27.060]   whatever compromises that you may have in your life,
[00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:31.340]   and he's constantly scheming to drive you away from God?
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.840]   Do you know that that actually happened this week?
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.700]   That there was an attack on your conscience,
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:38.660]   there was an attack on your life,
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.940]   on your time, on the money,
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.860]   so that whatever decision you're making,
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.080]   however you're spending your time,
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.900]   is either bringing you to God,
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.100]   or causing you to drift away from God,
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.140]   that our enemy is constantly scheming
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:52.460]   to keep you away from him.
[00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:53.980]   Were you even aware of that?
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:59.720]   See, this defensive armor you put on,
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.200]   knowing that the attacks are gonna come.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:05.380]   First thing that he says is,
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:08.060]   put on the breastplate of righteousness.
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.900]   I mean, obviously, you put on the breastplate
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.420]   of righteousness because it protects your vital organs,
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:16.980]   your lungs, your heart, and the other parts of your body,
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:20.620]   where if a sword comes in punctured, you're gonna die.
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:21.940]   So he says, first and foremost,
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:25.540]   put on the breastplate of righteousness.
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:28.140]   Now, when he says to put on the breastplate of righteousness,
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:30.560]   the obvious question that we have to ask is,
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:35.100]   is he talking about justification or sanctification, right?
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:38.760]   Is he saying, be reminded that you are righteous before God,
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.980]   don't let Satan attack you,
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.480]   and to question your righteousness,
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.220]   because he has covered you with his blood,
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.540]   and so that you have become righteous,
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:49.840]   so Satan can't attack you.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.580]   Is that what he is saying, or is he saying
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:56.460]   that you need to live a righteous life, live a holy life,
[00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:59.980]   and to protect yourself so that Satan can't attack you?
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:00.880]   Which one is it?
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.460]   Okay, don't answer it.
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:05.540]   I just want you to think about it, right?
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:11.520]   The right answer to that, in my opinion, is both.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:15.080]   You know, in our culture,
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.060]   the way that the Bible sometimes is taught,
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.520]   that we make such a clear distinction
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.480]   between justification, sanctification, and glorification,
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.920]   that oftentimes, a lot of Christians
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.280]   think those are separate things.
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:29.360]   I'm justified, but I'm not being sanctified, right?
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.000]   I will be glorified, but I'm not absolutely sure
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.320]   about the middle process.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.840]   The reason why I say it's both
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:39.120]   is because you cannot have justification
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.060]   when there is no sanctification.
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:45.560]   The whole purpose of why God made us righteous
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.600]   is so that we can live righteously.
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:53.120]   He delivered us from the penalty of sin
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:57.040]   so that we would become, what?
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.800]   Slaves to righteousness.
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:03.100]   That's what the scripture says in Romans chapter six.
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:06.240]   So you cannot have one without the other.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.000]   So when the question is that when you,
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.120]   we're supposed to wear the breastplate of righteousness.
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.440]   Is it just talking about, you know, I'm saved, always saved,
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:14.720]   there's nothing I can do to please God,
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.240]   so what I do, sanctification, doesn't matter?
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.480]   Absolutely not.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.620]   The Bible never separates these two things.
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.520]   It's the two side of the same coin.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:30.080]   He declared us righteous so that we may live righteously.
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:33.120]   So when he says to put on the breastplate of righteousness,
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.840]   he's talking about both.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:41.500]   Nothing nullifies the quality of our prayers
[00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:44.560]   than having an unclear conscience.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:50.560]   We need to have a clear conscience
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.960]   so that we can be protected by the enemy's attack.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.720]   In First Timothy three two, it says,
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.880]   an overseer then must be above reproach,
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.960]   the husband of one wife, temperate, prudent,
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.200]   respectable, hospitable, able to teach.
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:06.080]   The first thing, the qualification of an elder or a deacon
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.800]   is he must be above reproach.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:11.260]   Now above reproach, we think, well, who's perfect?
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:13.640]   Who's gonna qualify for this, right?
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.720]   How many of you are perfect?
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:18.680]   Is he saying that you need to be perfect, right?
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:19.900]   Because that's what it seems like.
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:21.600]   If you're not perfect, you can't be an elder,
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:22.880]   and obviously we're perfect,
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:25.000]   and that's why we became elders, right?
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.780]   We don't have any faults.
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:28.000]   We don't have anything.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.660]   This word is much more nuanced than that.
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:34.480]   To be above reproach means that if somebody
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.840]   wanted to attack you, there's nothing obvious
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.360]   that they're going to accuse you of
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.540]   to nullify you of your witness.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.920]   Because the job of an elder
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:49.000]   is to speak truth into darkness,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.680]   the darkness is going to speak back.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:55.200]   They don't like it, right?
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:56.080]   And because they don't like me,
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.480]   the easiest thing to do is nullify the preacher.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.800]   How can I take you seriously when your life is like this,
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.800]   when you do this, and this is what you do with your life?
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.520]   And so he says, in order to be able
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.160]   to handle the word of God, you must be above reproach
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:13.360]   because the enemy is going to attack.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.480]   And if you have obvious things that you are doing in life
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.680]   that you're going to speak into other people's lives
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.360]   and say, you should do this, you shouldn't do this,
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.740]   and the first thing that people who don't want to hear it
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.840]   are going to say is, what about you?
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.520]   What about you?
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.840]   So what he's saying is, in order to be able
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:34.840]   to engage in spiritual battle, you must be above reproach.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.400]   Now, is it just elders?
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.800]   No, 1 Peter 2.12 said,
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:41.240]   keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:45.080]   so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers,
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.560]   they may because of your good deeds,
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.800]   as they observe them, glorify God in the day of visitation.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:54.380]   When you begin to speak truth into the life of unbelievers,
[00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.280]   and they don't like what you're saying,
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:58.100]   and they want to nullify you,
[00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:00.720]   and they have obvious things that they're going to point out,
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.560]   your message, the gospel, is going to be
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.960]   immediately nullified, at least in their eyes.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:08.000]   So he says, when the devil wants to attack,
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.280]   because we're going into his territory,
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:13.360]   he says, to put on the breastplate of righteousness.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:17.460]   Remember, Satan's stronghold is in this world,
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:22.320]   and Satan is called the accuser of the brethren,
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:25.020]   and he's going to constantly accuse you.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:28.040]   Any aspect of your life where your conscience is not clear,
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:32.320]   he's going to accuse you, and nothing weakens our prayer
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:35.400]   more than a conscience that is not clear.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.360]   It keeps us away from God.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:43.120]   A perfect example is that you see the disciples.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.800]   Jesus is headed toward the cross,
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:49.440]   and he keeps repeatedly telling them, making it clear.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:50.920]   He's headed toward the cross.
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:52.200]   He's going to die.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.240]   He's going to be crucified.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.600]   And yet, remember what the disciples
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.680]   were constantly arguing?
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.200]   Glory.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.040]   Who's going to sit on the left?
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:00.980]   Who's going to sit on the right?
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:03.600]   Even though Jesus made it absolutely crystal clear.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.320]   So right before he goes to the cross,
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:08.240]   Jesus says, Satan has asked to sift you like wheat,
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:12.520]   but I pray that you would be able to withstand his attack.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:16.060]   You know where Satan attacked the disciples?
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:19.400]   Satan attacked the disciples
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:22.360]   because they were seeking their own glory, own honor.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:26.220]   So when Jesus was going to the cross, it didn't make sense.
[00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:29.000]   I mean, we followed you.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.680]   We sacrificed everything to follow you
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.800]   because we thought that if we followed you,
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.520]   that we're going to be glorified.
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:39.280]   But then Jesus is talking nonsense.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.480]   Going to the cross, dying?
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:44.160]   Even though he said it, they didn't hear it
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:47.440]   because their hearts were filled
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:50.820]   with seeking their own glory.
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:53.440]   And so when Jesus is going to the cross,
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.320]   they're like, what?
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.540]   What is going on?
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:59.160]   Even though he said it repeatedly over and over again.
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.760]   And you know where this gets manifested
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:03.840]   besides the fact that they didn't understand
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:06.000]   when they were praying?
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:10.760]   Remember, after supper, Jesus takes them to the Gethsemane
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.240]   and he's agonizing in prayer
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.880]   because he knows what's going to happen in the morning.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:17.800]   And he takes his disciples with him and asks them to pray.
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.360]   And each time he comes back, they've fallen asleep.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.920]   And Jesus is irritated.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:26.000]   He's frustrated because these are his closest companions.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.360]   And he's in the middle of such agony.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:33.280]   And yet every time he comes, they're just conked out.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:36.240]   Now, humanly speaking, humanly speaking,
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.960]   we said, well, they just had a fat meal.
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:41.000]   They just had probably the biggest meal of the year,
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.240]   the Passover meal, right?
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:46.120]   And they all probably gorged themselves.
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:49.300]   And after that, this is in the middle of the night.
[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:50.860]   You know, I don't know if you've ever tried praying
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:52.000]   at two or three in the morning.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.480]   It's not easy, right?
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.600]   I remember early on when I became a Christian,
[00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:59.680]   we used to go and pray and they used to pray
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:01.700]   till two, three in the morning.
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:05.120]   And almost every night I fell asleep, almost every night.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.280]   We would hear people snoring, but the pastor would tell us,
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:11.440]   you know, go to the bathroom and put water in your face.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.440]   And so we endured, we endured through the praying.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:17.680]   So I look at them and say, yeah, that looks like me, right?
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:18.800]   They just had a fat meal.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:19.840]   It's in the middle of the night.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.600]   Of course they're going to fall asleep.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:26.360]   It would make sense if you didn't understand the context.
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:32.260]   See, normally you can understand in time of peace,
[00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:33.300]   they just had a fat meal.
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:34.580]   Of course they're supposed to be sleeping.
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:36.140]   Of course they're going to be falling asleep.
[00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:38.780]   But remember, Jesus told them that he's going to die.
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:42.500]   That in a few hours, he's going to be tortured.
[00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:43.860]   He's going to be put on the cross.
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:46.820]   He's going to, for their sins.
[00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:49.740]   How many of you would have a good night's sleep
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:52.180]   if you knew torture was coming next morning?
[00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:55.380]   Some of you can't even sleep
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:57.680]   because the wedding day's the next day, right?
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:01.060]   See, in the human context, we may look at them and say,
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:02.980]   of course they can't be up.
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:05.780]   Of course they're not going to be praying fervently.
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:07.780]   It's because they didn't understand.
[00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:11.140]   It's because they didn't hear.
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:13.940]   And it's because they thought
[00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:18.740]   that what they were selflessly desiring may happen.
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:23.140]   And as a result of that, there was no urgency.
[00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:24.980]   There was no desperation.
[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:29.540]   So Jesus' frustration isn't simply that they weren't praying.
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.700]   It's that they just didn't understand
[00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:36.900]   how desperate of a situation that they were in,
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:39.460]   why they were able to relax.
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:44.660]   Nothing affects our prayer life more
[00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:48.260]   when we are spiritually not sober.
[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:51.700]   When our mind is filled with things
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.060]   that have nothing to do with God,
[00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.300]   whether it is compromise,
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:59.860]   whether it's just pleasure, just comfort and peace,
[00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:03.300]   nothing affects fervent prayer more
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:09.460]   than a life that is continually lived in unrighteousness.
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:13.060]   That's why he says to put on the breastplate of righteousness
[00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:15.300]   because Satan is going to attack.
[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:17.460]   Secondly, he says to put on the shield of faith,
[00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:19.460]   the shield of faith.
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:20.980]   The shield is something that you wield
[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:22.580]   when the attacks are coming, right?
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:24.100]   You don't use that for offense.
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:26.580]   You use that for defense because of the attacks coming.
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:31.460]   He says in order to withstand the flaming arrows of the devil,
[00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:34.820]   1 Peter 5, 8-9, "Be of sober spirit.
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:35.540]   "Be on the alert.
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:37.700]   "Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion,
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:38.980]   "seeking someone to devour,
[00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:41.940]   "but resist him firm in your," what, "faith."
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:46.020]   If you're going to resist the devil's attack,
[00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:48.580]   he says you must have a firm grasp of your faith.
[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:51.380]   1 Corinthians 16, 13, "Be on the alert.
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:53.220]   "Stand firm in the faith.
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:54.500]   "Act like men.
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:55.220]   "Be strong."
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:59.060]   So if the enemy's attacking you,
[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:01.460]   these flaming fires are coming at you,
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:03.140]   what are these flaming fires?
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:06.020]   What are the attacks that come?
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:08.820]   I mean, you have to understand the whole purpose
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:11.060]   of satanic attack is to keep you away from God.
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:13.060]   If you're not a Christian,
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.100]   he blinds you so that you do not understand
[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.700]   the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:18.580]   But if you're a Christian,
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:21.540]   that he will bring stumbling blocks to your life
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:25.540]   in order to prevent you from passionately pursuing God.
[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:28.340]   I think in our generation where you and I live,
[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:31.620]   ease and comfort is the primary attack.
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:35.940]   We are so afraid that if we make certain decisions
[00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:37.460]   that we're not going to be able to live
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:39.380]   the standard of life that you and I
[00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:41.060]   have become comfortable and would desire.
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:43.860]   And out of fear of losing that,
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.860]   we will not make certain decisions.
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:48.500]   We will not go certain places.
[00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:51.620]   We will not open our mouth to certain people
[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:55.460]   because of course God wants us to be comfortable.
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:58.580]   Of course God wants us to be wealthy and strong,
[00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:01.460]   even though we say we're those false prophets,
[00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:03.220]   the health and wealth gospel people,
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:04.580]   these people with weird hair.
[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:07.140]   We're not like them.
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:12.020]   Yet if we're carefully examining
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:14.340]   how much of the decisions that we make
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:16.980]   is because we've come to the conclusion
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:20.340]   that when God blesses us, we get good things.
[00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:24.340]   And when God doesn't bless us, we get bad things.
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:28.820]   He says to stand firm because he will attack.
[00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:32.180]   His primary attack is to keep you away from God,
[00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:33.380]   whatever that may be.
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:35.940]   The two primary things that I have noticed
[00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:37.940]   that causes people to come away from God
[00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:40.740]   is one, is your pride.
[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:44.820]   That's why Jesus says rich people,
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:46.740]   it's hard for them to enter the kingdom of heaven
[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:49.140]   because we are capable.
[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:52.100]   Even the way we do evangelism,
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:53.460]   even the way we plant churches,
[00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:57.700]   we have 15 training sessions, books to read,
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:59.220]   how to do that, how to organize.
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:02.100]   You need to have a critical core of 30.
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.580]   You need to have this much money, this kind of budget.
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:06.660]   You need to locate where the need is,
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:09.780]   market yourself, brand yourself,
[00:57:09.780 --> 00:57:12.180]   preach this way, organize your sermon this way.
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:14.900]   And so we have come to this system and training people.
[00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:18.100]   If you follow these directives that we found to work
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:21.700]   and you apply it, the chances of your success
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:23.460]   is gonna be much greater than if you don't.
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:30.180]   And yet through all of that training, there's no prayer.
[00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:33.060]   There's no dependence.
[00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:35.940]   There's no crying out.
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:38.340]   There's no miracles happening.
[00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:42.180]   It's just us applying ourselves and being smart.
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:43.860]   Even the way we do evangelism,
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:47.140]   even the way we plant churches, it's us.
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:49.700]   When the scripture clearly says
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:52.180]   you cannot bear fruit unless you abide in me.
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:59.460]   The way that Satan throws his arrows
[00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:02.420]   is keep you confident in yourself.
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:05.940]   Every day that we live without prayer,
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:08.180]   even though you may not articulate it this way,
[00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:08.980]   I don't need him.
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:11.860]   I want him, but I don't need him.
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:14.260]   If you need him, you will pray.
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:17.940]   If you need him, you will pray.
[00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:20.580]   When something desperate happens in your life, you will pray.
[00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:22.980]   When somebody gets sick and no amount of medicine
[00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:24.980]   can fix that person, you will pray.
[00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:27.460]   If you lose your job and you can't pay your bills,
[00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:28.180]   you will pray.
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:31.380]   But when it comes to spiritual matters,
[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:34.100]   somehow we think if we just apply ourselves,
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:36.020]   we can make this happen.
[00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:42.580]   One way that we are attacked is to keep you proud.
[00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:43.780]   Not humbled.
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:47.060]   The second way that you get attacked
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:51.780]   is that Satan will constantly accuse you of your wrongdoing.
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:54.260]   You're gonna fight with your wife.
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:58.420]   Maybe you cheated on something
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:58:59.620]   that you shouldn't have cheated on.
[00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:02.260]   Maybe there's a sin in your life
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:04.340]   that you keep regurgitating over and over again.
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:09.140]   And somehow you think that you have exhausted his grace.
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:14.260]   And it keeps you away from God.
[00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:15.060]   I can come to church.
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:15.940]   I can study the Bible.
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:20.100]   You know what's interesting is I've heard people say,
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:22.500]   "A prayer is so easy."
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:25.700]   You know, like, you know, the Bible, you gotta open it up.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:26.900]   You gotta learn hermeneutics.
[00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:27.620]   You have to dissect.
[00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:28.900]   You have to understand the context.
[00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:29.860]   And you gotta do all this stuff.
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:31.460]   Prayer, just open your eyes and talk.
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:32.180]   What's up, God?
[00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:34.020]   So easy.
[00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:36.500]   You're lying on your bed.
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:38.980]   You get up, putting your clothes on, brushing your teeth.
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:39.780]   What's up, God?
[00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:40.420]   It's so easy.
[00:59:40.420 --> 00:59:44.580]   I've heard people talk about prayer as so casual.
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:47.380]   I mean, one of the best sermons that I heard
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:50.180]   on this topic of prayer is from Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:53.380]   And he said, "Prayer is the most difficult discipline
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:56.580]   "of any Christian because once he recognizes
[00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:57.860]   "who he's talking to,
[00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:01.860]   "you cannot casually come before God."
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:05.540]   He's the creator of the universe.
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:07.860]   He's the one who could snap of a finger, destroy.
[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:11.220]   Destroy the world.
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:14.740]   He's a holy, holy, holy God.
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:17.620]   This is a God that people can't even look at and live.
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:20.340]   And it's that God that we are praying to.
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:23.780]   You don't go to him casually, your heart filled with sin
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.140]   and your conscience bothering you.
[01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:31.380]   He says, "No, prayer forces us to examine our hearts.
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:36.420]   "Prayer forces us to see if we're living a sinful life.
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:40.660]   "There's nothing that will hinder your Christian life
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.300]   "more than a bothered conscience."
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:49.140]   Some of you, because of your sins, you think,
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:51.940]   "You know, I'm gonna get myself right before I go to God."
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:55.620]   No, God says to come to him so that you can be right.
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:01:00.020]   So it humbles the proud and it encourages the weak.
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:02.420]   That's the gospel.
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:05.460]   That any of you who is proud, you think you can do it,
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:06.820]   God will humble you.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:09.460]   And any of you who you think have maybe crossed the line,
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:13.940]   say God invites you to come to restore you.
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:18.500]   And it's the same path, whether you're rich or poor,
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.340]   male or female, Jew or Gentile,
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:24.020]   well-educated or uneducated, disciplined or undisciplined,
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:28.100]   it is the same door that we go through to meet Christ.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:32.020]   And as soon as there's unrighteousness in your life,
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:36.020]   Satan will put his foot, his knee on your neck
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:37.140]   and squeeze you.
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:39.140]   You cannot go to him, you cannot go to him.
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:45.860]   It is by faith, it is the shield of faith says,
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:47.780]   "I don't go to him because of my righteousness.
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:49.940]   "I go to him because of his righteousness
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:53.300]   "and I'm gonna live my life to honor and glorify him."
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:59.620]   One of my favorite quotes from Corrie Ten Boom,
[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:01.860]   and I'm sure you've heard me say this before,
[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:04.580]   "There is no darkness that Satan can create
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.420]   "that the love of God cannot penetrate."
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:12.660]   There is no darkness that Satan can create
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:15.620]   that the love of God cannot penetrate.
[01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:18.740]   So the gospel humbles us
[01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:21.540]   and it lifts us up at the same time
[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.820]   and it invites us to him.
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:26.420]   You know, if you've ever raised children,
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:28.260]   especially teenagers, right?
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.340]   And some of you may be in the thick of things right now,
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:31.940]   right, if you have teenagers,
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:36.020]   you know how much God is using your teenagers
[01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:42.180]   to stretch, to see how far you will go
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:43.780]   to love your child, right?
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:45.620]   Even though in your heart you're like,
[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:46.820]   "This kid, this kid."
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:49.620]   But let me ask you a question.
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:53.060]   Is there a line in your head that you have drawn
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:55.220]   that if this kid crosses that line,
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:58.180]   that you've decided, "I'm gonna disown this kid."
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:01.940]   Is there a line that you have drawn in your heart,
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:04.020]   "If he does this one more time,
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.300]   "I'm gonna kick him out of the house,
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:08.260]   "I'm gonna change his name, right?
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:09.780]   "I'm gonna take away everything he has
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:11.460]   "and he's no longer gonna be my son.
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:12.980]   "I'm gonna go to the recording office
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:13.780]   "and change his name."
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:15.860]   You're on your own, right?
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:17.540]   I've had it 13 years enough.
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:20.340]   Is there a line that you have drawn
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:23.460]   that your child, I'm talking about your child,
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:28.580]   that you're not gonna endure beyond that?
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:30.920]   No.
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.220]   I don't know any parent
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:36.260]   who consciously makes that decision.
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:39.220]   And God will, some of us,
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:40.980]   stretch us to the limit
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:43.060]   beyond what you thought you were capable of.
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:45.620]   And it will force you to pray.
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:48.180]   It will test your patience.
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:51.860]   But yet, at the end of all that,
[01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:52.980]   you cannot give up.
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:55.300]   You can't.
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:56.820]   As much as you want to give up,
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.900]   as much as everything inside of you
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:00.180]   says that this is not right,
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:02.100]   you will not give up.
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.740]   Because that's your child.
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:10.100]   He who did not spare his own son,
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:13.140]   how will he not, along with him,
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:14.180]   give us all things?
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:17.860]   See, if we don't have the shield of faith,
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:20.180]   every mistake you make,
[01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:23.140]   Satan is going to throw his arrows.
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:24.740]   You're not deserving.
[01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:26.340]   You can't come.
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:28.340]   Get it right first before you come.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.660]   Become righteous before you come.
[01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:31.620]   No, he says, come to me
[01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:32.900]   so that you may be righteous.
[01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:35.940]   Finally, he says,
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:38.180]   you have to wear the helmet of salvation.
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:40.260]   Helmet of salvation.
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:43.060]   You cannot engage in spiritual battle
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:45.060]   if you're not certain about your salvation.
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:48.820]   You know what's really interesting?
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:50.340]   Is that if you study 1 John,
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:53.860]   the whole book of 1 John
[01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.580]   is addressing this issue
[01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:58.020]   of people who are living in sin.
[01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.860]   They said, you know what?
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:03.780]   Because we're saved in the spirit,
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:04.980]   you can do whatever with your body.
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:06.980]   And that was the Christian Gnostic teaching,
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:08.660]   the false gospel that was being taught.
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:10.340]   And so John, Apostle John,
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:11.380]   is addressing this issue.
[01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:13.300]   And he says, this is what a Christian looks like.
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:14.820]   And this is what a non-Christian looks like.
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:16.980]   So it starts out in chapter one by saying,
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:19.220]   if you're living in sin, living in darkness,
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:20.260]   don't say you're living in light
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:22.340]   because God is light and there's no darkness in Him.
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:23.460]   And you're fooling yourself.
[01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:29.940]   But he also says a Christian struggles with sin, right?
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:31.380]   Because we're in this flesh
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:33.380]   that we're going to need to constantly come to Him
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:34.900]   and ask for forgiveness.
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:36.740]   And he who says he doesn't have sin,
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:38.020]   you make him out to be a liar.
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:41.940]   So he spends four or five chapters describing,
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:43.540]   this is a Christian, this is a non-Christian.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.700]   So if you ever really want to know
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:46.500]   what a Christian looks like,
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.700]   what a non-Christian looks like,
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:48.820]   go through 1 John.
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.740]   But you know what's interesting?
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:54.580]   At the end of that letter in chapter five,
[01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:57.620]   he says, I am writing these things to you
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:01.220]   so that you may know that you have eternal life.
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:05.300]   In other words, I wrote all this to you
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:07.540]   so that you have assurance of your salvation.
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:10.580]   But why did he go through four or five chapters
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:12.500]   of telling them who's a Christian and non-Christian
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:14.580]   if at chapter five, he was going to say,
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:16.500]   I'm writing this all, I'm shaking you up
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.060]   so that the end conclusion is
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.900]   that you would have confidence
[01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:22.180]   where you stand before God.
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:26.580]   You see, that letter is written to Christians
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:27.220]   in the church
[01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:30.580]   because non-Christians wouldn't read that letter.
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:33.300]   Non-Christians could care less
[01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:34.740]   because they don't believe.
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.660]   If I say this is a Christian who's a non-Christian
[01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:39.300]   and you genuinely don't believe,
[01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:40.020]   you wouldn't care.
[01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:42.900]   You wouldn't care what I'm saying
[01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:44.900]   because it's not relevant to you.
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:47.940]   Only a Christian would be disturbed.
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:52.420]   Only a Christian would be shaken up.
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:54.420]   Is that true? Is that not true?
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:57.380]   But if you don't believe, I'm just talking.
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:58.740]   It's just noise coming out of my mouth.
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:06:59.780]   It's not relevant to you.
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:03.060]   He said the purpose of why he wrote this letter
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.820]   is to shake up the church
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:06.580]   so that those who have weak faith
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:08.580]   and those who are not certain
[01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:10.100]   that he would give him certainty.
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:12.660]   Know exactly where you stand
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:14.260]   and exactly what you're supposed to do
[01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:16.180]   and exactly what God is doing in your life
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:20.180]   because until your assurance of salvation is sure,
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:23.860]   you can't do anything with certainty.
[01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:26.980]   You can't read the Bible with certainty.
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:28.980]   You can't evangelize with certainty
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:31.380]   and you definitely will not pray with certainty.
[01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:34.820]   If you don't know where you stand with God,
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:37.380]   how will you talk to him?
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:40.660]   Am I talking to somebody who's angry with me?
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:43.140]   Am I talking to somebody
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:45.780]   who is compassionate and loving toward me?
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:48.740]   Am I talking to somebody who's trying to kill me?
[01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:50.740]   I mean, my conversation would look very different
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:53.220]   depending on who it is that I'm talking to.
[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:54.340]   The way I talk to my wife,
[01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:56.660]   the way I talk to my children maybe,
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:58.180]   the way I talk to a stranger,
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:00.340]   the way I talk to maybe somebody trying to harm me,
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:02.420]   that conversation is going to look very different
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:06.500]   until you have absolute certainty
[01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.860]   where you stand before God,
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:11.060]   the first place where you will be hindered is your prayer.
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:13.380]   Because you don't know how to talk to him.
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:16.660]   And that's why 1 John is written,
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:19.380]   so that they may know that they have eternal life,
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:20.660]   that you have a father
[01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:24.340]   who desires you to come to him.
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:26.420]   Book of Hebrews, he says,
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:27.460]   "He took on human form
[01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:29.460]   so that he may become a sympathetic high priest,
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:34.180]   so that we may enter the throne of grace with confidence."
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:38.100]   The whole reason why he came and saved us
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:40.260]   is not simply so that you won't have penalty of sin,
[01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:42.420]   but the penalty of sin washed away
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:44.500]   so that we may come to him with confidence.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:48.580]   But there's two things that we need to know about this throne.
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:49.780]   One, it is a throne.
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:51.780]   It is a king's throne.
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:54.980]   It's not a casual place that we're walking into.
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:56.580]   We're not walking into a restaurant.
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:58.980]   We're walking into the throne
[01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:00.660]   of the king of kings and lord of lords.
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:06.260]   So that's why prayer must be taken seriously
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:08.420]   with reverence and awe
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.940]   that we don't speak to God just out of the whim.
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:14.580]   That there must be a commitment to pray.
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:16.420]   But secondly, he said it is a throne,
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:18.100]   and though it is a throne,
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:19.780]   is a throne of grace.
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:24.100]   That this king desires us.
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:28.500]   And he even deposited his Holy Spirit in us.
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:31.860]   That when we have times of hardship,
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:34.820]   that he said it would groan on our behalf
[01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:36.580]   to draw us closer to God.
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:40.580]   The whole purpose of why the Holy Spirit is with us
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:41.780]   is to bring us to him.
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:46.820]   So if we don't know exactly where we stand before God,
[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:49.460]   the first thing that will be hindered is your prayer.
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:52.020]   Your conscience is not clear.
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:55.220]   You're not exactly sure
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:58.420]   exactly where you stand before God.
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:00.420]   And that's why we put on the helmet of salvation
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:02.820]   knowing in Romans 8, 38,
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.740]   "For I am convinced that neither death nor life
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.020]   "nor angels nor principalities
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.860]   "nor things present nor things to come
[01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:09.300]   "nor powers nor height nor depth
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:11.140]   "nor any other created things
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:13.700]   "will be able to separate us from the love of God."
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:18.900]   God is not asking us to pray
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:21.460]   so that you can check off, right?
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:24.180]   Check off and say, "That's what you're supposed to do.
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.100]   "A Christian's supposed to pray.
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:26.980]   "You're supposed to pray.
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:27.940]   "You have to pray."
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:28.820]   All this is true,
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:32.020]   but the underlying desire
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:33.380]   for God to bring us to him
[01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:35.460]   so that you may commune with him
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:40.180]   is a father telling his children to come,
[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:42.020]   "Ask me."
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:45.620]   He's not playing hide and seek.
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:48.820]   He's not telling his subjects,
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:50.820]   "Do what's right,"
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:54.340]   even though there is an element of that.
[01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:57.620]   But his primary call to himself
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:59.460]   is because he loves us.
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:03.540]   The cross makes no sense without God's love.
[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:07.380]   The cross makes no sense without God's love.
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:08.740]   If you take the love of God out,
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:11.060]   he is perfectly just to crush us.
[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:13.540]   Why would he go through all that drama?
[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:15.300]   Why would he make all those promises?
[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:17.220]   Why establish the nation of Israel
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:18.900]   and the prophets and the word of God
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:20.260]   and sending of the Holy Spirit,
[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:21.460]   establishment of the church,
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:23.780]   giving us the gospel?
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:24.900]   None of that makes sense
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:28.420]   if it isn't the love of God.
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:32.980]   So the more we understand the cross,
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:34.820]   the more we understand the depth of his love,
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:36.580]   and the more we understand the depth of his love,
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:39.620]   the more we understand why he came.
[01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:41.060]   He didn't just come simply
[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:42.500]   so that you would not be guilty.
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:45.540]   He took away our debt
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:48.420]   so that we can be reconciled to him.
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:53.060]   What kind of reconciliation would it be
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:56.020]   if you reconciled with your husband and wife
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.300]   and then you never talked to them?
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:00.500]   What kind of reconciliation would you be
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:02.900]   if you had a friend that you couldn't talk to
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:03.940]   because you wronged them
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:06.900]   and then you're forgiven and debt's forgiven
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:07.860]   and then you never talk to them?
[01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:09.460]   You say, "Oh, I'm glad we're good."
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:10.340]   And then you just go off
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:11.380]   and live your own personal life.
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:14.500]   The point of reconciliation
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:16.500]   is to restore the relationship.
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:21.060]   And that's why he tells us to pray,
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:23.060]   to come to him, to commune with him.
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:26.820]   Because the safest place for any Christian to be
[01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:28.580]   is at the center of his will,
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:30.980]   to commune with him, to know him,
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:32.260]   to love him, to worship him.
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:35.540]   Our salvation isn't simply going to heaven.
[01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:37.460]   Our salvation is God.
[01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:41.460]   I hope, let that sink in.
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:44.420]   Salvation is not simply not going to hell.
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:48.100]   Salvation is not a different destination when we die.
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:51.940]   Salvation is God himself.
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:55.780]   When we're reconciled to him,
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:56.900]   when we're living at his house,
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:57.940]   when we're communing with him,
[01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:59.620]   when we're communicating with him,
[01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:00.820]   when we're walking with him,
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:02.820]   when we're praying with him,
[01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:03.780]   that is salvation.
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:08.580]   Heaven is wherever God is.
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:12.420]   It's not a one location here
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:13.460]   and one location there,
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:14.580]   and then it just happens to be
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:15.940]   that's where God resides.
[01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:18.420]   No, wherever God is, is heaven.
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:24.180]   So the reason why we pray ultimately
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:26.660]   is because of salvation.
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:30.020]   Because that's the purpose of our salvation.
[01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:35.380]   So he says, "Therefore, put on the helmet of salvation."
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:36.820]   Let me conclude with this.
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:42.980]   If somebody asks you how you're doing spiritually
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:44.580]   and you say, "I'm doing okay."
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:46.260]   And then you say,
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:49.060]   "How about your prayer life?"
[01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:49.780]   "It's not good."
[01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:52.980]   You've contradicted yourself.
[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:57.460]   You cannot be good if you're not praying.
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:00.900]   You cannot be good if you're not praying.
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:05.780]   So it's dangerous for a Christian to feel good,
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:07.700]   that everything's good except for prayer.
[01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:10.980]   That's just like asking somebody,
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:11.700]   "How's your health?"
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:13.620]   It's like, "Everything's good, but I can't breathe."
[01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:17.220]   Everything is good.
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:19.620]   My bills are paid, my children are well.
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:22.500]   Everything is good, but I just can't breathe.
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.580]   Then you're not good.
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:26.820]   You're not good.
[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:31.380]   We can't be a church that focuses so much attention
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:32.340]   on the Word of God.
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:36.260]   It has so little priority in prayer.
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:38.420]   We have to pray.
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:40.100]   We have to pray.
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:42.660]   Word and prayer.
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:44.740]   It's not word or prayer.
[01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:47.380]   It's word and prayer.
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:50.820]   So I pray that as we focus,
[01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.660]   like I know there's probably a lot of things
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:54.020]   that you desire in 2024.
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:55.860]   I want to travel to this and I want to do that.
[01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:58.020]   But in the midst of all of that,
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:01.540]   the greatest priority, I pray this year,
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.540]   is to see where we're weak.
[01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.700]   And I believe that most of us will confess
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.540]   that this is a weakness in our life.
[01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:10.580]   To be committed, to be devoted to prayer.
[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:13.380]   That we are no longer just holding on
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:14.900]   to a form of godliness.
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:18.500]   That we're not studying the Bible as a fashion show,
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:21.220]   but that we would really understand
[01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:23.940]   and know the power of God through prayer.
[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:25.060]   Let's pray.
[01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:32.660]   (Praying)
[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:33.860]   Gracious and loving Father,
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:37.460]   we pray that you would help us to see
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:40.900]   how desperate we are without you.
[01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:44.660]   So that we may be men and women of prayer.
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:48.340]   As you've established this church, Lord God,
[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:52.420]   that we are called out to be prayer warriors.
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:54.100]   Not just to simply pray,
[01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:55.620]   but to be devoted to praying.
[01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:58.660]   Lord, teach us what that looks like.
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:15:59.860]   Teach us how to do that.
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:03.060]   Teach us to prioritize, Lord God, above everything else.
[01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:08.340]   That whatever fruit that we bear with our families,
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:09.940]   our children, our church,
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:15.460]   that is because your spirit is in the midst of us.
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:19.700]   So we ask you, we plead with you.
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:25.860]   Lead us, Lord God, to build a house of prayer.
[01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:27.540]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:35.140]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:50.580]   (Music)
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:51.220]   What a friend.
[01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:58.020]   What a friend we have in Jesus.
[01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:02.500]   All our sins and griefs to bear.
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:15.380]   What a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer.
[01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:23.380]   Oh, what peace we often forfeit.
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:28.180]   Oh, what needless pain we bear.
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:41.540]   All because we do not carry everything to God in prayer.
[01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:54.900]   (Music)
[01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:55.700]   Have we trials?
[01:17:56.660 --> 01:18:03.060]   Have we trials and temptations?
[01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:09.060]   Is there trouble anywhere?
[01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:15.060]   We should never be discouraged.
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:21.060]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:27.460]   Can we find a friend so faithful?
[01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:33.460]   Who will all our sorrows share?
[01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:39.460]   Jesus knows our every weakness.
[01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:45.460]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[01:18:45.460 --> 01:19:09.460]   (Music)
[01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:11.460]   Sing, are we weak?
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:19.860]   Are we weak and heavy laden?
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:26.260]   Cumbered with a load of care?
[01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:32.660]   Precious Savior, still our refuge.
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:39.060]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:45.460]   Do your friends despise, forsake you?
[01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:51.860]   Take it to the Lord in prayer.
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:58.260]   In His arms He'll shake and shield you.
[01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:04.660]   You will find a solace there.
[01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:22.260]   (Music)
[01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:28.660]   Heavenly Father, we pray that wherever you send your saints, that we would be the aroma of Christ.
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:30.660]   Help us, Lord God, to live soberly.
[01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:33.860]   That we may be aware of the unbelievers in our lives.
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:38.260]   That we may shed the light of Christ, His love that you've given to us.
[01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:43.860]   That we would be eager and sober and ready at all times, Lord God, in season and out of season.
[01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:46.660]   To make the gospel and the hope that we have in Christ clear.
[01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:51.860]   Help us, Lord God, to live in such a way where we are walking in the Spirit.
[01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:53.860]   That we may speak in the Spirit.
[01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:56.260]   That we may ultimately pray in the Spirit.
[01:20:56.260 --> 01:21:01.460]   Help us, Lord God, to know the power of Christ as we continue to engage in prayer.
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:05.060]   That we may see the arrows of the evil one.
[01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:08.260]   And to be able to shield ourselves, Lord God, with faith.
[01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:13.460]   To put on the breastplate of righteousness and the helmet of salvation.
[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:17.060]   Knowing, Father God, that it is your love that covers us.
[01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:22.260]   So we pray that you would help us, Lord God, wherever you send us.
[01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:24.660]   That we may bear fruit for your kingdom.
[01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:26.660]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:32.660]   God sent His Son.
[01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:38.660]   They called Him Jesus.
[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:48.660]   He came to love, heal and forgive.
[01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:58.660]   He lived and died to buy my pardon.
[01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:08.660]   An empty grave is there to keep my Savior's lips.
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:18.660]   Because He lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:28.660]   Because He lives, all fear is gone.
[01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:40.660]   Because I know He holds the future.
[01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:50.660]   And life is worth the living just because He lives.
[01:22:50.660 --> 01:23:02.660]   Worthy of every song we could ever sing.
[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:10.660]   Worthy of all the praise we could ever give.
[01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:16.660]   Worthy of every breath we could ever take.
