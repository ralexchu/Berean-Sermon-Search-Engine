[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160]   - Good evening, everybody.
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.080]   Glad we could tune in for another session of our Ephesians Bible study.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.960]   Let's take a moment to pray as we begin.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.640]   Our God, thank you, Lord, for your grace.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.440]   And God, we thank you that, Lord, your heart is kind and generous.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.760]   Lord, we recognize that throughout the book study, that, Lord, you have been overflowing
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.000]   with mercies, forgiveness, and love.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.040]   And what's more, God, that you have been absolutely generous with us.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.320]   And this not because of anything that we merit, but truly because this is the character of
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.660]   your heart.
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.000]   And so we thank you, God, for not only allowing us to see it, but God, to experientially receive
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.040]   it from your gracious hand.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.720]   We pray for another session of Bible study that as we study your word, God, that we would
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.280]   truly have eyes to see and ears to hear.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.720]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.160]   Okay, we're taking a look at Ephesians chapter four, verses seven through 10 today.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.040]   But as you take a look at the passage, you could easily tell that verses seven all the
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.880]   way down through verse 16 is one paragraph.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.800]   So let's take a moment to read that portion of scripture and we'll study the passage.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.760]   Ephesians four, verse seven, it says, "But to each one of us, grace was given according
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.720]   to the measure of Christ's gift.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.120]   Therefore it says, when he ascended on high, he led captive a host of captives and he gave
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.120]   gifts to men."
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.080]   Now this expression, he ascended, what does it mean except that he also had descended
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.600]   into the lower parts of the earth?
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.120]   He who descends is himself also he who ascends far above all the heavens so that he might
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.000]   fill all things.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.960]   Let's take a moment to read the rest of the paragraph.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.120]   "And he gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.120]   as pastors and teachers for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.080]   the building up of the body of Christ, until we all attained to the unity of the faith
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.360]   and the knowledge of the son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.200]   which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.280]   As a result, we are no longer to be children tossed here and there by waves and carried
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.740]   about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness and deceitful scheming.
[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.160]   But speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects and to him who is the
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.000]   head, even Christ, from whom the whole body being fitted and held together by what every
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.260]   joint supplies according to the proper working of each individual part, cause the growth
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.440]   of the body for the building up of itself in love."
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:55.680]   Okay, let's begin by taking a look at the very first verse of our passage, verse seven.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.960]   And this is a topic sentence for the paragraph.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.760]   It begins by saying, "But to each one of us, grace was given according to the measure of
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.760]   Christ's gift."
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.760]   Okay?
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.520]   Now, because it's a topic sentence, it's good to identify each element of this sentence.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.520]   Okay?
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.400]   So the very first thing we're going to identify is the contraction there, or conjunction there,
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   the word "but."
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.400]   Right?
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.200]   We ask this question, what is being contrasted?
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.080]   We ask the question, hmm, what is the summary of verse seven that is being juxtaposed against
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.480]   what was stated before?
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.480]   Okay?
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.280]   And what we noticed from before was that there was such unity.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.800]   If you recall, in verses one through six of chapter four, there was this repetition of
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.200]   the word "one."
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.880]   There was one this, and there was one that.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.520]   There was one body, there was one spirit.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.520]   Okay?
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.320]   There was one baptism, and so forth.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.200]   And so when we think about it, clearly there was an emphasis on the theme of unity.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.560]   Okay?
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:03.520]   And then here, in this sentence, in verse seven, it's stating, "But to each one of us," it
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.880]   is highlighting this idea of individuality within the body.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.880]   Okay?
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.840]   And so, one of the ways that a commentator, James Montgomery Boyce, states it, is that
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.480]   Apostle Paul takes great lengths to stress the unity of the church within this same thought,
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.800]   in a balanced thought.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.360]   Yet, it is a particular kind of unity.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.680]   It is a kind of unity that sustains great diversity.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.400]   So we have to keep in mind that there is a commonality, there is a unity by which there
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.320]   is sameness, right?
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.000]   There is a same baptism, same experience, I said, same identity.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Okay?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.320]   And so much so, it supersedes a lot of the differences that we may have.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.440]   But at the same time, God intentionally designed to preserve the individuality that he has
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.600]   created us to have.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.920]   And a good example of that, essentially, like the thumb.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.360]   If we were to think of ourselves each as individual thumbs, but the thing about it is, each of
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.240]   us has a fingerprint that is unique.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.520]   That is so unique that not a single person has the exact same fingerprint as another.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.600]   So another passage, a cross-reference to highlight this, is from a passage that should be familiar
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.280]   to every single one of you, because we go over it for every member's induction.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.280]   Okay?
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.120]   So please turn your Bibles over to 1 Corinthians 12 as we do a walkthrough.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.640]   Because this cross-reference highlights this idea in such extensive fashion.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:44.480]   This chapter is stressing the idea of incredible unity and diversity in the context of thinking
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.440]   about spiritual gifts, the practice and use of spiritual gifts within the church.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:56.820]   I want to start off with 1 Corinthians 12, verse 4-7, and the passage says this, "Now,
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.780]   there are varieties of gifts, but the same spirit.
[00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.000]   There are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.480]   There are varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things in all persons.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:15.240]   But to each one is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good."
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.620]   Okay?
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.160]   So what's the idea here?
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:26.020]   The idea is that there is such a variety of not only the work and function that we do,
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.320]   but the effect and the results that we have.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.140]   And what's more, by the spirit, okay, by the spirit, there is going to be a manifestation
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.760]   of different kinds of gifts for each person.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.440]   And so the idea there again is variety.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.760]   Verse 11, verse 11 going forward says this, "But one and the same spirit works all these
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.320]   things distributing to each one individually as he wills."
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.860]   So that being the case, one might say, "Wow, that's really interesting.
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.880]   This variety is not just because it's hard to get everybody to walk the same walk, get
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.120]   in line and do the same thing.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.760]   It's intentional, okay?
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.160]   The spirit gifts each person distributing as he desires."
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.580]   But someone might say, "But why?"
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.400]   One of the thoughts that I had was there was a time when after doing, let's say, a project
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.800]   together with different people at the church, there are times when I think like, "Man, it'd
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.880]   be nice to have a bunch of you."
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.200]   And that's a compliment, meaning, "I wish I could clone you because if I had a bunch
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.800]   of you, man, think about how much work we could have.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.760]   Think about how many things we can do, right?"
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:40.440]   And I'm sure if you've ever tried serving at church and you were trying to run a project,
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.360]   sometimes you might've felt the frustration like, "How come everybody doesn't do this?"
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:50.280]   Well, I want you to think about that because although yes, it would be nice to have a hundred
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:57.840]   of certain individuals, God is saying, "No, according to his own wisdom, he made it varied."
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:04.080]   Although it might seem a lot better to just have every single person synchronized, EVing
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.240]   together, working together, and then we could say proudly, "We are like a unit."
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.640]   Clearly, scripture says, "No, that's actually not the model."
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.440]   Moving forward in verse 12, it says, "For even as the body is one, yet has many members,
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.640]   and all the members of the body, though they are many, are one body.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.280]   So also is Christ."
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.880]   When I said earlier that that wasn't the design, think about what is the model.
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:37.080]   There is this very interesting and profound word here where he talks about how although
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.840]   there's one and there's many members, he says, "So is Christ."
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.840]   This is the way the design of the body of Christ is made.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.160]   Verse 13, "For by one spirit, we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks,
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.040]   whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one spirit.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.560]   For the body is not one member, but many."
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:01.680]   Also skipping down to verse 18, "But now God has placed the members, each one of them,
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.520]   in the body, just as he desired.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.580]   If they were all one member, where would the body be?
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:14.720]   But now there are many members, but one body, and therefore we have to hold these two, five,
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.400]   thoughts in unison and in balance."
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.920]   I want you to think about this.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.160]   Our Savior, is he varied?
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.360]   I think one of the very profound things about Christ is scripture says he is priest, he
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.200]   is king, he is prophet, he is the physician, he is...
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.140]   We can go on.
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.600]   He holds incredible offices.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.160]   And what's more, when we think about even the way that he presented his personalities,
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:52.280]   I mean, what a dynamic individual, where he is perhaps the most incredibly gentle, that
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:58.800]   the greatest of sinners, though shamed as they may be, would walk towards him.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.600]   Those individuals who are outcasts would find such comfort in Christ.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:09.400]   And yet at the same time, Christ is somebody who we can't even compare how scary he is,
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.800]   how fearsome his authority and power is.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.240]   To put it in another way, Christ is not a one-trick pony.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.200]   He doesn't do one thing over and over again, and then therefore he does that thing miraculously,
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.200]   but every...
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.200]   Like majestic, but everything else, it's like, "He left it to other people to take care of."
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.200]   No.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.400]   Christ is one, and we're going to talk about this, who fulfills all in all, and there's
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.800]   this incredible dynamic nature to our Savior.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.440]   And God had designed that his church, the body of Christ, be the same way.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.800]   Interesting, right?
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:47.480]   So those individuals who see church specifically as, "We should be a military boot camp and
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:54.840]   get people into shape," there may be aspects of discipline, exhortation, but that's not
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.640]   what we all are.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.940]   We need to be an infirmary.
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.780]   We need to be a hospital.
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:07.200]   There may be a need for that, but that's not all that the church is.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.120]   You guys get my drift there.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.680]   Moving forward, 1 Corinthians 12, verse 25, he says, "So that there may be no division
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.560]   in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another, and if one
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.920]   member suffers, all the members suffer with it.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.360]   If one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it."
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:30.240]   Now you are Christ's body and individually members of it, and God has appointed in the
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:35.320]   church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, the miracles and gifts of healing,
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:40.120]   helps administration, various kinds of tongues.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.600]   I just want to make mention of this fact then.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:51.960]   Sorry, hold on one second.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:58.720]   Make mention of this fact then that God has designed us varied.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:04.360]   God has designed us in a dynamic way to create even greater unity.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.280]   Now he asked this important question in verse 29, "All are not apostles, are they?"
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.160]   The answer is no.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.960]   There is diversity here.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.320]   Let's continue to read these questions that Apostle Paul poses.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.600]   He says, "All are not prophets, are they?
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.880]   All are not teachers, are they?"
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.880]   The answer is no.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.960]   "All are not workers of miracles, are they?"
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.960]   No.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.760]   "All do not have gifts of healing, do they?"
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.760]   No.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.760]   "All do not speak tongues, do they?"
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.760]   No, they do not.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.600]   "All do not interpret, do they?
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.120]   But earnestly desire the greater gifts."
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.640]   I will show you still a more excellent way.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:43.360]   And that leads into chapter 13, which talks about love as an incredible virtue, as a greater,
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.960]   higher superseding ethic than perhaps our intellect.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:56.120]   Now in summary then, earlier I mentioned to you that God has made things beautiful in
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.520]   the incredible unity that we have.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:05.760]   So much so that our unity supersedes all the categories of division that we see on earth.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:11.160]   Male, female, rich, poor, free, slave.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:16.720]   All these categories does not matter in the face of God because He has built such a unity,
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.720]   a beautiful unity and commonality in us.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:26.880]   At the same time, this unity contains a diversity that produces even greater unity and interdependence
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.400]   and ultimately brings glory to God.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.720]   When He said, "We are different.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.880]   And if we were the same, where would be the sense of smell?
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.880]   Where would be the..."
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:34.880]   Right?
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.640]   Those are the things that we remember from chapter 12.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:42.160]   And He said, "This kind of dynamic nature of the church actually creates a greater kind
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.400]   of interdependence on each other.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:51.160]   We give even greater honor to elements of our body that we think are just behind the
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.160]   scenes."
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.160]   Because why?
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.160]   We need them.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.400]   And we're not able to say, "I don't need you."
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.240]   So in God's great wisdom, He has created all that.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.880]   And someone listening might say, "Yeah, last time, the last Bible study that I gave last
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.680]   week, I played up the unity so much.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.280]   I was just like, 'We have everything in common.'"
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.280]   Right?
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.840]   And I pretty much said, "Who cares about your personality?
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.240]   I don't really care if you're an INTJ or whatever letters you may be."
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.240]   Right?
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:26.440]   So in balance, just as a caveat, what I'm saying actually is your Myers-Briggs personality
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.880]   test just doesn't matter as much.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.400]   But it's not as though your personality is done away with.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.560]   It's not as though you have to go and kill your personality and fake like you're something
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.560]   else.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.560]   No.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.640]   All of that is preserved and used as unique gifts that we're going to continue to think
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.640]   about.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.720]   So, significantly speaking, every single member, we are many.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.960]   And we are different.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.120]   And we are all significant parts that God has composed together into this beautiful
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.080]   thing that God is desiring to make, which is His church, the body of Christ.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.080]   Okay?
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.840]   I hope that just makes you feel like, "Man, the church is awesome."
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.840]   Right?
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.560]   Not because we've made the church awesome because God has clearly designed it and gifted
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.560]   it that way.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.240]   Now, moving forward to section B. Okay?
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.320]   Section number two, 7B.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.520]   It says, "According to the measure of Christ's gift."
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.600]   Now, we have to ask this question, okay?
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.800]   What is this gift, this Christ's gift?
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.440]   And when he says, "According to the measure," how is it measured out?
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.560]   What kind of measure are we talking about?
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.320]   Now, there are elements that we won't take extra time on.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:40.360]   But when you even think about "of Christ's gift," when we say "Christ's gift," I think
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.560]   we naturally would read it.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:48.680]   This is a gift that maybe Christ is measuring out in His generosity and giving out.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.040]   So this is Christ's gift to give to you.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:57.920]   Or another commentator just kind of gave us some options and said, "What if this is more
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:06.680]   like the gifts that Christ received as the Savior, as the Son of God, as the King, to
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.040]   that great measure Christ gives?"
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.040]   Now, I'm just going to skip that part and leave that to you to dwell on.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.480]   Either way you think about it, the measure is incredible.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:21.280]   The measure by which Christ is giving the gifts to the church is not the kind of way
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.040]   that perhaps we would measure it out.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:30.040]   I mean, again, because we are in this scenario of people needing personal protection equipment
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.480]   like masks, and like, "How do I divvy this out?"
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:38.800]   Well, I guess you need it, so sometimes you think like generosity should happen just when
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.280]   there is a dire, dire need here.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.360]   Is that the way Christ is going to give gifts?
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.920]   Perhaps not, right?
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:52.000]   Now, in thinking about this though, A, there is clearly some indication of what kind of
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.120]   gifts Paul's talking about because he uses a specific term for gift, which is in the
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.920]   Greek, "dorea."
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.000]   This is a free gift.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:10.640]   And the dictionaries, when you do the word study, highlight that this term emphasizes
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.240]   the gracious nature of the character given it.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.600]   So basically the idea is freely.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.960]   This is a free thing, completely free of cost.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:25.080]   Now, when we think about this gift, it has a couple different references that can be,
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:29.320]   but when you do Bible study, I want you to make sure that you're always first thinking
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:33.760]   about it in the immediate context, meaning you should be thinking about it within the
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.200]   phrases around it.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.880]   You should be thinking about it within the paragraph that it belongs to.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:45.160]   What's very interesting is that in the immediate context, the gifts, one of the definitions
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:51.520]   that we can assign to this idea of gift is people.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:58.960]   Christ gives the church people, individuals, apostles, prophets.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.920]   Now I'm going to be just really frank with you guys.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:09.480]   The people that I consider to be incredibly huge facets of God's grace to me are individuals
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.520]   who have invested and taught me.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.120]   I mean, I've always said to you guys that although I am a part of the leadership and
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:21.320]   have been now for a decade, I see all of our elders like they're my elders, right?
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.840]   Because they've guided me this whole time.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.280]   They've taught me, they've been patient with me, instructing me, guiding my steps.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.240]   What a huge gift that is, your parents.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.760]   I mean, think about again, the gifts that you receive when you think about the people,
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:42.840]   but what's more in broader context, as we think about later on in the paragraph, how
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:47.080]   we are supposed to be the saints who labor and do the work of ministry and how we're
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.800]   supposed to employ the things that we have.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.720]   Clearly both verse seven and then other portions of scripture, when we looked at 1 Corinthians
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:00.160]   chapter 12, think about gifts in terms of skills, functions, and enablements, usable
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:05.720]   traits that you can employ for the edification of the church.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:11.000]   So each of these gifts we're supposed to use, each of these gifts we're supposed to have
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.920]   the sense of like, oh yeah, we're not necessarily maybe visibly like a vital portion, right?
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.920]   Vital portion of the church, but nevertheless still so significant in the God has placed
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.520]   you there.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.800]   The church is strong.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:30.640]   The church is strong when each person fully ministers according to their gifting.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:36.200]   What's more in Acts chapter two, verse four, verse 33, I referenced that passage for you
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.200]   in your Bible study questions.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:44.720]   And we point to John chapter 14 when Christ talks about what he's going to give his disciples.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.720]   Okay.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.920]   What he's going to send, who he's going to send.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.880]   And what's very clear is that we have the Holy Spirit.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:56.560]   So in various parts of scripture, when he talks about the gift that is given to men
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.600]   in Acts chapter two, verse four, when it talks about the gift that is coming down, he's talking
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.800]   about the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.200]   So take a moment to think about this.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:11.320]   You know, one of the terms that I really don't have come to not like within just our common
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.560]   like use of language is the term layman.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.560]   Okay.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.560]   Layman.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:21.280]   You see this idea of specialized clergy, okay.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:27.160]   People of the cloth, so to speak, and laity has been a concept around us from a long time.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.600]   It has Catholic roots to it.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.320]   Laity just means commoner.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.320]   Okay.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.040]   But just the way that even sounds, I don't like it.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.520]   It just sounds so much like lazy, right?
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.520]   You just lay there.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.520]   Layman, right?
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.520]   Lame.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.520]   Okay.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.920]   So what I'm trying to say is that kind of differentiate, like the difference that you
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:54.760]   categorically make between clergy and layman, it shouldn't be so strict within like church
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.360]   hierarchy of the Catholic faith.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.280]   There has been Pope bishops, like Cardinals and whatnot.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.160]   And then at the bottom of the totem pole is laity.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.200]   But that actually made some kind of difference in terms of function.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:11.280]   They said that the laity, how could they understand scripture?
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.560]   Right?
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:18.400]   So I want you to think about the way that the passage is even talking about though the
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:25.160]   commoner, I guess you could say, you should be thinking of yourselves not as layman, but
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.760]   gifted people for ministry.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.140]   Right?
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:33.760]   There is a variety of gifts and a variety of effects that Christ is going to produce
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.400]   in you and the effects you don't even know yet.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:44.720]   You are every single person within the church gifted people, not lay.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.720]   Okay.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.520]   Although yes, we can, we can talk about that.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.700]   You're not in full-time ministry, right?
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.200]   You're not a staffer at the church.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.880]   We get that.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:58.080]   But obviously in terms of the mentality, we have to be thinking we have, and I want you
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:03.520]   to say you have, you have the Holy Spirit, you have special gifting, the uniqueness of
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:09.680]   your, your, your, your, uh, abilities, your capacities, your experiences, your personalities,
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:13.920]   your thought, and most importantly, just your faith.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.040]   And then what's more, you have people, you have people in the church around you, not
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:22.480]   just pastors and elders, but people around you who are teaching you and investing you
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.160]   don't act like you don't have stuff.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.640]   It is my point.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:31.160]   And you know that, you know, there are people I like to mention, you know, sometimes we
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:36.520]   don't even know, like they don't have visible character traits that are like apparently
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:41.480]   right immediately noticed, but we have people in this church who you may not even know what
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:47.320]   their voices sound like, but it have contributed so much to build up this church and that we're
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.040]   so thankful for.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.040]   Okay.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.600]   So that portion of it, we definitely want to really appreciate.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:59.560]   And then moving on to section three, verses eight through 10, we can clump together as
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.600]   a support clause and rationale.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.600]   Okay.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.840]   Verse seven, I spent a lot of time because that's the topic sentence.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:12.900]   Listen, we're all one, but each one of you have been gifted by Christ and that is a grace
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.460]   given to you.
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:19.880]   That's not a, you know, a task master, a task masters, you know, whip given to you.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:24.720]   That is, that is grace given to you to exercise such gifts.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.160]   And then it's a support of that concept is verse eight through 10, which reads, therefore,
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:33.720]   okay, it says when he ascended on high, he led captive a host of captives and he gave
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.720]   gifts to men.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.860]   Now this expression, he ascended.
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:37.860]   What does it mean?
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:42.080]   Except that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth.
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:47.600]   He who descended is himself also he who ascended far above all the heavens so that he might
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.120]   fill all, uh, he might fill all things.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.120]   Okay.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.440]   So we have to ask, what is this quote?
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.440]   Where's it from?
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.440]   What's its context?
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.440]   And most importantly, why is it being quoted?
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:02.080]   And I made mentioned earlier, it's being quoted to support this idea that Christ gave gifts.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.080]   Okay.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:09.120]   Now this verse in terms of the old Testament quote, what comes from Psalm chapter 68 verses
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.320]   17 through 18 and it reads the chariots of God's are myriads thousands upon thousands
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.480]   and the Lord is among them as at Mount Sinai in holiness.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.460]   You have ascended on high.
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.640]   You have led captives, your captives.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:27.880]   You have received gifts among men, even among the rebellious also that the Lord God may
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.120]   dwell there.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.120]   Okay.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:35.600]   Now when you think about the general thought and flow, if you read all of Psalm 68, it's
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:43.040]   going to read this kind of majestic, you ascended, you threw down, you conquered, you're victorious,
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.040]   that kind of thought.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.040]   Okay.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:50.840]   And so, uh, Spurgeon in his treasury of David says, this Psalm is of might.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:56.080]   It's a victory of God, a hymn of war and victory celebrating God's conquest and triumphant
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.640]   ascent.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:02.440]   And then if you tie to the, if you think about what is tied King David and what is tied to
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:07.000]   the historical events, this is most likely the idea of the representation of the arc
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   of the covenant.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.320]   When God leads with the arc of the covenant, the nation was victorious.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:20.820]   So with that said, the concept and the thought is when a King is victorious, he receives
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:21.820]   all the spoils.
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:28.680]   When a King is victorious, he comes back into the kingdom and with him comes what gifts.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.800]   Why?
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.240]   Because he's just conquered and taken in all of the spoil.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:37.920]   And so when you think about that, the way that we should be thinking about the measure,
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:44.280]   the way that we should be thinking about the kind of concept is a generosity of a King,
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.520]   okay, given to the church.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:50.520]   So I wanted to go down and break down a couple of things that you guys might have questions
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:54.280]   on and I'm going to go through this briefly, which is this.
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:58.800]   Apostle Paul highlights though, he doesn't specifically say the King is giving you gifts,
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.040]   but he highlights though, and you have to take note of this, the degree of descent and
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:07.960]   ascent, okay, the degree of the descent and then the ascent.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.880]   And then, so what he said is, when you think about this idea of he went up, what does it
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.000]   mean but that he came down?
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Okay.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.400]   Now people are going to have this idea or the question, what does it mean that he came
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:23.040]   down and where, what are these lower parts of the earth?
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:28.320]   Now a lot of people have different thoughts, whether it be first the incarnation, just
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:34.320]   simply coming down as a man, we know the distance between where Christ was, where in the beginning
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.440]   was the word and the word was with God, the word was God.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:44.480]   And then for him to come down to us as incarnate man, that would be an incredible descent.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.440]   What's more, some people will say, he's just talking about earth.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.420]   He came to earth and then he went to the grave into the lower parts.
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:55.280]   And then some people think that perhaps he's talking about Sheol, which is referenced a
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:00.000]   lot in the Old Testament, which is a place, a jail of the Old Testament for those who
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.720]   are demons, those who are opposed to God.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.920]   And first Peter chapter three mentions that when Christ is victorious through his death,
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.160]   that he preached to those who are in prison.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:18.960]   And the idea is that Christ preached his triumph and said, look, you shameful beings, look
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.880]   what I've done.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.200]   And then other people think he just literally spent time in hell.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.760]   This passage alone, it cannot give us enough to say, oh my gosh, it's all of these.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:37.760]   It's best to think just the significance is the descent of this King to come.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:43.920]   And this idea is in his coming was yes, his death and his suffering, but realize that
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:49.880]   it was through that, that Christ is going to also achieve his victory.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:55.100]   And so the question is, so then he went down and it's he who went up and to where?
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.480]   He who ascends far above all the heavens.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:04.760]   But the point that is the driving force and the conclusion is verse 10, so that he fulfills
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.760]   all things.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.200]   When you think about the idea of fulfills all things, we should be thinking about like
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.480]   the kind of terminology we read.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:18.680]   Remember like, you know, when back in revelation or sorry, the near revelation, when it talks
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:25.680]   about the savior, he'll say to him, be all things, glory, honor, power, right?
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:30.000]   That's to him, to him belongs everything.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.600]   They were talking about cosmic sovereignty.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.880]   He fulfills all things, right?
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.960]   He has universal power.
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.000]   He has absolute authority.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.160]   And the proof of all that is his grand victory of resurrection.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:48.640]   And so when we think about that, we are essentially able to answer the question of, and it's
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:53.640]   this king, we're able to actually paint the picture, so to speak, not necessarily answer
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:29:02.280]   the question, but paint the picture of it's this king who has grand victory, who has universal
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:09.460]   authority, who is giving gifts to the church, who is leading the church in its enablement
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.280]   and its function and also its result.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:16.040]   So we want to wrap up with some meditations then.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.000]   Let's meditate on this.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.560]   If that is the picture that is being painted in verses seven through 10, let me ask you
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.600]   this question and meditate.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:31.240]   If a king is giving us gifts, then will we sit and just envy other people's gifts?
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:35.200]   I think if you guys have heard me preach, you've heard me probably confess this a lot,
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.200]   right?
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.520]   That some days I'm all down, I feel very stressed, I feel kind of incapable.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.120]   I'm like, oh, I forgot to do this thingy.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.600]   And then, oh, I should have done a better job.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.700]   And oh, I should have said this and woulda, shoulda, couldas.
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.200]   Like that is my mind regularly.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.160]   I have this very sensitive guilt radar.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.780]   And then you look over and the guy next to you, he's just like, you know, like getting
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:59.780]   everything done.
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.560]   He's like on top of his task list.
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:06.200]   And when I look to my left, I see this guy who's so disciplined.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.920]   I'm sitting there like, man, I wish I could do that.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:13.280]   I wish I had the skills to get everything done and all that kind of stuff.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:20.300]   I do realize, I mean, if my perspective is limited to just me and my natural tendencies,
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.020]   I'm just going to think that for the rest of my life.
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:27.580]   But thanks be to God, he gives us the scriptures and he says, no, the king has given you gifts
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.120]   according to his great design.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.860]   When the king gives you gifts, you don't sit there and be like, but that guy has more.
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:34.860]   Right?
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:35.860]   Like, what about that guy?
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.380]   You know, like, why would I do that?
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.980]   I would say, thank you so much.
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:44.560]   And you would do according to what you think is going to be really honoring and blessing
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:49.400]   a blessing as a reciprocated thanksgiving to God.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:53.520]   And yes, it's okay to be challenged by the gifts of others, but to sit and wallow like
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.160]   oh, come God, you didn't give me that.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.760]   I'm not sure that's the right perspective.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.760]   Let's meditate on this.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:05.600]   If a victorious, mighty, sovereign, universally sovereign king gives you gifts, why would
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.760]   you sit and worse off act like you didn't get anything?
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.120]   And some of us straight up do that.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.120]   Like, I've got nothing.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.120]   I don't have nothing to offer really.
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.200]   You know, like, nah, you know, I'm just not like all of them.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.560]   I really didn't get stuff.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:25.840]   You know, that guy has both the voice and the technical skills and the charisma.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.760]   I got nothing.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:33.480]   Why would we act like that when the scripture says God has given us the grace?
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.480]   Each one of us, he says.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.240]   God is not like the government.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:45.120]   He didn't accidentally send stimulus checks to dead people and then miss you, right?
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.160]   God has given, he says, each one of us already in Christ.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.080]   And yes, it might not look like the measure you would desire or the measure that we would
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.840]   do it if I was gifting people at the church, but he's done it.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.000]   It would be wrong of us to act like that.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:08.480]   Or if a king gives you a gift, why would you fake like, oh, thank you, and then just stash
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.440]   it in your sock drawer?
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:13.240]   Just hold on to it and say, I know I got it.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.360]   And I kind of, if you notice, I'm kind of making it incrementally worse.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.520]   And you might be surprised to think, is it worse to just be like complaining like, I
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.520]   didn't get anything?
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:25.880]   Or is it worse to fake like you got it, say thank you, and then never use it and shove
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.800]   it away?
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:33.520]   Because of the biblical example of the lazy slave and servant, remember the parable of
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.480]   the talents?
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:43.440]   The owner calls that slave a wicked person who feigns like, OK, I'll take it, but then
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:50.440]   believes in his heart that the person who gave it to him was a wicked man himself, that
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.360]   he was a harsh man.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:33:02.000]   I just want to use this as a moment to quote a famous or popular pastor, Dr. Steve Lawson.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.200]   Truthfully, he's just really intense.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.920]   And when you want to hurt good, you kind of listen to him.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:13.960]   But he says about this passage, and I was listening to a sermon, and then he says, "Not
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:19.440]   to use our gifts is an affront to Christ's wisdom, a rebuff of his love, a dismissal
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:24.440]   of his grace, a loss to his church, and an arrogant self-determination that weakens the
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:27.640]   work of your neighbor and grieves the Spirit of God."
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:31.240]   OK, hope that impersonation was good.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.480]   Oh man, he's right.
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.480]   The effect of sitting there and thinking that I'm going to be passive because I actually
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:47.640]   don't have anything, it is an affront to Christ's wisdom, who is king, who, again, in God's
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:52.280]   wisdom and design has already orchestrated the church as he wills.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:58.120]   So I want to conclude by saying, remember that our church believes every single one
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:03.040]   of you as a person is a gift to this church.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:09.040]   And if you're not motivated, if I sound like a motivational speaker, I want to.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.720]   And I want to motivate you because it's true.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:17.080]   You should be thinking of yourself as a gifted person, expected to use your gifts for this
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.080]   church.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:22.000]   And remember that at this church, that's why we practice membership and it's a part of
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.280]   our membership covenant.
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.440]   Because this is the design of God.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:31.720]   He has made the church beautiful in his own sight, in his own wisdom to make it one, and
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:37.880]   then to gift it and bless it in a variety of ways that it would retain our individuality
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:43.720]   and so that each one of us have this responsibility to lovingly, to carefully use it for the glory
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:44.720]   of God.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.960]   And I hope that you're motivated to do so.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.360]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:52.640]   Our God, we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:35:00.040]   We thank you God for this grace that is particular in that you have gifted each person with their
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.640]   unique lives.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:07.800]   And I pray Father God that that would help us to really just soak in this thought Lord,
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:11.600]   that when we even think about our service in the church, God, first and foremost, we
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:16.320]   do have to think about our relationship to you.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.360]   You gifted us.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.960]   And so now I'm held accountable to you Lord.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:27.280]   Father God, for me to just compare all the time with other people would be to lose sight
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.280]   of you.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:32.520]   Rather, God, I want to make sure and I pray that every single person in the church make
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:38.960]   sure that when they hear this truth, you as King has given us gifts.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.640]   So we thank you Lord.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.880]   Would you empower, continue to empower us?
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.240]   Would you continue to build in us strength?
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:50.280]   Would you continue to build in us perseverance that we would then continue to be about the
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.240]   building of your kingdom and the building of your church.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.800]   We thank you Lord Jesus Christ and we pray.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.800]   Amen.
