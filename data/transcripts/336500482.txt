[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.760]   Okay, all right, so today's Bible study, because it's an overview study, I'm going to just
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.880]   kind of give you an outline and just a brief overview of what we studied and our goal,
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.120]   and then we'll give you plenty of time with your small group, and then obviously we'll
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.160]   have snacks afterwards.
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.000]   So today is the last Bible study, and afterwards we're going to have a little bit over a two-month
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   break.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.640]   Pastor Mark, did you have an announcement for today?
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.800]   Okay, before we get into the small group.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.680]   Okay, let me pray first, and we'll jump in.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:45.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the grace of allowing us to have Bible study with our
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.760]   small groups.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.520]   We pray that the study of Colossians would have caused us to have a deeper understanding
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.000]   of who you are and Christ and what he has done.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.040]   And I pray that our review study will cause the things that we've learned, Lord God, to
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.840]   be embedded much deeper in our conscience and our hearts.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.120]   And we ask, Lord, that you give us openness, and that even in a time of break, Lord God,
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.160]   I pray that your name may be honored and there will be greater fellowship and interaction
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.160]   with your word.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.600]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.200]   Okay, so as I've mentioned at the beginning of the study, that our goal here is not to
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.640]   simply go over Colossians, but to get you to learn to study the Bible on your own, right?
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.440]   So if you've gone through the study of Colossians and you haven't been in the habit of jumping
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.480]   to the word of God yourself, then we've missed the whole point, okay?
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:43.600]   So obviously I prefer you here than not here, but again, our goal was to get you into the
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.240]   Bible yourself so that you can interact with the word of God.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.880]   So you don't just come to the Bible study and say, "Well, tell me what it says," so
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.400]   that you can actually see if what I'm saying is true or not true, right?
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.320]   At some point, you should take something that I said and say, "Huh, I don't know if I see
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.320]   that in the text."
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.320]   Right?
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.760]   If you've been studying carefully, you should at some point, I'm not talking about today,
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.240]   I'm not talking about every week, but know enough about it so that you can look at it
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.480]   and say, "Yeah, you know, I'm not sure how that came about," or at least to be able to
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.960]   ask good questions, okay?
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.200]   So I'm going to go over, again, the review of it.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.360]   Can you put that on the side?
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.440]   Okay.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.840]   So two texts that I'm looking at is 1 Timothy 4:16, where Paul tells Timothy, "Pay close
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.320]   attention to yourself and to your teaching.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.160]   Persevere in these things, for as you do this, you will ensure salvation both for yourself
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.560]   and for those who hear you."
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.000]   Okay, so that's 1 Timothy.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.080]   Second Timothy 2, 14, "Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.520]   does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth."
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.680]   So in both texts, the pastoral texts, the primary theme that Paul is trying to teach
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.360]   Timothy is to make sure that he handles the word of God accurately.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.400]   Second Timothy, he says that, and in conclusion of his letter, he says, "Preach it in season
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.400]   and out of season."
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.600]   Don't stray from the word of God.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.280]   Whether they accept it or don't accept it, whether people come or don't come, whether
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.560]   you feel like it's bearing fruit or don't bear fruit, God has ordained the teaching
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.920]   and hearing of the word of God to bear fruit.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.560]   So again, this is not something unique to Berean community church.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.200]   Every church doesn't have the option to say, "Our church is going to be on missions.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.340]   Our emphasis is going to be about community.
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.960]   Our emphasis is going to be about the lost."
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.080]   No church has the right to pick and choose what the church is going to be about.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.560]   Jesus Christ is the head of the church.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.640]   So who determines what the church is?
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.920]   Who determines what the church needs to emphasize?
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.040]   Christ does.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.600]   So the reason why we emphasize the word of God is because these are the words of Christ.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.720]   So if we do not diligently give ourselves to the word of God, we can easily pick and
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.480]   choose what we want, all right, and emphasize things that we want, de-emphasize things that
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.040]   we don't want, but in the end, we're not following what Christ says.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.520]   So the reason why we have such a high emphasis on God's word from the pulpit and from your
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:24.960]   life is because we can easily be deceived in the church because you are active and spend
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.520]   a lot of time in Christianity that you can easily be deceived to think that I'm following
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.840]   Christ because I happen to be in the Christian circle.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.120]   And so we want to make sure that that's not the case, that individually and collectively
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.280]   we're following Christ.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.160]   And the only way to do that is to hear his voice from his word.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.760]   There's three principles of observation that we talked about in the beginning.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.200]   There's observation, interpretation, and application, right?
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.340]   And all three has to take place.
[00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.240]   If you do not give yourself to study of the Bible, what you end up doing is reading and
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.160]   applying and oftentimes the application is completely off.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.500]   And if you hear of bad doctrines, usually it's because they've read something without
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.040]   understanding it and applied it to church or applied it to their lives, right?
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.840]   So the first thing is observation.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.920]   Observation is asking simple questions, who, what, where, why, when, and how.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.040]   So there's not a lot of digging, right?
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.520]   If you just read it, you know who wrote it.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.080]   If you just read it, right, even if you read three chapters a day, you'll be able to know
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.640]   who wrote it, right?
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.640]   What did they write?
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.640]   Who did they write to?
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.920]   It doesn't require a lot of digging.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.720]   So that's the first part, right?
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.360]   Better than just applying, but observation alone is not good enough because you can also
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.400]   misapply certain things.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.080]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.080]   Okay.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.080]   Hello?
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.280]   Yeah, you guys look like you just got off of 10 hours of work.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.280]   All right.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.280]   So I get it.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.280]   You guys are tired.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.280]   Okay.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.280]   So observation.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.280]   Okay.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.020]   From observation, you have to go to interpretation.
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.240]   What is interpretation?
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.960]   Asking good questions, right?
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.960]   You have to ask questions.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.320]   Well, Paul wrote it, right?
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.320]   Who did he write it to?
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.320]   Why did he write it?
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.320]   Why does he say it this way?
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.160]   Why does this introduction start this way?
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.480]   Why does the ending end this way?
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.520]   What does he mean by this?
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.720]   And asking good questions, which leads to interpretation.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.100]   And only when you have done the observation and interpretation can you jump into application.
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.200]   And application is just as essential.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.880]   If you do the observation, interpretation without application, there's no point in
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.880]   study.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.480]   All it does is puff you up and say, "I know the Bible."
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.280]   It's actually more dangerous to study the Bible without application because it causes
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.480]   us to think that we're closer to God when we're not.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:56.480]   So those are three principles, observation, interpretation, application.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.400]   In the observation, you ask questions, who, what, why, when, or how.
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.120]   Take small chunks at a time.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.720]   How many of you are reading through the Bible?
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.400]   Maybe I shouldn't ask that.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.000]   Raise your hand if you're reading through the Bible a chunk at a time.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.040]   Maybe it's one chapter or three chapters at a time.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.600]   Okay, so a good chunk of you are reading through that.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.680]   So when you're reading that much of the scripture, you're not going to do a lot of interpretation.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.560]   It's important to have a broad view of the Bible.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.320]   Many people don't know the broad view of the Bible, so that's where a lot of bad interpretation
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.840]   comes from.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:38.280]   But having an overview of the study is not enough for you to make accurate application.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:44.360]   So this part of it in observing, you want to make sure that you're taking small chunks,
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.520]   one chapter, two chapter, three chapter, or small chunks at a time.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.000]   The following, you want to ask in observation, what's the background?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.720]   Who are the people involved?
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.160]   What are emphasized words, repeated words?
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.880]   The tense, past, present, or future?
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.760]   What tense is being used?
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.280]   Is it a statement or a command?
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.720]   Is God just saying this is what it is or is he telling us to do something?
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.120]   What genre is it?
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.600]   Is it an epistle?
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.960]   Is it a wisdom literature?
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.640]   Is it poetry?
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:28.320]   Why is it important for us to know which genre it is for interpretation?
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.200]   This is very, very important.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.800]   Okay, poetry is not literal.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:44.760]   What are some dangers you get into if you don't distinguish the genres?
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.760]   Misapplication, yes.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:54.160]   Are the narratives meant to be copied?
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.680]   I had a roommate who wanted to evangelize at Cal State Fullerton when we were in college.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:06.480]   And so in order to conquer Cal State Fullerton, he ran around it seven times.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:12.680]   And then at the end of seven times, he blew a trumpet.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:19.600]   And the spiritual walls, the barriers that keep from evangelism is going to fall down,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.600]   right?
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.120]   Is that a good application?
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.400]   No.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.320]   So the narrative, if you take a narrative and apply it, like I actually read a story
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.680]   of a lady a long time ago who was going up to the prayer mountain and there was a heavy
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.280]   rain that came and it blocked her path to go to the prayer mountain.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.280]   It's like God really wants me to go.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.000]   So she thought, well, Peter walked on the water by faith.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.800]   I'm going to trust in God and walk in the water.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.440]   She ended up drowning.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.200]   So this is a story that I read when I was younger.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.760]   So I mean, bad, bad application, right?
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:02.600]   So if you apply certain things to a narrative, which was never meant to be copied, that's
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.000]   where, again, bad application comes from.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.960]   Somebody will read a certain text about David and Goliath and how he sharpened his skills
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.440]   to defeat Goliath and how we need to sharpen our skills.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:21.200]   And is the point of the story that David practiced throwing stones and that's why he was able
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.080]   to conquer the Goliath?
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.240]   So therefore, we need to really be faithful in practicing our skill?
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.280]   Is that the point of the story?
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.280]   No.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:36.320]   A mighty God can use a scrawny man to kill a huge giant, right?
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.560]   The story is about God and his power, right?
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:45.440]   But a lot of bad interpretation comes from when you misapply your interpretation to the
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.160]   wrong genre, okay?
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.960]   Here's another thing that people get into trouble a lot.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.760]   Is it descriptive or prescriptive?
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.280]   What's the difference between that?
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:01.720]   Descriptive, again, it's just another way of saying it's just telling us it happened,
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.720]   right?
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.480]   Prescriptive is a command.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:10.280]   And there's a lot of people get into problems like, let's say, being filled with the Holy
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.680]   Spirit, right?
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.880]   They'll take Acts chapter 2, they prayed heavily to God and the Holy Spirit came and anointing
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.360]   they spoke in tongues.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.780]   So therefore, when we pray, we need to receive tongues.
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.040]   Is that a good application?
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.480]   No.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.440]   Is that descriptive or prescriptive?
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.300]   Descriptive, because it's just telling us what happened.
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.600]   It's not commanding us that this is normal.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.400]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:47.360]   So in interpretation, if you do not know the genre, or you don't understand, or you misapply
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.880]   it, then that's where very, very bad interpretation comes from, right?
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.480]   So that's one of the big things I find all the time.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.480]   Is it descriptive?
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.480]   Is it prescriptive?
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.680]   And a lot of times people will say certain things and say, "Well, I have the Bible,"
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:07.080]   and they'll open up a narrative part of the Bible and say, "This is where I got it," right?
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.240]   The narratives are descriptive, not prescriptive, okay?
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.440]   Purpose, words such as "for," "so," "then," right?
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.320]   Those are words that we need to highlight because it's connecting thoughts, right?
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.080]   And these are all part of observation.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.680]   Interpretation.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.280]   What is the historical context?
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.880]   What is the cultural context, right?
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.880]   What is the context of rest of Scripture?
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.660]   What is the context of the immediate letter?
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.800]   So I say over and over again, what is one of the most important things that you need
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.000]   to learn in interpreting?
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.840]   Context, context, context, right?
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.640]   What does "bomb" mean?
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:53.120]   In one context, it means something completely different in another context, right?
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.120]   Like I can't think of anything.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.120]   Huh?
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.120]   Food?
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.120]   Okay, the bomb, okay?
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.640]   Right, so it could mean good.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.240]   It can be something explosive.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.240]   You know what I'm talking about.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.320]   My mind is going blank.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.340]   There's a bunch of these things, right?
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.440]   So you have to understand the historical context.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.560]   Don't read the Scripture and assume that's what it means.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.760]   You have to ask, "What does that mean?"
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.500]   Even simple things, right?
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.400]   So even the heart.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.360]   We read, "God says something about the heart."
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.120]   I mentioned this so many times, you should know, that the heart in the Bible doesn't
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.400]   necessarily refer to emotion like the way we do, right?
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.320]   The way that the word "heart" is used in the New Testament context is talking about
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.800]   your soul, your whole being.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.500]   So similar to your soul, right?
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:49.040]   So if you don't understand the historical context, then you're going to read that and
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.840]   just apply it, "Oh, don't trust your emotions."
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.160]   Do not lean on your own understanding, don't trust your heart.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.960]   It's, "Oh, don't trust your emotions."
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.760]   No, basically it's saying don't trust yourself.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.720]   It's not just saying don't trust your emotions.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.280]   Don't trust your intellect either.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:12.240]   Our Western culture has a tendency to think, "Don't trust emotion," but our intellect is
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.300]   sanctified.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:18.320]   So if we can logically explain what the Bible says, then we're safe.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:26.000]   No, our ability to reason is just as tainted as our ability to feel, right?
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.280]   So that's why the Scripture says, basically saying, "Don't trust your own judgment," to
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.280]   rely on God's Word and the Holy Spirit.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:38.760]   Anyway, so you have to, the context, context, context.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.200]   And then keys to good application.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.980]   When you apply the Word of God and you say, "I want to be a better Christian," right?
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:50.120]   Did you not have that application before you read the Bible?
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.060]   Was that not an application before you studied?
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.060]   Of course it was.
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:15:00.600]   So if all you did at the end of it was, "Oh, I should do a better job," you know, it's
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.840]   not bad, right?
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.540]   That's good.
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:09.920]   But if your application is not specific, if it is not personal, it is not practical, it
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.960]   is not possible, most likely you're not going to apply it, right?
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:20.160]   If you leave this room thinking like, "Oh man, I should pray more," right?
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.040]   You're probably not going to pray.
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.180]   Some of you will.
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:27.720]   A lot of you will just leave feeling just guilty.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.640]   And then you didn't actually apply it.
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.480]   So a good application, right, is there an example to follow?
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.200]   Is there a sin to avoid?
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.420]   Is there a promise to claim?
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.680]   Is there a prayer to repeat?
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.560]   Is there a command to obey?
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.200]   And is there a verse to memorize?
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.600]   And what I apply, is it personal, is it practical, right?
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.760]   If you're going to pray, when are you going to pray?
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.620]   What are you going to pray for?
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.880]   What is it that has inspired you to pray, right?
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.880]   And to make an application so that you can measure that after and say, "This is what
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.680]   I'm applying," right?
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:06.440]   So application has to be personal, possible, and practical.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.920]   Or else you just end up leaving with impressions in your heart that doesn't make any application,
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.920]   right?
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:19.080]   So if you want to be holy, right, which every Christian ought to be pursuing holiness, what
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:23.080]   does pursuit of holiness look like in your life?
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:28.440]   Instead of just saying, "Man, I should be more holy," right, what does that mean?
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:33.400]   Does that mean it should affect the things that you watch?
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.360]   If you say no, why not?
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:43.580]   Does that affect the way, the things that you think, what you listen to, right?
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:49.640]   So if you don't apply it in a very practical way, you end up thinking you're pursuing holiness,
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.060]   but in reality, really, there is no application of it, right?
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:17:00.400]   So again, application has to be very specific, personal, possible, and practical, okay?
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:08.040]   Alright, so the rest of the time, I wanted to go over just the text itself in Colossians
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.760]   and just a large overview, right?
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:15.640]   Remember, we said that the Book of Colossians four chapters divided into two major parts,
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.480]   and what are these two major parts?
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.480]   Huh?
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:30.600]   Okay, so chapter one and two is primarily indicative, right?
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:37.280]   It's about the gospel, it's about the identity of Christ, and then chapter three and four,
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.280]   they are imperatives.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:44.240]   They are for, right, they are for you ought to apply what you've been taught in chapter
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.160]   one and two, you ought to apply in chapter three and four, right?
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:54.960]   And chapter three and four primarily is put off your old self, put on the new self, right?
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.720]   And then it gets to chapter four where Paul begins to say goodbye, and we see all the
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.100]   different names, right?
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.120]   So that's how the Bible, that's how Colossians is divided.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:11.240]   In fact, next time you study a different epistle, I want you to see if you can see that same
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.420]   pattern.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:17.120]   I don't think you'll see it in every letter, but you'll see it in a lot of letters, the
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:22.160]   same pattern, indicative imperative, indicative imperative, okay?
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:29.320]   And so once you get that, once you get the broad outline, it's easier to remember, okay?
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.360]   Because you got two chapters, introduction, right?
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:39.320]   Paul's ministry, identity of Jesus, therefore live up to what you know, right?
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.460]   Put off the old self, put on the new self, and then goodbye, right?
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.460]   With all these people.
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.800]   That's the broad outline of the book of Colossians, okay?
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.760]   So I want to get into a little bit more detail, and then I'm going to give you the rest of
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:51.920]   the time to study.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.760]   So verse one and two, okay?
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:19:00.200]   In the indicative side, basically he opens up with hello, okay?
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:05.520]   And I'm not going to go into all the interpretation of these passages, but what we do know is
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.720]   that he's writing a letter to the Colossians, to faithful ones, right?
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.040]   He's not writing this letter to rebuke people necessarily, he's writing the letter to protect
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.000]   them, that the faithful people will persevere in their faith.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.720]   That's verses one and two.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:26.120]   And then verses three to seven, in his introduction, he reviews why he's writing this letter to
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.760]   them, right?
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.900]   And in this text, if you remember, there are three things that stood out.
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:36.320]   He says there, "Since we heard of your faith in Christ, love which you have for one another,
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.480]   which is based on hope laid out for you in heaven," which summarizes the effects of the
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.040]   gospel in the book of Colossians, to the Colossian church, right?
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.600]   These three virtues.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:52.960]   Every Christian ought to have love, faith, and hope, right?
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:58.360]   Faith, which is the reason why we have love, right?
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.760]   And hope is the reason why we persevere, right?
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.280]   And every Christian has that in growing capacity.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.120]   Out of these three, which is the greatest?
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.600]   You learned in Sunday school, right?
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.600]   Love is the greatest.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.960]   So watch.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:20.600]   In the indicatives, right, you'll see a lot of faith and hope.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:26.640]   In the imperatives, you will see a lot of love, okay?
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.680]   You'll see that in Colossians.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.560]   You'll see that in Ephesians.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.200]   You'll see that in Romans, right?
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:39.920]   So faith, based on hope, produces what?
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.920]   Love.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.920]   Okay, remember that, right?
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:47.400]   Because when you study the New Testament, you're going to find a pattern, right?
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.000]   Indicatives are filled with faith.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.540]   Things have pertained to faith and hope.
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:57.560]   And then it says, "Therefore," this is how you ought to live, practice of love, okay?
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:05.120]   So verses 3 to 8 is the beginning of what the gospel is accomplishing in Colossians,
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.680]   right, in his introduction.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:15.240]   Verses 9 through 24, where Paul says, verse 9 through 11, "To have knowledge.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.160]   For this reason also, since the day we heard, we have not ceased to pray for you and to
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:24.080]   ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will and his spiritual wisdom and understanding."
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.120]   And so he repeats this idea of knowledge, right?
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:32.800]   "I'm praying for you so that you may continue to grow, continue to practice what you profess
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.680]   to believe," and he says that your knowledge, your wisdom and understanding will continue
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.000]   to grow, okay?
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   So 9 through 11 is a projection of Paul praying for them to have this knowledge.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.040]   Well, what knowledge does he want them to have, right?
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.640]   Verses 12 through 24, the knowledge of his son, Jesus Christ.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.560]   Do you get the flow?
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.560]   Right?
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.720]   So he starts with the introduction, and then he says, "The effects of the gospel, love,
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.480]   faith and hope to the Colossian church," says, "I'm praying for you so that you may have
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:10.280]   knowledge and wisdom, that you may live the way that God called you to live," and then
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:15.140]   he actually gets into this knowledge, and which knowledge is he referring to?
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.620]   Knowledge of his son, Jesus Christ.
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.520]   So look how often he mentions Jesus here.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:24.720]   He doesn't use the word Jesus, but I've highlighted, right?
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:32.320]   He, whom, he, by him, through him, for him, he, him, he, himself, him, himself, him, him,
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.520]   him, he, he, he, him, over and over, right?
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.640]   All through verse 24.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.640]   You understand?
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.200]   You see the flow, right?
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:46.720]   It's almost like Apostle Paul learned how to write a term paper in college, right?
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.800]   And he's like, "You have the thesis, and then you have the sub-point, and then you have
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.280]   to make your point," and that's exactly how he writes.
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:58.240]   Paul's letters are very organized, right?
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.400]   And so he says, "Hello, how are you?
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.160]   You know, I heard about your faith, love, faith, and hope.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:09.240]   I'm praying for you so that you will continue to know and have wisdom to live continuously,
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.000]   and this is what you need to know about Jesus," right?
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.120]   And that takes us all the way through verse 24.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:25.280]   And then Paul, after he introduces Jesus, he introduces basically himself, right?
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:32.200]   This is what God called me to do, because why does he introduce himself to the Colossians?
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.340]   He's never been there, right?
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:38.280]   He's only heard about them through Epaphras and through different people.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.640]   So partially, he's introducing himself.
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.360]   He's introducing Christ, and he's introducing his ministry, right?
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:52.920]   Why does Paul need to introduce himself to this group?
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.880]   This letter is not just a personal letter.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.760]   This is Scripture that he's writing, right?
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.240]   He's sending it to them so that they can read it, and then they would have authority over
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:06.200]   their lives, and then they're supposed to take that and then share it with other churches.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:11.000]   So this is not just an average person writing a letter and saying, "Hey, you guys don't
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.240]   know me, but here I am," right?
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:17.400]   He's introducing what God is doing through him, right, in spreading the gospel and writing
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.720]   Scripture, right?
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:25.480]   So in verses 25 to chapter 2, verse 5, over and over, and you said, "I was made a minister,"
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.480]   right?
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:31.560]   "And God bestowed upon me the benefit that I might fully carry out the preaching," right?
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.640]   "We proclaim Him.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.080]   We may present to every man completely.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:38.200]   I labor, striving, mightily working within me," over and over again, right?
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.840]   He's talking about himself and the ministry.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.800]   "I want to know how much I struggle," right?
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.400]   "I am absent in the body, but I am with you in spirit," right?
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:53.880]   So that's Paul introducing his ministry and God's authority through what he's doing, right?
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:57.120]   So all of this is directly connected to the gospel, right?
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.120]   "Hello, how are you?"
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.800]   The gospel is bearing fruit, love, faith, and hope.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:06.240]   Like the God, "I need you to know more and more of the gospel," and the Jesus of the
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.960]   gospel, right?
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.620]   And how God called me to the gospel, right?
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:15.760]   So the central theme is what God is doing through the gospel and the main person of
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:21.480]   the gospel, Jesus Christ, and how Paul is playing a role in spreading of that gospel,
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.160]   okay?
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:30.640]   In chapter 2, 6, verse 3 to 4, you can look at all the different words that are used here,
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.880]   and the theme here is union with Christ, right?
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.880]   Union with Christ.
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:43.140]   What did Jesus accomplish through the preaching of Apostle Paul?
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.700]   I'm going to get into this in my next sermon, not this Sunday, but next Sunday.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:54.340]   But union with Christ is the primary product of the gospel, right?
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.860]   Let me say that again.
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:01.180]   Union with Christ is the primary fruit of the gospel, and that's what Paul leads us
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.180]   to.
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.660]   So over and over again, he says, "To walk with him, you are built up with him, for in
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:11.140]   him all the fullness, in him, in him, with him, with him, with him," right?
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:17.920]   Through him, with Christ, over and over again, this union with Christ, okay?
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:22.020]   So I'm going to keep reviewing so that you can have it in your head.
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:28.500]   Introduction, fruit of the gospel, et kalase, and what fruits are there?
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.840]   Love, faith, and hope.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.480]   Paul prays that they would have knowledge, and which knowledge is he referring to?
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.100]   Jesus Christ.
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.920]   And where does Paul fit into this after?
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.200]   Paul was called to preach this Jesus that he just preached to you, right?
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.300]   And then as a result of that, what happens?
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:51.760]   Union with Christ, with Christ, walk with Christ, built up in Christ, right?
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.640]   That's what the gospel accomplished.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:27:00.360]   Because he died for us, covered our sins, now we are united with Christ, right?
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:05.680]   Okay.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.320]   And then chapter three is where we get into the imperatives.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.880]   "Therefore, since you are united with Christ," right?
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:17.720]   And then chapter three is, "Put off your old self."
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.720]   It doesn't belong with Christ anymore, right?
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:25.800]   Your old life may have been perfectly fine when you were just in the flesh, you were
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.880]   worldly.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:33.120]   But now that you are united with Christ, right, what you cannot bring to Christ, you can't
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.080]   bring to the temple, you can't have in your life, right?
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.200]   And that's basically what he's saying.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.640]   To put off your old self, to put on the new self.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.560]   So put off the old self.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:47.400]   He says anger, wrath, malice, slander, abusive speech from your mouth, to put all the stuff
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.680]   that's from the past off, and then to put on, put on the new self, right?
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.840]   And what is the new self that he wants us to put on?
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:03.400]   Heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience, put on love, right?
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.600]   So remember what I said?
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.520]   When you're in the indicatives, like faith, right?
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:15.400]   Knowledge of Jesus, faith, hope that we have because of what he has accomplished.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.600]   And because we have faith and hope, we have imperative.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.160]   What's the imperative primarily?
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.120]   Love, to put on love, okay?
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.000]   That's chapter three.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.560]   You follow?
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.920]   Okay, I'm going to test you afterwards, how many of you are paying attention.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:36.960]   So I want you to, after, and say Colossians, that you say, "Okay, there's two big outlines,
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.480]   chapter one and two, three and four, indicative, right?
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.680]   Theology, and then practice, application."
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.480]   In the indicative, right?
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.520]   Introduction, right?
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:53.480]   Fruit, knowledge of Jesus, Paul's ministry, right?
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.040]   And then union with Christ.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:00.160]   In the imperatives, because of this union with Christ, put your mind on the things above,
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.760]   put off your old self, put on the new self, right?
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.600]   Which is love, okay?
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.920]   And then he goes into specifics of what does it mean to put on love in the context of being
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:16.040]   a wife, a husband, child, father, slave, and masters, okay?
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:23.720]   That's the imperatives in chapter three, or all the way to chapter four, verse six, okay?
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:24.720]   Are you getting it?
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.720]   Okay, some of you guys are getting it with your eyes closed.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.360]   All right.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:37.140]   And then the final greetings, chapter four, seven through 18, okay?
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.720]   And it divides into two parts.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:43.760]   The first part, he's saying hello from his companions, right?
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.720]   These are the people who are with him, and then he says, "These people," sends greeting,
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.840]   and then at the tail end of it, he says, "Say hello to these people who are over there."
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.800]   That's how he ends the letter, okay?
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.000]   All right, let's see if we can do this without looking.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.160]   Okay, I told you I was going to test you.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.760]   Let's see if we can do this without testing.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.760]   Too large, right?
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:11.160]   Chapter one and two, three and four, indicative, imperative.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.160]   Let's look at the indicatives.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:18.120]   In the indicative, he starts with, "Hello."
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.660]   Fruit.
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.800]   And what's in the fruit of the gospel?
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.720]   Okay, love, faith, and hope, right?
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.520]   And then he says, "I'm praying for you to have knowledge," and then what does he teach
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.000]   about that?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   About Christ, primarily.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.560]   He, him, he, him, through whom, him, him, him, him, he, he, he, right?
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:43.000]   Everything about Jesus and what he has accomplished and who he is, right?
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Christology.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.440]   And then right after he says that, what does he say?
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.000]   He introduces himself, right?
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.080]   I, I, I, we, we, we, I, I, labor, I labor.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.360]   I've been called, right?
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:03.080]   And then as a result of that, what happened?
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:07.560]   Union with Christ, built up with him, walk with him, right?
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.160]   So that's the imperative.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.600]   And as a result of our union with Christ, he says in the imperative, chapter three and
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.640]   four, "Put off," right?
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.640]   That's the larger, right?
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:24.000]   He says, "Since you have been united with Christ, set your mind to the things that are
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.340]   above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God," right?
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:28.340]   And he begins with that.
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:32.600]   Since you are united, put off your old self and put on your new self.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.680]   And what's the new self that you're supposed to put on?
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.280]   Love, primarily, okay?
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:42.720]   It doesn't just say love, but you can summarize it basically by love, right?
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:48.760]   And then we go to chapter four, basically say, "Bye, my friends here says hello, say
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.520]   hello to your friends over there," okay?
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.260]   The end.
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:54.260]   You got it?
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:55.260]   Okay.
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:56.760]   So just keep that in mind.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.800]   Keep that in mind, those two things that I said, right?
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.520]   Most of the letters are divided in that way, indicative and imperative, right?
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:08.200]   And in the indicative, there's an emphasis on what?
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.200]   Faith and hope.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.540]   In the imperative, the emphasis is on love, okay?
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:19.800]   So if you forget everything tonight, at least remember that, okay?
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.880]   So to help you when you study the other texts, okay?
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:31.200]   So today's discussion is the discussion of what you guys were supposed to prepare for
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.200]   today.
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.800]   Like, what new insights did you gain about God?
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.640]   What new insight did you gain about Jesus and the gospel?
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.120]   What new insight did you gain about yourself?
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.240]   What new application did you make through the study of this letter?
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.400]   And how faithful were you to the weekly exegesis?
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:50.400]   So a couple of things that aren't in here is the key verse, right?
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.380]   What is a key verse that you think captures?
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.600]   So hopefully you guys can take some time to share that.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:58.700]   And then if you were to rename, not Colossians, right?
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:02.800]   If somebody says, "Give me one sentence description of Colossians," okay?
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:07.400]   Which is in the previous instruction, but I don't have it here, okay?
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.760]   So I'll give you guys some time to discuss that, but let me pray for us, okay?
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.640]   And then Pastor Mark has an announcement.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:19.680]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:24.320]   And I thank you for my brothers and sisters that even after a long day of working and
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:30.240]   various things that we're here each week, Lord God, just diving into your word.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:35.600]   I pray that your word would truly come alive, that it would affect our intellect, our heart,
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.800]   our will in every way, Father, that our hungering for you would translate into hungering for
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.800]   your word.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.720]   I pray for your blessing over the time of discussion.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.320]   May it be fruitful unto you.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.320]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:46.320]   Amen.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.200]   Amen.
