[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the blessing that we have in you, and we thank you for
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.380]   the opportunity for us to come and study your word.
[00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.920]   We pray, Father God, that with all the treasures that you have placed in your word would cause
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.720]   us to give our hearts and our mind to you.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.480]   We ask that you would bless us in our study, bless us in our fellowship, and all that we
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.920]   do, help us, Lord God, to have a heart that is more ready to be molded and to draw closer
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.920]   to you.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.240]   So we pray for your grace and your blessing over this time.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.240]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.240]   Amen.
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.240]   All right, I should have gotten your papers.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.240]   Everybody got it?
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.240]   Okay.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:57.880]   All right, so if you, just as a broad overview, if you look at chapter 54 and 55, it is after
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.640]   chapter 53, right, the chapter 53 important passage about the suffering of Christ and
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.960]   how he's going to redeem his people, and then again, these are all passages that are interconnected.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.280]   If you look at chapter 54, there's a logical conclusion of what he says in 53, that as
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.960]   a result of what Christ has done in chapter 53, that he's going to establish an everlasting
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.800]   covenant and how this covenant is going to bring upon his mercy and compassion, restore
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.800]   his people.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.480]   And then in chapter 55, the ultimate end result, ultimate gift of his sacrifice is to say,
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.680]   you guys can come, come everyone who thirsts and come to the water.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.960]   So ultimately, the goal of salvation is really chapter 55, right?
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.800]   The goal of chapter 55 isn't simply so that your sins are forgiven, but because your sins
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.160]   are forgiven, that you can now come and drink of the living water of Christ, that you can
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.560]   come and listen and you can be restored and have peace.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.560]   So ultimately, if our understanding of salvation is our sins are forgiven, then you really
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.000]   missed the whole point of salvation.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.060]   The whole point of salvation is to restore a broken relationship with Christ, right?
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.240]   So all of these things that he's been saying, it ultimately leads us to chapter 55.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.920]   So if you look at chapter 54, the first question that was asked, I forgot to break it up.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.920]   So you're just going to have to just jot it all down at once and then I'll get to it once
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.600]   you fill in the blanks.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.600]   Okay.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.880]   I'll give you a minute to fill in all the blanks so you guys can pay attention the rest
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.880]   of the time.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.700]   (ice cr youring)
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.280]   (ice cringing)
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.860]   (ice cringing)
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.440]   (ice cringing)
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.020]   (ice cringing)
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.600]   (ice cringing)
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.180]   (ice cringing)
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.760]   (ice cringing)
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.340]   (ice cringing)
[00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.920]   (ice cringing)
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.500]   (ice cringing)
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.080]   (ice cringing)
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.660]   (ice cringing)
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.240]   (ice cringing)
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.820]   (ice cringing)
[00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.400]   (ice cringing)
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.980]   (ice cringing)
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.560]   (ice cringing)
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.340]   All done?
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:23.460]   Okay, so if you look at the first section
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.260]   in verses one through three, or maybe even up to four,
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.220]   the primary theme of this section
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.460]   is God's promise of restoration, right?
[00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.100]   God's promise of restoration.
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.260]   So the first question was, who's the barren one?
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.740]   It's talking about the spiritual state of Israel.
[00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.460]   Why does God call spiritual condition of Israel barren?
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.040]   (ice cringing)
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.540]   It's typically, again, it's all out here,
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.540]   so I'm not gonna have awkward pauses,
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.740]   so you already know, all right?
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.380]   So the reason why I call it barren
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.860]   is because in the Old Testament,
[00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.540]   to be barren or not to be able to have children
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.540]   was often interpreted as God's judgment upon them.
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.440]   So when he says, "Oh, barren one,"
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.060]   he's talking about the spiritual condition of Israel
[00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.420]   because of their sins that God's spirit,
[00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.220]   again, was taken away.
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.380]   They were taken into captivity,
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.900]   and it was understood as people
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.820]   who have been forsaken of God.
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.140]   But this section, basically, God comes in and said,
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.020]   "Even though that's been your condition,
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.460]   "God's going to reverse this fortune,
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.420]   "and Israel will be greater than the judgment
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.860]   "they experienced in their exile."
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.020]   So if you look at the text when he says,
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.040]   "For the children," sorry,
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.300]   "For the children of the desolate one will be more
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.360]   "than the children of her who is married," says the Lord.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.720]   "Enlarge the place of your tent
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.820]   "and let the curtains of your habitation be stretched out.
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.900]   "Do not hold back.
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.740]   "Lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes,
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.940]   "for you will spread abroad to the right and to the left,
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.860]   "and your offspring will possess the nations
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.500]   "and will people the desolate cities."
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.500]   So he goes on and on.
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.220]   So when he says that the children of the barren women
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.740]   are gonna be much more than those who weren't,
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.140]   who weren't barren, what is he referring to?
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.460]   What does it sound a lot like in Romans?
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.020]   Those of you who paid attention to the sermon this Sunday,
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.560]   in Romans.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:25.840]   What were we talking about on Sunday, in Romans?
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.840]   Chapter five, verse 15.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.080]   Much more, right?
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.400]   Over and over again, Paul says, "Much more."
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.660]   His grace is gonna be much more than the judgment.
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.660]   His justification is much more than the condemnation.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.360]   His life is gonna be much more than the death.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.060]   So basically, this is the Old Testament version of that.
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.260]   Those of you who are barren, at one point you were judged,
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.140]   but when God chooses to restore,
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.780]   the restoration is going to be so much more
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.660]   than even before you went into judgment.
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.740]   So God's promise of redemption
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.820]   is not simply to place you back to where you were.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.180]   It's gonna be beyond that.
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.700]   So this is kind of a side question,
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.660]   but people ask the question, if Adam and Eve,
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.060]   I think we dealt with this once before,
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.640]   but if Adam and Eve fell at the Garden of Eden,
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.180]   what guarantees that after we're redeemed,
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.280]   we go to heaven, that we won't fall again?
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.180]   Are we able to fall in heaven,
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.080]   or are we just given a second chance,
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.060]   and we're gonna go to heaven,
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.700]   and hopefully we don't blow it this time?
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.500]   Or is this whole thing gonna be cycled over and over again
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.340]   in eternity?
[00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.460]   - No, because we'll be different
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.500]   without the Holy Spirit, without the abergine bodies
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.100]   that are better than the unfallen bodies.
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.380]   - Right.
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.940]   So the restoration, the redemption
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.580]   that you and I are gonna experience is far greater
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.500]   than what Adam and Eve experienced at the Garden of Eden.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.380]   We have the Holy Spirit indwelling in us, right?
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.860]   Where in the Old Testament, the Holy Spirit
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.860]   may have been upon people, now,
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.700]   because of his blood sacrifice,
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.740]   the Holy Spirit is actually in us, right?
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.100]   So if we're able to sin in eternity,
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.060]   that means Jesus is able to sin too, right?
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.500]   Because now Jesus Christ and his Spirit,
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.060]   the Holy Spirit is a mediator for us for eternity,
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.860]   not just for a period, but for eternity,
[00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.660]   so that when it says his sacrifice is complete,
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.740]   it is complete for eternity,
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.900]   not until we get to heaven, and we're gonna start over.
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.620]   So when he says, when he chooses to restore his people,
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.060]   and it's going to be much greater, right?
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.740]   He's not just restoring us to back to where we were lost.
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.020]   What other story in the Old Testament
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.660]   reminds you of what he says here?
[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.260]   There's a particular story, the way it ends,
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.820]   kind of illustrates this point.
[00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.620]   Book of Job, right?
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.740]   He loses all of these things,
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.460]   but at the end of the story, right,
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.420]   he gets back and, you know, far greater than what he lost.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.500]   And the point of that is, when God restores,
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.700]   he restores beyond your imagination, right?
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.500]   So again, he begins chapter 54,
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.100]   because of what Christ has done in 53,
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.520]   that his blessing is going to be far greater.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.980]   How does the Lord describe the previous sins of Israel?
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.700]   He calls them, basically, teenagers.
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.300]   Fear not, for you will not be ashamed,
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.780]   be not confounded, for you will not be disgraced,
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.440]   for you will forget the shame of your youth,
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.140]   and the reproach of your widowhood,
[00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.780]   you will remember no more.
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.500]   So when you think about immature youth,
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.820]   or teenage, you know, or adolescent stage,
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.660]   or kind of like the way it's described here,
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.820]   talking about the sins of Israel,
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.620]   and the baggage that comes with your sin,
[00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.980]   right, will be erased.
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.060]   And there's a big difference.
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.220]   Again, like when, again, not to say
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.660]   that the sins of the youth isn't as serious,
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.060]   but the way God describes it is,
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.040]   kind of like seeing the sin of Israel,
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.040]   that their immaturity has led to this,
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.740]   and God's not gonna hold it against them forever.
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.200]   I think anybody who's raised children,
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.260]   you know, there are things like that they may do,
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.880]   if a stranger did it, I mean, it would be over.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.440]   They said and did, and after everything you poured out
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.060]   to them, and they don't appreciate you,
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.940]   and they say, I mean, it would've been over.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.060]   The only reason why you and I all live
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.100]   is because during that stage, our parents were gracious.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.360]   They forgave us, right?
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.720]   Because we were their children.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.440]   And there's not a single person here
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.620]   that hasn't acted selfishly, foolishly,
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.500]   said hurtful things, you know,
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.860]   didn't appreciate our parents,
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.680]   but because they were gracious to us during that period,
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.060]   we're able to mature out of that.
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.620]   And that's how God describes Israel's past sin,
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.140]   that they are immature in their youth,
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.600]   and the baggage that they had,
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.000]   God is not going to hold it against them, right?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.960]   How does he describe, how is he going to restore them
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.560]   beyond the way it was before?
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.580]   He describes them as people who've been widowed
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.660]   without husband, but when God restores,
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.420]   he doesn't just restore them back to where they were,
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.120]   he says, no, God himself is going to be their husband.
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:19.500]   So maybe the Babylonians, that you married with them,
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.060]   and they abandoned you.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.200]   Maybe you relied on money or idols, and they abandoned you.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.340]   Maybe on your own wealth or own ability,
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.380]   maybe they abandoned you,
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.900]   but because God is going to be your husband,
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.400]   he will remain faithful, right?
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.160]   So when he restores, he's going to come in,
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.740]   and he himself is going to be the husband.
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:48.920]   What promise does he say, as an example?
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.500]   So all of this is connected to, I'm going to restore you,
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.020]   my grace is going to be much more than the sin,
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.500]   my redemption is going to be much more
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.540]   than the condemnation.
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:59.700]   Well, how is he going to do that?
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.760]   Well, when I restore you, I myself will be your husband.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.100]   And as an example, he says,
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.600]   my covenant will remain forever,
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.900]   just like the covenant that I made with Noah.
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.740]   When the flood came and all those people died,
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.100]   and at the end of that, God gives them rainbow,
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.260]   and says, every time you look at that,
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.960]   remember what I said to you,
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.380]   that I will never wipe out the earth with a flood again.
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.460]   So he reminds them of the covenant,
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.560]   that this covenant that I make with you
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.100]   is an everlasting covenant.
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.740]   So in verse 10, it says,
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.500]   for the mountains may depart and the hills be removed,
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.500]   but my steadfast love shall not depart from you,
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.900]   and my covenant of peace shall not be removed,
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.780]   says the Lord, who has compassion on you.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.900]   I don't know if you were able to go through it,
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.300]   how many times he mentions the word compassion.
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.380]   He repeats over and over again,
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.440]   especially in this section, compassion.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.040]   Compassion basically means deep-seated emotion,
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.640]   that God is moving emotionally,
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.960]   because he sees the plight of Israel,
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.320]   and he decides to have compassion.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.420]   And that's the, again, in the larger scale,
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.120]   he sees the sins of mankind, he has compassion.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:14.360]   And he looks at the judgment that he brought upon mankind
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.020]   through the flood, and he has compassion,
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.060]   and he says, I will never do this again.
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.000]   But everything that God has promised,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.840]   that he's going to do in 53,
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.800]   and what he is saying in 54, the restoration and redemption.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.380]   You can bank on it, even if the mountains move.
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:34.200]   Have you ever seen a mountain move?
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.200]   Yeah, maybe, if you have a rural area,
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.760]   and then you cut it down and put buildings in.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.320]   I think when I visited Korea last,
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.360]   I forget, in April or something, and I went over there,
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.120]   and I went to go, I had a free day,
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.400]   and I went to go visit my hometown.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.680]   And obviously, there's a lot of things
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.280]   that were new, different, but the hill that I remember
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.600]   when I was a kid that was in front of our house,
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.600]   is exactly the same.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.480]   There's more houses, and the houses are modern,
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.600]   but the hill is exactly the same.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.160]   So they're using that illustration,
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.040]   that even though all of these things may change,
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.000]   God's covenant will never change.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.300]   So in other words, you can put your confidence
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.360]   in his promises, and that's what he's leading to,
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.600]   in verse 11, "O afflicted one, storm-tossed
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.760]   and not comforted, behold, I will set your stones
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.760]   in antimony, and lay your foundations with sapphires."
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:37.040]   God will establish a new city that will be much more
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.200]   precious than the previous city.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.440]   He's talking about the gate and the wall
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.120]   is going to be restored.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.840]   The gates and walls typically talk about
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.520]   the boundaries for protection,
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.180]   but it's also a display of the magnificent.
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.440]   So again, in ancient times, when they talk about
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.320]   how the gates are gonna be fortified,
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.720]   and the walls are going to be tall,
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.840]   and it's gonna be strong, basically it's saying
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.520]   that God's going to come and protect Israel.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.420]   He's going to be the gate, he's going to be the boundaries.
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.240]   That the enemies who attacked them and took them
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.560]   into captivity will never be able to do that again
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.200]   because God himself is gonna establish these gates.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.740]   But the gates also signify the wealth of the city.
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.140]   So it talks about all these different stones
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:20.980]   that it's gonna be made of.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.380]   And I asked you to turn to Revelations 21
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.260]   and compare these two descriptions,
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.780]   'cause in Revelations 21, after all the drama
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.460]   of the tribulation and the millennium,
[00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.340]   and when the kingdom finally comes,
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.180]   he describes this exact same city,
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.620]   made of precious stones.
[00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:43.940]   So if you've ever Googled heaven, you'll see a lot of times
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.340]   the picture of heaven will be roads laid with
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.580]   rubies and sapphire and whatever precious stones there are.
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.780]   Right?
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.700]   'Cause it's, God is describing through illustrating
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.660]   of these stones that heaven, the city of God,
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:14:59.940]   is going to be a precious.
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.620]   It's not only gonna be strong, it's gonna be precious.
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:12.300]   And what does he say, again, even beyond that,
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.540]   about the residents?
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:16.860]   That their blessing will go beyond just themselves,
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.500]   but overflow to their children.
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:24.780]   He says, verse 13, "All your children shall be taught
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.500]   "by the Lord, and great shall be the peace
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.140]   "of your children.
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.100]   "In righteousness, you shall be established.
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.500]   "You shall be far from oppression, for you shall not fear,
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.340]   "and from terror, for it shall not come near to you."
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.540]   So in verse 13, it describes how God's blessing
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.940]   is not simply gonna be for them,
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.740]   but even overflow to their children.
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.580]   Right?
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.900]   And so all of this is a description of the reverse
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.900]   of the curse that mankind experiences
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.180]   in Genesis chapter three.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:58.780]   So one of the biggest curses, right,
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.300]   of the fallen world, oftentimes,
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:03.580]   is between husband and wife, right?
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.020]   I mean, you can get in a fight with your coworkers,
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.380]   you can get in a fight with, you know, your friends,
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.260]   but nothing strains your life more when there's contention
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.500]   between husband and wife.
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.860]   And then, you know, it doesn't stop there.
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.140]   There's nothing more stressful when there's contention
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.620]   between parents and children.
[00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.140]   I mean, the kind of stress that you may feel
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.780]   when the kids are young is very different
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.780]   than you may feel when they get older,
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:28.900]   'cause now you're dealing with an adult.
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.780]   So I'm talking about something that most of you
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.100]   cannot relate to.
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:37.100]   But, you know, one of the most tangible evidences
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:41.860]   of the fact that you and I are living under, you know,
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.940]   an umbrella of condemnation is the strained relationships
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:45.780]   that we have.
[00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.860]   And so it says, for parents who have children,
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.900]   no matter how great, how successful you are, right,
[00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.860]   no matter how great everything else is going,
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.140]   but if your home is not at peace,
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.140]   if your children are not walking with God,
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:05.180]   none of that stuff is gonna matter in the end.
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.860]   And we try so hard to either bring them to Christ,
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:10.140]   to educate them, to do what's best for them.
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.020]   So when he says, when restoration comes
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.700]   and the curse is reversed, you know,
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.460]   the things that causes the most contention,
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.740]   the greatest burden in the lives of people,
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.220]   he's going to restore that.
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.540]   It's no longer gonna be up to us.
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.380]   God himself is going to write his laws in their hearts.
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.780]   So all of this is, again, point by point,
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.180]   a reversal of the curse that we saw
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.220]   that came into mankind in Genesis three.
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.060]   (water splashing)
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:45.500]   I'll give you a minute to write all this down
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.820]   before we jump in.
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:51.060]   (water splashing)
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.900]   (papers rustling)
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.380]   So as you're writing, just kind of, you know, listen.
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.740]   As I said in the beginning,
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:29.420]   chapter 55 is ultimately the main point of salvation.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:35.220]   The point of his sacrifice
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.340]   is God being faithful to his covenant,
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:41.580]   that he becomes the husband, restores.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.740]   He protects us.
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.740]   He places us in place of peace.
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.420]   Our children are taken care of.
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:55.940]   But ultimately, the invitation is the same, is to come,
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.900]   which we cannot do.
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.660]   Without chapter 53, he can't tell sinners to come to him.
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:07.700]   What would happen if God told sinners to come to him
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.300]   in their state?
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.200]   What would happen?
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.940]   You ever see Raiders of the Lost Ark?
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.860]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.020]   You ever see Raiders of the Lost Ark?
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.100]   If you haven't seen it, see it,
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.540]   so you understand what I'm talking about.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:26.620]   Remember they open up that ark?
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:27.820]   I mean, it's not biblical.
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.940]   I mean, don't think, that's not the Bible,
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.380]   but just to kind of give you a picture, right?
[00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.820]   Sinners cannot behold the holy God and live.
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.860]   Chapter 55 can't happen without chapter 53.
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.140]   It's because the son of God absorbed our sins,
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.260]   he's able to tell sinners to come to me.
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.900]   He can't give sinners in their state
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.020]   an invitation to come to him.
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.700]   We can't go to him, right?
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.460]   So if you look at it, I think here's,
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.980]   when Jesus was about to go to the cross,
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.740]   he said, "Where I go, you cannot come," right?
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.500]   And he said, "Well, why can't I go, you know, do this?"
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.300]   And then he gives the last commandment
[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.220]   that he gives to them, or last of the I am statement,
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.580]   and the last I am statement is, "I am divine," right?
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.180]   No one can bear fruit without me.
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.060]   And he keeps telling them to remain.
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.460]   If you want to bear fruit, remain.
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.100]   After I go, you need to remain, right?
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.300]   The disciples are ready to go, you know?
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.100]   If you go, wherever you go, we're gonna go.
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.380]   You're gonna go to Jerusalem, we're gonna go, right?
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.820]   And then even after he resurrects, in Acts chapter one,
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.700]   the disciples are like, "Now, you know, is it now?
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.100]   "Are we gonna go and do it now?"
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.500]   Remember what he says?
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.780]   He said, "Wait until the Holy Spirit comes upon you.
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.820]   "Then when the Holy Spirit comes, you will be my witnesses
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:45.840]   "in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria,
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.020]   "to the remotest part of the world."
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:52.300]   But the first invitation that he gives to his disciples
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.380]   when he first meets them at the end of the ministry
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.540]   and at the beginning of the Great Commissioner sending out,
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.700]   what's the first thing he tells them?
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.540]   Is to come.
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.780]   I think we get into trouble when we think like,
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.800]   "Oh, I'm not right with God.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.440]   "Like, what should I be doing, right?
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.280]   "What mission?
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.320]   "Who do I need to evangelize?
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.300]   "Like, I need to go."
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.260]   But really, I think most people need to heed
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.940]   his first commandment, to come.
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:21.200]   Part of the reason why we're not evangelizing
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.660]   is because we're not remaining in him.
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.260]   If you're not remaining in him,
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.060]   if you're not listening to him,
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.320]   if you're not being fed in him,
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.420]   then evangelism just becomes a check-off thing
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:34.420]   that you need to do.
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.960]   Fellowship is just one of the four spokes
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.680]   in the wheel of life that you need to get done,
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.960]   to balance, you need to balance my wheel.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.400]   So I gotta do this, I gotta do more.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.400]   I haven't had enough fellowship,
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.920]   I gotta go do more fellowship.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.440]   I haven't prayed enough, I gotta do more prayer,
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.440]   more word, more of this.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.400]   And it becomes nothing more than just trying
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.400]   to balance our wheel life, okay?
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.280]   Some of you guys don't know what wheel life is.
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.600]   I apologize, okay?
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.800]   Look that up too, while you're at it, okay?
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.140]   Yeah, so I wanted to highlight this
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.220]   because if you look at chapter 55,
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.180]   over and over, and he said,
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:13.240]   "Come, listen diligently," verse two,
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.880]   "Delight yourself in rich food.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.020]   "Come and be fed in me.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.700]   "Incline your ears here and to seek."
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.200]   So the first duty of a follower of Christ
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.420]   is to have an intimate relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.420]   So if you're not being fed,
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.980]   if you're not satisfied in Christ,
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.620]   if you're not, if you're not,
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.020]   if you're coming and your worship is just,
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.940]   you know, just going through the motion,
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.260]   then our concern shouldn't be,
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.880]   "What should I be doing for God?"
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.280]   That shouldn't be our primary concern, right?
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.460]   Because that's what the scripture says.
[00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:52.520]   First and foremost, come, listen, eat.
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.720]   So again, what's a famous quote from a famous pastor
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.180]   that kind of summarizes this?
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:05.260]   "He is most," no, "He is," right?
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:12.620]   "God is most glorified when we are the most satisfied."
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.780]   So you know it, right?
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.620]   Yeah, I mean, it may sound like a cliche,
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:21.660]   but that phrase that John Piper articulated
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:25.460]   pretty much summarizes everything that God calls us to do,
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.020]   first and foremost, right?
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.860]   We get caught up in too much, like, what we need to do.
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.060]   We need to do this, we need to do that,
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.740]   and the next thing you know, right,
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.460]   you're like, "What am I doing this for?"
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.220]   God, let me say this before we move on,
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.580]   because, you know, I have a little bit more time today.
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:46.740]   What God is looking for is worshipers,
[00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:51.020]   not doers, but worshipers.
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.460]   So whatever you are doing,
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.480]   if you're not doing it out of worship,
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.480]   it is absolutely useless in the kingdom.
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.660]   That's why he says, "Whatever you do, do it without," what?
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:05.620]   Grumbling, because as soon as you start grumbling,
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.060]   you're not worshiping, you're just doing.
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:14.100]   The Old Testament has sacrifices that are mandatory,
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.900]   because you can't come to God without making whole offering,
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.620]   without, you know, grain offering,
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.160]   sin offering, guilt offering.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:24.740]   You can't come to God without making these offerings, right?
[00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:28.480]   But the mandatory offering was committed,
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.000]   was given in Christ.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.660]   So there is no other sacrifices that are needed
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.340]   for us to come to God.
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.460]   But in the Old Testament,
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.120]   there's also another set of offering
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.300]   called the free will offering.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:43.020]   Free will offering is when you are inspired and say,
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.860]   "I wanna thank God and give this as an offering to God."
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:46.940]   It was not required.
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.980]   You came and gave that as an act of worship.
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.020]   So when you come to the New Testament,
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.920]   there is no mandatory offering which says,
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.380]   "If you don't make this offering, you can't know me.
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.540]   You can't come to me."
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.260]   Right?
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.700]   That's why he says he gives his son,
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.620]   he gives everything that we need,
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.900]   and then he says, "Now live up to the calling
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.740]   that you have received."
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.100]   God already gave it to you.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.440]   The sacrifices that you need to come to God
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.740]   has been given to you already,
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.700]   so now the act of what we give to him,
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.220]   the sacrifice that we give to him,
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.620]   is an act of worship.
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:22.780]   So in other words, the free will offering.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.520]   That's why when we begin to say,
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.920]   "If you're a true Christian,
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.620]   you need to have these 10 things."
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.780]   And then you start going around,
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.320]   it's like, "I did this, this, this, and this."
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.160]   And if you're not careful,
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.220]   you're no longer worshiping God.
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.920]   You're just jumping through hoops.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.840]   It's not an act of worship.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.480]   Whether you're cleaning, whether you're singing,
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.720]   whether you're setting up chairs or leading a small group,
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.760]   or just loving your brothers and sisters in Christ,
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.180]   not because God's gonna shake his hand and say,
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.400]   "If you don't do it,
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.920]   I'm not gonna bless your life."
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.400]   We do it because God's love inspires us.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.920]   His love compels us.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:04.400]   So what God is looking for are not doers.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.760]   What he's looking for are worshipers
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.860]   who are worshiping in spirit and in truth.
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:14.520]   That's why a Christian life,
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.160]   our whole life is a free will offering to God.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.480]   And that's the difference between a bunch of people
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.680]   who are whatever we're doing,
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.520]   that we're doing because I volunteered to do it.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.560]   I wasn't made to do it, I volunteered to do it
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.560]   because I'm doing it as an act of worship to God.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.320]   Not because someone's gonna yell at me if I don't do it.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:38.800]   That's why he says, "Come, listen."
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.280]   The call of restoration is not to figure out what to do
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.880]   or where to go, but to come and eat and listen first.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:46.940]   First and foremost.
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:50.160]   Every once in a while somebody asks,
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.400]   "What's the most important quality that you look for
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.960]   in somebody who wants to go into full-time ministry?"
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.440]   What would you look for?
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:03.240]   Think about it, what would you look for?
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.080]   Integrity?
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.340]   That's not necessary.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:09.320]   (laughing)
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.520]   Just seeing if you're paying attention, okay?
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.080]   Of course you need integrity.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:18.120]   Word of God?
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.280]   Of course you need the word of God.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.720]   I would say, again, this is just my opinion
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.000]   and from my observation,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.160]   there has to be a hunger for Christ.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.880]   There has to be a hunger for Christ.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.880]   Or else, everything that comes out of your mouth
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.760]   is just something you've memorized.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.820]   The whole purpose of ministry
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.600]   is to bring non-Christians to Christ.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.080]   The whole purpose of ministry
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.760]   is to get young Christians to love Christ more.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.440]   So if there isn't a hungering for Christ in your life,
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.240]   I don't care how much Bible you know.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.660]   I don't care how much integrity you have.
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.480]   I don't care how organized you are.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.200]   All of these things are just skills.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.040]   And the fundamental thing that somebody
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.360]   who wants to serve God,
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.040]   again, obviously, we're not just talking
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.040]   about people in ministry,
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.800]   but we're talking about every Christian,
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.360]   but the first thing that anybody absolutely has to have
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:20.240]   before he bears true fruit is a hunger for God.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.560]   Love for Christ.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.020]   Because that's what we're trying to reproduce.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.520]   Love for Christ.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.080]   How can we make him attractive
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.780]   if he's not attractive to us?
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.720]   How can we tell people the greatest commandment
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.560]   is to love the Lord your God
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.040]   with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.520]   if that's not us?
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.180]   So that's why the first invitation,
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.040]   now that the gates have been opened,
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.560]   he doesn't say, "Now the gates have been opened,
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.920]   "now go and tell everybody."
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.840]   He says, "Now the gates have been opened,"
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.180]   he says, "Come, come to me.
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:53.780]   "Come and listen.
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.440]   "Be fed.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:29:00.440]   "Rejoice, worship, celebrate, sing first."
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.640]   And somebody who is worshiping God in spirit and in truth
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.800]   will bear fruit.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.760]   I guarantee you, you'll bear fruit.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.640]   Even if you don't open your mouth.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.900]   You should open your mouth,
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.800]   but even if you don't open your mouth,
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:20.520]   you have no idea how much the quality
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:24.400]   of your worship on Sunday affects non-Christians
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.280]   when they come in.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.820]   I mean, I've heard it so many times.
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:31.300]   They come in and they see the quality of your worship,
[00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:35.220]   that you worshiping God as if you really love him.
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.080]   It's very strange when they see that.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:42.820]   Part of the greatest witness of a born-again Christian
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.740]   is his worship toward God.
[00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.780]   Again, if you've been in ministry long enough,
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:50.180]   I mean, you've probably heard it many times.
[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:51.740]   But yeah, when non-Christians come,
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.100]   it's such a shock because basically,
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.300]   what did the fall of man do?
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.920]   They decided to rebel against God.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.580]   Instead of worshiping the creator, they worship creation.
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.580]   So there's no other place where they go
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.840]   other than in a Christian church
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.420]   where what was lost, they can visually see restored.
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.780]   Right?
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.380]   They're going around worshiping everything,
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:18.180]   worshiping Kobe, worshiping, you know, like whatever.
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.500]   They're going out worshiping everything,
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.860]   but nothing satisfies.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.440]   And all of a sudden, they can't even articulate it,
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.780]   but they come into a room full of people
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:29.100]   where what was lost is restored.
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.100]   And they see it in the worship of people.
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.700]   Now obviously, worship isn't just limited
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.980]   to Sunday morning.
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.780]   But Sunday morning is what they see.
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.540]   So if they see a people who are just going
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.300]   through the motion, they're not seeing worship.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.980]   They're seeing Sunday morning gathering.
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.300]   They're not seeing worship.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:48.380]   But when people are worshiping God,
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.420]   what was lost is restored, and they are able to see that.
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:55.380]   I've actually had a couple, an elderly couple,
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.360]   a long, long time ago, I don't know if anybody
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.420]   in this room remember that,
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.120]   became a Christian because of that.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.500]   They had a son who became a Christian,
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.980]   or two sons became a Christian,
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.380]   got in a car accident, and then our whole church
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.620]   went out to see them, and then they came back,
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.860]   and they were so encouraged by our church coming
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.940]   and supporting them that the parents decided,
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.540]   hey, I wanna go to your church because your community
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.140]   seems like a very loving community.
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.540]   And they came to church, and they ended up
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.320]   becoming a Christian a couple months later,
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:25.800]   and we asked them, what changed your mind?
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.900]   Because their English wasn't that great.
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.300]   They were able to understand some
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:31.700]   and not able to understand.
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:35.260]   But what made the biggest impact in their life was worship.
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.540]   They saw a bunch of people worshiping God,
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.020]   and at that, he didn't believe it, they didn't believe it,
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.340]   but they saw that these people believed it.
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.980]   And that curiosity, that being in the presence
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.380]   of true worship among young people
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:50.020]   was what brought them to Christ.
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:55.420]   So again, worship is the central part
[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:58.260]   of what it means to be a child of God, true worship.
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:05.020]   What does it mean to seek the Lord while he may be found?
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.180]   There are times that God has ordained
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:12.300]   where he calls his people to come and repent.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.380]   So all these verses, you can look it up on your own,
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:17.420]   2 Corinthians 6, one and two, Hebrews 2, three,
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.540]   "Seek the Lord while he may be found," right?
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.380]   As long as it is called today, right?
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.640]   Today is always today.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.980]   But the point he's trying to make is there are seasons
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.900]   where God allows you to be able to come.
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:37.460]   And if you harden your heart and you refuse that,
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.300]   that time is not always there.
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:43.380]   Ask any parent with young children.
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:49.820]   I mean, life is not over, but it's much harder.
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.220]   There's a lot of things that they could have done
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:55.380]   while they were single, and they can't do now, you know?
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:56.620]   And there's a lot of things that you can't do
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.260]   in your 50s and 60s that you can't do now.
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.020]   And then even if you're young, there are periods
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.420]   when God really convicts your heart.
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.220]   And you're really, like God is calling you,
[00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:09.860]   the word of God, that your heart is sensitive to him.
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.780]   And you feel the calling, you're surrounded
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:13.860]   by other brothers and sisters
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.820]   that you're running the race together with.
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.700]   And then you choose and say, "Maybe not now."
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.420]   And you think that somehow later on you can turn it on,
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.520]   and it doesn't happen.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:26.740]   Most people who delay their obedience
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.400]   usually end up disobeying later.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.460]   The reason why is because their hearts become hardened.
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.500]   You don't just decide to soften your heart.
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.420]   So it's the, do you not know that it's the kindness of God
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.040]   that leads you to repentance?
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:42.100]   And that isn't always there.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.980]   Not that his grace isn't always there, right?
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.260]   But we don't have years to hear all the time.
[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:53.660]   He says in verse 11, the reason why
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.700]   is to accomplish God's purpose.
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.540]   Again, this means that those who are not in his word
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.660]   will not participate in the accomplishing of his purpose.
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.900]   So the last question was, list as many things
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:11.140]   that you can think of where he says,
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:13.740]   "My word will go forth and will not return
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:15.740]   "until it has accomplished its purpose."
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:19.500]   So again, I forgot, I didn't say this,
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.060]   but the rain functions to water the earth
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.460]   and bring forth fruit for sustaining a life.
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.380]   And again, he compares that to his word
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:28.460]   in the same way that the word of God goes forth
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.660]   and does not return until it has accomplished its purpose.
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:33.740]   And the purpose of the rain is to bring life, right?
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:34.740]   Bear fruit and bring life.
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:36.300]   And he said that's what God has ordained
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.300]   to bring life, his word, right?
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.140]   So the next question is like,
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:43.460]   what are things that you've jotted down,
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.620]   hopefully you took some time to think about it,
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.620]   maybe did some study and went through the Bible
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.060]   or some verses that kind of stood out to you.
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.900]   What does the Bible say about itself
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:55.600]   and why the Bible is so important?
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.580]   Just kind of blur it out.
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:58.500]   I'm not gonna write it down.
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.200]   You can write it down if you want.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.340]   What is the word of God?
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.020]   Why, what has God ordained the word of God to do?
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:11.460]   - Judge the thoughts and intentions.
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:14.340]   - Judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart, right?
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.860]   Sometimes you can think that you feel like you're doing,
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:18.220]   you know, you're right,
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:21.060]   and then you open up the word of God and convicts, right?
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.120]   Has that ever happened to you?
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.220]   Where you're thinking you're right
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:27.140]   and then the word of God,
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:28.300]   not because somebody told you,
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:33.300]   but the word of God kind of convicted you, right?
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.300]   If that's never happened,
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:36.980]   it's probably 'cause you're not in the word.
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.220]   'Cause the word of God does that all the time.
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:51.740]   Lamp, direction, guidance, right?
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.780]   Now I know a lot of times,
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.860]   like when people come and seek counseling
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.060]   and they want an answer,
[00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:00.740]   like they want a particular Bible verse, right?
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.060]   Like what does the Bible say about dating?
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.820]   There is no one verse, right?
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.460]   Other than be like me, like Paul says,
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.660]   don't get married, right?
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:12.580]   But that's not what you want.
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.420]   That's not what you came for, right?
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:18.480]   So there's no particular verse that points to that.
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.900]   But what does it say in Romans 12, two?
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.380]   Do not be conformed,
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:25.960]   but be transformed by the ruining of your mind.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.580]   Then you will be able to test and approve that
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.260]   which is perfect and pleasing will of God.
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:34.700]   So how are you able to discern the will of God?
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.980]   When your mind is renewed, right?
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:37.820]   With his word.
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.300]   So a lot of times understanding the will of God
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.660]   is not simply getting the right verse
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.060]   to point you to the right direction.
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:48.540]   It's to have a heart and mind that is bent toward God, right?
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.620]   And you're able to discern what is right and wrong
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:53.620]   because your heart and your mind has been transformed
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.340]   by being renewed by his word.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:56.840]   Right?
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.840]   But if your heart and mind is not transformed
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.800]   and all you're looking is for that verse
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.840]   to say right and wrong,
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.440]   majority of the time you're not gonna find it
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.840]   because most of the time God doesn't direct us that way.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.120]   God directs us by changing our hearts, changing our mind.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.860]   So somebody who's not surrendered
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.440]   in other parts of your life
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.520]   is not gonna all of a sudden say,
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.040]   "Hey God, give me your will."
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:25.280]   Because I might, I might obey if you reveal it to me.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.120]   Right?
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.460]   Because all of this other stuff,
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.700]   I'm just doing whatever I want.
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.020]   But when it comes to dating and marriage,
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.780]   I wanna get that right.
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:32.620]   Right?
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:35.300]   So I don't really want directions with my money,
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.420]   but I want direction with my marriage,
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:39.260]   at least in the beginning.
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.140]   Right?
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.660]   And then you're seeking the Lord's will.
[00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.340]   You can't seek the Lord's will like that.
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.700]   If you're not surrendered here,
[00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.580]   your heart's not bent toward God,
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.140]   all of a sudden God's not gonna reveal
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.180]   all this other stuff on this side either.
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.500]   Right?
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.640]   Spiritual things are discerned spiritually.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:59.760]   So the word of God, again, a lamp unto our feet.
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.600]   So we have to be,
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.760]   if you wanna know God's direction and will for your life,
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.600]   before you run to counseling and to other people,
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:11.440]   open the word of God and let it renew your mind.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.800]   First.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.360]   So that whatever counseling you're getting
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.480]   from other people, right?
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.640]   That that's not the word of God.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.080]   Counseling is not the word of God.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.120]   Word of God's the word of God.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.520]   So you need to have the word of God
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.900]   so that you can discern which counseling is from God.
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.000]   What other people are saying,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.440]   what is right and what is wrong?
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.280]   Right?
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.800]   Because if you talk to 10 counselors,
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.440]   10 people will tell you 10 different things.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.280]   Right?
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.520]   So you can't determine what is right and wrong
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.560]   based upon what kind of connection
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.320]   you have with these people.
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.160]   Right and wrong has to be discerned by His word.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.440]   So first and foremost,
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.280]   everyone has a responsibility
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.360]   to be renewed by the word of God first.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.200]   Right?
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.040]   What else?
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:55.840]   - Salvation, like the parable of the sower,
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.720]   or humbly accept the word planted in you
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:59.760]   which can save you.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.600]   - Right.
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.880]   Faith comes from hearing and hearing the word of Christ.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.260]   Right?
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.600]   I think, again, those of you who have been
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.160]   in our church for a while, you know,
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.000]   that we have, there's a lot of techniques
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.160]   and you know, they call it verbal judo
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.720]   that you can have and you know,
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.680]   you can do it to get people to submit
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:18.140]   and get, win arguments and all that.
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:20.640]   But in the end, you can't transform their hearts.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.480]   Right?
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.600]   Conviction of sin comes from the Holy Spirit
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.880]   when the word of God uses His,
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.720]   when the Holy Spirit uses His word of God
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.520]   to convict the world of sin.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.520]   And until that conviction comes,
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.680]   no amount of apologetics is gonna,
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.120]   is gonna bring some people to Christ.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.320]   Right?
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.520]   So salvation, very fundamental thing
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.280]   about our salvation happens when the word of God is taught
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.280]   and heard and convicted.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.240]   Right?
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.080]   What else?
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:51.000]   (faintly speaking)
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:58.840]   Okay, for our own sanctification.
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:59.680]   Right?
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.360]   So again, we can have accountability.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.560]   Accountability is important,
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.840]   but accountability to somebody who is,
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.800]   just wants to look like he's doing well, does nothing.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.120]   Can, can, can accountability stop you from watching porn?
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.480]   It can stop you from watching porn in a certain,
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.480]   in a certain venue.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.320]   Right?
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:27.200]   You have no idea what I'm talking about.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.700]   Accountability itself is not gonna cause you to grow.
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.080]   Right?
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.080]   'Cause if you wanna sin,
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.840]   you can work around accountability.
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:38.820]   In fact, you don't even have to tell the truth.
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:40.560]   Just be vague.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:43.040]   Somebody asks you, "Did you watch porn?"
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:43.880]   It's like, "Yeah, I've been,
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.040]   "I've been kind of struggling with purity."
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:49.760]   Well, that could be watching an ad.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.840]   That could be like 10 hours of pornography.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:52.800]   I mean, that's so vague.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:53.800]   Like, what do you mean by that?
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.400]   It's like, "Yeah, just struggling."
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.280]   So if your heart is not bent toward God
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.280]   and the word of God is not what's guiding you,
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.720]   even accountability is not gonna sanctify you.
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:04.600]   Right?
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.800]   Peer pressure is not going to cause you to grow.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:08.640]   Right?
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.680]   Sanctification happens when we expose our lives
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.480]   and our heart to the word of God.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.440]   Because we're attracted to him.
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.720]   Right?
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.400]   So our very sanctity, our salvation,
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.000]   our sanctification, what else?
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:25.520]   I think Harry had his hand up.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.840]   - No, I was thinking about the same verse,
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.320]   but I also think about your word,
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.280]   "I've treasured my heart that I will not sin against you."
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.440]   So it's a way for us to examine ourselves.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.280]   - Right.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.100]   - To not sin against God.
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:35.940]   - Right.
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.520]   So preventing us from sinning.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.560]   But even that, right, if we're not careful,
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.360]   does memorizing help you not to sin?
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.200]   Yes.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.400]   It helps us not to sin.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.360]   Does it prevent you from not sinning?
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.640]   No.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:48.480]   Right?
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.720]   Just memorizing scripture doesn't make,
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.240]   I memorized scripture, so you don't have to worry about me.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.080]   Right?
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.720]   Because when you choose to sin, you'll turn it off.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.040]   Right?
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.320]   Just like you don't want a pastor going with you
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.920]   to watch an inappropriate movie.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.640]   Right?
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.360]   You want me to go watch Finding Nemo with you,
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.480]   but not the other stuff.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:11.840]   So you can turn off accountability if you don't want it.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.240]   You can memorize scripture, and then if you want to sin,
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.440]   you just block it out of your head.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.440]   So to help you from not sinning,
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.600]   but it's not gonna prevent you from sinning.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.440]   Right?
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.880]   So all of these things are things that God has placed
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.880]   out there, and just like salvation,
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:33.880]   he speaks, my sheep hear my voice and they follow me.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.640]   Why would people come to him?
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:38.640]   Because we want to.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.960]   Because we want to.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.000]   Because that's where I find life.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.920]   Right?
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.440]   Why would people not want to sin?
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.280]   Because people are gonna look at me weird.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.560]   Like, I mean, that'll get us to jump through hoops,
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.160]   but that's not gonna change you.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:58.800]   What's gonna change you is you heard the voice
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.800]   of your master, and that's what you want.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.440]   Like, that's what you want.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.400]   And that's why you seek accountability.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.400]   Right?
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.240]   That's why you get to the Bible.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.360]   That's why you memorize scripture,
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.840]   because you find more life in him
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.440]   than you find in anything else in this world.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.280]   Right?
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.240]   That's why we come to him.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.680]   And what has he ordained to do this?
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:20.520]   His word.
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.920]   Faith comes from hearing,
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:24.960]   and the hearing of the word of Christ.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.880]   When the word of God gets into your heart,
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:30.920]   gets into your mind, and God begins to draw you to himself,
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.680]   he says, "The God of this age is blind to the mind
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.520]   "of the unbeliever, so that you do not see the glory
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.340]   "of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.160]   "But once the word of God causes you
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:42.960]   "to be opened in your eyes," right?
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.720]   And it's not just one time you're open,
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:48.060]   it's a continual calling, 'cause that's what I want.
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:54.040]   What causes you to come here week after week?
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.340]   Now, there's all kinds of reasons why people can come.
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:59.340]   You can come because there's friendship here,
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.640]   you can come because you like football,
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.500]   you know, you come because you got nothing to do
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:06.960]   on Wednesday, I mean, there are all kinds of reasons
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.240]   why you would come, right?
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:13.240]   And sometimes we forget, because we're so duty-bound.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:16.900]   As a Christian, you're supposed to do this, right?
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.840]   So you're doing what you're supposed to do.
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:23.320]   And sometimes you forget that what God wants from you
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:26.780]   is for you to want this, right?
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.120]   For you, you come study the Bible
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.420]   because you want to study the Bible.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.160]   You pray not because you're supposed to pray,
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.400]   because you want to have fellowship with God.
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:40.800]   Until we recognize the want to in our hearts,
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.180]   we can no longer be true worshipers,
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:46.440]   'cause that's not worship, right?
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:50.340]   And that's why the Word of God is so important.
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:53.300]   And again, those of you who've been in our church for a while
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:56.500]   you know that that's the underlying principle
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:01.500]   of how we do discipleship, how we do training, whatever,
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:05.080]   is that our primary source of doing that
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.900]   is the Word of God, right?
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:10.500]   Now, does that mean that everybody's gonna respond
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.540]   when the Word of God is taught?
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:12.940]   Absolutely not.
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:17.260]   But I believe true fruit will always come
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:18.660]   when the Word of God goes forth,
[00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:21.660]   and people who hear His voice from the Word of God,
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:24.260]   and they begin to get attracted and come to Him,
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.380]   that that's true fruit, right?
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:29.660]   They're not trying to please anybody,
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.500]   there's no peer pressure, there's no knocking ahead,
[00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:35.320]   it's just they want Christ, right?
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.320]   And just like he said, what's the point of the Word of God?
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.520]   The Word of God goes forth, he said, "Trust my word."
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.400]   'Cause there's times when we can begin to think,
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.880]   well, the Word of God is not working, right?
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.920]   Especially in our generation.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.120]   If you just teach the Word of God, who's gonna come?
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:53.080]   Right?
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:55.080]   'Cause I mean, you hear that all over our generation.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.080]   So people are moving away from Bible study,
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.680]   because it doesn't work.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.640]   People don't wanna come to church if it's Bible study,
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:04.360]   because it's not exciting, it's not fun, right?
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:08.360]   And that may be true, you know, absolutely true.
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.960]   There's a whole bunch of things that we can do
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:13.680]   to attract more people, and get people to do more things.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.480]   But that's not why we're here.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.740]   We're here to call people to Christ.
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:22.000]   And Christ said, the way that I want you
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.120]   to call people to Christ is preach what?
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:28.080]   The Word, in season, and what?
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:28.960]   Out of season.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.000]   Whether they respond or don't respond.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.120]   Whether you see immediate fruit,
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.920]   or don't see immediate fruit.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.200]   And isn't that why he's telling them this?
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.320]   He said, my word goes forth, does not return
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.360]   until it has accomplished its purpose.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.200]   Why does he have to remind them that?
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.640]   Because sometimes it seems like it's not working.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.320]   Right?
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.360]   Sometimes it seems like it's not working,
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.280]   but that's why he says, never,
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.360]   when the Word of God goes forth,
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.680]   it will never return until it has accomplished my purpose.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.960]   So maybe God may go send his word
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.380]   to harden people's heart, who knows?
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:06.100]   Maybe it is to be sent out to judge people, who knows?
[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.400]   But he didn't give us 10 different things.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.720]   He didn't give the church,
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.580]   try these 10 things and see what sticks.
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:15.520]   He gave us one thing.
[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.120]   The church is the pillar and foundation of the truth.
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:22.760]   The church is to be the heralder of the Word of God,
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.640]   to preach it in season and out of season.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.560]   So there are seasons when you will preach the Word of God,
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.440]   and people will leave because you're preaching
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.360]   the Word of God.
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.920]   And there are people will be bored out of their mind
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.240]   because the Word of God is being taught.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.800]   And then there are seasons when people will fall in love
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.400]   with Christ because of the Word.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:40.560]   But God did not give us 10 different methods
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.080]   to bring people to Christ.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:45.400]   He didn't give us 10 different methods to sanctify people.
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.200]   He gave us his word.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.680]   So we stick with that in season and out of season.
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:55.000]   All right, I've gone over my time,
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:01.020]   but I think it was an important part of the section.
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:02.920]   But I wanna lead you in a time of worship,
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:04.880]   even though it's gonna go a little bit.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:07.540]   (water running)
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:10.200]   (water running)
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.040]   (water splashing)
