[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   We're going to be reading through the end of the chapter, but mainly on the first part
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.280]   of it this week, and then we'll get into the second part next week.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.520]   Let me read from verse 11 through verse 17 before we get started.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.040]   Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood, for on the basis of it the people
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.680]   received the law, what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.760]   order of Melchizedek and not be designated according to the order of Aaron?
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.400]   For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.440]   For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.900]   no one has officiated at the altar.
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.480]   For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.200]   Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.560]   And this is clear still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek,
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.400]   who has become such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.100]   to the power of an indestructible life.
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.640]   For it is attested of him, you are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.520]   Let's pray.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.400]   Gracious Father, we pray for your blessing over this time, and we pray, Father God, that
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.240]   our hearts and our mind are so easily entangled with the things of this world.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.280]   I pray that your word would continue to guide and lead us, that we would hear your Son's
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.880]   voice, that your children will know it, recognize it, and follow it, Lord God.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.400]   I pray for your anointing this time, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.780]   You know, at the beginning of the pandemic, I remember I was given a devotion that I posted
[00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.440]   online and I mentioned how, you know, with all the things that I've seen and experienced
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.800]   in the years that I've been a Christian, that, I mean, this is one of the craziest
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.800]   things that I've experienced.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.640]   And I remember saying that I don't know if this is the end times.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.020]   It's not wise for anybody to say this is it or this is not it, because the Bible says
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.740]   we would not know.
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.600]   But if it does begin, I would think like this is how it would feel, you know, at least the
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   beginning part of it.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.200]   And I remember mentioning that and to consider that it's gotten exponentially crazier since
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.240]   then.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.200]   And so I know that I've noticed that online that more and more pastors are at least thinking
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.400]   about it, that if Christ's second coming is near, that this is at least what it would
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.720]   feel like in the beginning part of it.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.400]   If there's any time in my lifetime, and I think the lifetime of most people who are
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.160]   living now, would say that we absolutely need to be anchored in Christ, it would be now.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.920]   With all the crazy things that are going on around us and all the different opinions and
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.600]   the tidal wave of emotions and political opinions and the divide, and oftentimes even coming
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.200]   into the church.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.920]   And you could see how the church can easily be divided, even, you know, within the people
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.720]   that I know that we are so polarized in our opinions on one end to the other, whether
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.240]   it's political, what's going on with the marches, how we feel, what we should say, who do we
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.440]   get involved with, where do we stand.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.800]   And that if we're not careful, if we're not really anchored in Christ, that it can easily
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.080]   divide the church because there's so much strong opinions.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.280]   You know, in the Old Testament, when we're starting to the book of Leviticus, there's
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.360]   five major gifts that the Israelites were to give on a regular basis.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.720]   And out of five, one of them really stands out because it is unlike the other.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.040]   All the other offerings, you give the offerings and then you're done with it.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.280]   But this peace offering was the only offering where you gave the parts where you couldn't
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.720]   eat and then they actually had a picnic.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.560]   So the offer, the priests and the family members who came with them would actually, after giving
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.200]   the sacrifice, would go on the side of the court and then they would have a picnic.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.660]   They would actually eat the sacrifice that they made.
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.640]   And so it signified that vertical peace with God would create this horizontal peace with
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.000]   one another.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.480]   And that was embedded into the Israelites' sacrifice.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.280]   It is only when peace with God is established that there will be peace with mankind.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.640]   We see that even in the Garden of Eden.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.720]   The very first thing that happens once sin enters into mankind, do you remember the story?
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.720]   Remember what happens?
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.840]   The first thing that happens is they recognize their shame and the husband and wife cover
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.840]   each other.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.840]   From who?
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.120]   From each other.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.400]   So contention comes in.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.000]   Shame comes in in this most intimate relationship.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.660]   And so ever since then, there is contention in the heart of man.
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.000]   You know, right now with so much going on with marches and protests and different opinions
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.120]   and articles being written.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.420]   And even oftentimes within the church, one pastor's opinion is so vastly different than
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.680]   another pastor's opinion.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.240]   And even within our church, there's various opinions.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.680]   If there's any period where we have to absolutely be anchored in Christ, it is now.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.280]   When you begin to drift, you don't know you're drifting or you wouldn't be drifting.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.000]   You drift because of the tidal wave that is around you.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.920]   When you're living in a time of peace and the waters are calm, even if you're not anchored,
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.300]   the consequence may not be deadly.
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.800]   You may drift a little bit out and then you recognize, oh, shoot, this is not where I
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.800]   want to be.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.800]   And you might paddle back in.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.080]   But in a time of storm, if you drift even a little bit, if you don't pay attention for
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:47.240]   even a little bit, because the currents are so strong, you don't even know that you're
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.480]   headed into danger until it's already too late.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:59.540]   I think we're in one of those periods where if Christians, no matter what level of maturity,
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:05.080]   if you're not seriously anchoring yourself in Christ, if you're not carefully clinging
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:12.440]   to Christ, without making any decision, without drawing any lines, you will head toward a
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.120]   certain direction.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.600]   In Ephesians chapter 2, 14 through 16, scripture says, "For he himself is our peace," talking
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.480]   about Christ, "who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.480]   wall."
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.340]   Now, you think that Republicans and Democrats have a divide.
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:37.440]   If you study how the Jews and the Gentiles hated each other, I mean, they hated each
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.140]   other to the point where just being in their vicinity, they felt like they became unclean.
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.000]   They would travel days around a particular city just so that they don't have to step
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.060]   into Gentile land.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:54.480]   You would never see a Gentile in a Jewish home or a Jew in a Gentile home.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.620]   That's how much they hated each other.
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:02.360]   So when he says, "Jesus is our peace," and he took away the barrier, again, you have
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.060]   to understand that within the context of how radical that is.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.740]   That if you fell asleep for about five, six years and woke up and you saw the Gentiles
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.280]   and the Jews worshiping in the same church, calling each other brothers and sisters in
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.260]   Christ, you would have thought something crazy happened, which it did.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.360]   Only the resurrection of Christ could have brought these two groups together.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:30.740]   Right now, the opinions and the divide in our country is so vast that if we don't pay
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.760]   attention, what happens outside the church is beyond our control.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.980]   But if we're not careful, it can easily divide the church.
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.960]   He said, verse 15, "By abolishing in his flesh the enmity which is the law of the commandments
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:50.340]   contained in ordinances, so that in himself he might make the two into one new man, thus
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:56.280]   establishing peace, and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross,
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.740]   by it having put to death the enmity."
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:05.000]   Again, the only peace that you and I believe and profess and sing every single Sunday is
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.220]   that we find peace in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.340]   In Hebrews chapter 10, verse 1, it says, "For the law, since it has only a shadow of the
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.880]   good things to come, and not the very form of things, can never by the same sacrifices
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.060]   which they offer continually, year by year, make perfect those who draw near."
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:30.780]   Now, he said the sacrifices of the Old Testament were never meant for the purpose of curing
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.480]   anything.
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.900]   It was to point to something.
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.620]   So it's kind of like, you know, maybe some of you guys who have young children may have
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:47.060]   taken your kids to Home Depot, you know, and teach them how to use the saw or the electric
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.380]   drill, but obviously they're toys.
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.040]   They're made out of plastic.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.340]   And then they would pretend like they're cutting things.
[00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.380]   And why do they do that?
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.960]   Obviously, you know, from Home Depot's perspective, hopefully you'll become their customers at
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.760]   some point, right?
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.760]   But the reason why they do that is to teach them how to use these tools.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.580]   But these tools that they're using is not real.
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:13.740]   It's only so that they can learn when they are old enough to be able to use the real
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.700]   tools to be able to cut real wood and build real stuff.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:23.400]   But as they are children, they are given these things so that you turn this on.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.020]   This is how you are safe, and this is what you do, and this is how you put it away.
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:31.320]   All of this so that when they are old enough, they can handle the real tools.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.080]   In and of itself has no power.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.900]   But imagine if they became older and they say, "You know what?
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:41.380]   You know, I really like my plastic saw and this fake drill makes the 'ang' sound, and
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.720]   I want that."
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:50.180]   The whole point of chapter 7 is to tell us that the whole old system, they were plastic.
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.220]   It has no power to bring any kind of salvation.
[00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.980]   It was only there as a shadow to point to the reality that was coming in Christ.
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.100]   Now, some of us may sit here and think, "You know what?
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.440]   That sounds great, and that's good theology, but we're not Jews.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.980]   We were never under the old system.
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.940]   So it's good to know, but it's not relevant to us."
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.660]   Well, we may not have ever been under the Old Testament law, but the principle that
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.820]   he teaches is no different today.
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:26.780]   When we think that somehow our religious activity is going to have some kind of power to bring
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:32.020]   about true salvation, it's no different than a Jew thinking that if they make the right
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.520]   sacrifices that somehow they can be saved.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.500]   You and I know that you can attend church all your life and not be saved.
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.980]   You know that you can be a leader in the church and not be saved.
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.140]   You can go to short-term missions.
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:52.980]   You can do all kinds of stuff in the church and engage in religious activity and have
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.820]   no idea what it means to be a follower of Jesus Christ, because in and of itself has
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.980]   no power.
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:05.100]   Religious activity, changing the system, has no power.
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:10.220]   He says in Hebrews 7-11, the first verse that we're looking at, "Now if perfection was through
[00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.500]   the Levitical priesthood, for on the basis of it the people received the law, what further
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:19.780]   need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek and
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.980]   not be designated according to the order of Aaron?"
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:26.160]   In other words, why do we need Jesus?
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.960]   If you're a Jew thinking, "We have this system.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.820]   We have all these things that we're doing and making sacrifices.
[00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.900]   Why do we need another priest to come to mediate?"
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:42.660]   The point is, if Jesus was just fulfilling what they were doing in the Old Testament,
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.660]   we don't need one.
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:48.060]   In fact, he doesn't even fit, because he doesn't come from the tribe of Levi.
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:54.680]   But the whole point that he's trying to make is that the system that you are relying on
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.680]   is useless.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.740]   It has no power to make someone perfect.
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.780]   The word for perfect is a really rich theological term in the New Testament.
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.660]   In fact, when I was in seminary, I did a whole paper just on this word.
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.260]   It's a very significant word.
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:13.220]   The word here, obviously in English, it means something without defect.
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.200]   It does have that word.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   It does have that meaning.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:22.060]   But the term teleos, perfect, has a greater meaning behind it.
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:29.140]   The meaning that is often used in the scripture is to bring about to the desired end of that
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.140]   goal.
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:36.940]   Meaning, if somebody started a race and he finishes that race, he's achieved perfection.
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:42.140]   If you had a goal of starting a business and you started getting the loan, and when you
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.880]   finally purchase it and start the business, you've received perfection.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:52.240]   Whatever your end goal is, when you achieve it, it's called perfection.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.480]   That's the theological connotation of this word teleos.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:03.960]   So when he says the old system has no power to bring about perfection, meaning God's redemptive
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:11.040]   history of what God is doing with mankind, that old religious sacrificial system has
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:19.280]   no power to bring about salvation of anybody.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:25.040]   So we need to know then, if the old system, if religious activity has no power to bring
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:32.040]   about the end goal of what God desires, what is the end goal that God desires?
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:38.880]   If we don't know what God desires, what his end goal is, you can be at church and be memorizing
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:46.160]   scripture, be active, leading worship, leading Bible study, and still miss the whole point.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.520]   Because you could have been the most moral person, you could have been the most giving
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:57.560]   person, you could have been the most disciplined person, but it had nothing to do with perfection.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.800]   You didn't get to what God's intention is.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:07.480]   See, he says in Hebrews 7 verse 19, "For the law made nothing perfect, and on the other
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:14.240]   hand there is bringing in of a better hope through which we draw near to God."
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.920]   So what is the end goal of our salvation?
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.520]   To bring us near to God.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.520]   That's the end goal.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.720]   Again, you and I know that you can come to church all your life and never get closer
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.560]   to God.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:35.320]   You can study the Bible and know the intentions of what the Bible says, and you've never drawn
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.080]   any closer to God than the first day that you were at church.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:45.520]   You can teach the Bible, you can share the gospel, you can lead, and never draw near
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.520]   to God.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:52.080]   You know, a lot of people come to Christ because they want to fill this emptiness, or they
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:57.880]   feel lonely, or something is missing in their life, and so the church fulfills that.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:02.320]   So church is very important to them, but for the wrong reason.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.240]   Some people come to church because they want to find purpose.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.040]   They feel empty.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.200]   They have money.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.500]   They have friends.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.920]   But I need some kind of purpose.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:17.520]   So you come to church and you find some direction and purpose in your life, and the church is
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.000]   good for that.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.960]   But you completely missed the point.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.720]   Or for some people, life is hard.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:29.160]   You've gone through some hardship, and it's good to have a Savior that loves you unconditionally.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.480]   And so the church serves that purpose, so you come to church.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.760]   Or a lot of people come to church because they don't want to go to hell.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.360]   Just in case that there's a hell, I want to make sure that I have proper insurance.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:47.200]   So they come to church and it fulfills that, and it's not hard to do because this is where
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:52.880]   my friends are, my kids grow up together, good morals are taught, this is where I feel
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.600]   purpose and direction.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:02.880]   All of these things may be fulfilled in the church and never find perfection.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.080]   Because that was not the purpose of the church to begin with.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.480]   All of those things are byproducts of the church.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.280]   But not the end goal.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:17.360]   The end goal in 1 Peter 3, it says, "For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.600]   for the unjust, so that he might bring us to God."
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.880]   Why did Jesus die?
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:30.240]   Why did the just experience injustice to bring the unjust to salvation?
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.360]   So that he may bring us to God.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:37.420]   So the whole point is to restore our relationship with God.
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:42.400]   Because the Bible says in the book of Acts, he says, "For in him we live and move and
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.600]   have our being."
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.040]   In him.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:51.880]   So if you're not reconnected with the author of life, you may find an alternate life in
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.320]   the church, you may find an alternate life outside the church, but it has nothing to
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.720]   do with perfection.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.000]   It has nothing to do with God's end goal.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.480]   And that's why people can be at church all their life and at the end when they stand
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:07.640]   before Christ and he said, "You call me Lord, Lord, but your heart was never with me.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.040]   Had nothing to do with me.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:15.920]   All your activity, all the Bible study, all the church had nothing to do with me."
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.000]   Because we missed the whole point.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.280]   You know, you could be a great student and spent hundreds of hours doing a paper on Abraham
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.840]   Lincoln and you think you're going to get an A+ and then you come to the professor and
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:33.280]   he said, "No, I wanted a paper on George Washington."
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.520]   Now if it was on Abraham Lincoln, you would have gotten A+++.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:43.160]   But because it was on Lincoln, you got an F. It had nothing to do with what the professor
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.160]   wanted.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.040]   So, we missed this point of what God wants.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:53.880]   God's whole purpose and why he did what he did, why he's doing what he is doing, and
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.160]   why he will continue to do what he continues to do.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.180]   All our efforts could easily be for nothing.
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.320]   And he says, "Your whole old system has no power."
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.760]   It doesn't say it has some power, but it's not enough.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.600]   He says, "No, it has no power."
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:18.160]   In fact, the term he uses is worthless and useless when it comes to bringing us to Christ.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.640]   The end goal is to have this relationship restored.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.440]   That's why if you look at verse 12 through 16, it describes how Jesus Christ comes in
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.480]   a completely different priesthood.
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.880]   And when there is a change of priesthood, there's a change of law.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.640]   And he doesn't come in the order of Aaron.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.220]   In fact, his priesthood is completely different.
[00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:43.400]   So the whole point of verse 12 and 16, whole point of it is he's saying it's completely
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.400]   useless.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.480]   There needs to be a whole different system.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.480]   Now why is this relevant?
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:57.040]   It's relevant because anything that you and I have confidence in, that we think somehow
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:05.120]   if we do a better job, if we can market the church better, if we can organize better,
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:10.440]   or if we can change the system, have the right leaders, if we can just tweak certain things
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.280]   that we can have what God desires.
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:18.560]   He says, "No, that old system, you can have the best priest, best organization.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.280]   You can have the best animals, best sacrifices.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:28.200]   You can have the best temple, but it would still be useless because all of it was simply
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:36.720]   a shadow to point to what was to come in reality of Christ."
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.360]   At some point, everybody drives a car, and at some point you try to fix this and fix
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.360]   that.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.600]   At some point you have to make a decision, you cannot salvage this.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.620]   And so once you go up to that point, you have to buy a new car.
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:56.380]   You change the tires, the alternator, everything that you could possibly do, but at some point
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.960]   you cannot salvage the car.
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:04.000]   Well, that's what's happening here in Hebrews chapter 7 because the Jews are drifting back
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   to their old system.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.520]   He said, "You do not know that there's nothing to salvage there.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.680]   It's finished."
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:15.920]   And when he is saying that there's nothing to salvage there, that it is finished, he's
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.880]   not just talking about Old Testament system.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.440]   For the Jews, that's what they were clinging to.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:31.040]   Whatever worldly principles, whatever worldly leaderships, whatever legal institutions that
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:38.380]   you think that if you can just tweak it, you can bring heaven on earth, you missed the
[00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.920]   whole point.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:45.380]   All of creation, all of it has been tainted.
[00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:52.920]   If we put our confidence and hope in anything else outside of Christ, you will be disappointed.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:58.340]   Now he explains why they are worthless and useless in the coming verses.
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.100]   First of all, the old priesthood was weak and useless because the priests were weak
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.100]   and useless.
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:09.240]   He said the priesthood came without an oath, without an oath meaning that God didn't appoint
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.240]   them.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.640]   God just created a system and then you were born into it.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:18.960]   So these mediators that was mediating for the nation of Israel and the world, basically
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.520]   they were men because they were just born as a Levite in Hebrews 7, 20 to 21.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.520]   As much as it was not without an oath, for they indeed became priests without an oath.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.480]   In other words, they were just born into it.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:37.200]   So imagine what the country would be like if every president became president because
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.500]   you were born in the right family.
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:44.680]   You might have some good presidents and you might have some horrible presidents.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:49.000]   So that's what he's saying, the weakness of the system is they're not even anointed.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.120]   They just came into being.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.320]   But not only do they come in like that, every single one of them is limited because they're
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.320]   going to die.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.640]   Hebrews chapter 7, 23.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.680]   The former priests on the one hand existed in greater numbers because they were prevented
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.000]   by death from continuing.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:13.520]   So just by the limitation of the priests themselves points to the limitation of the priesthood.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.280]   So again, I want you guys to be able to bridge the gap.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.680]   I don't want to get you in the mindset, it's like, "Oh, you know, those are talking about
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.360]   Jews and I've never worshipped at the temple so this is not relevant to me."
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:34.720]   This is as relevant as it can get because what he is saying is any human system, anything
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:41.600]   that is dependent upon human beings, whether it is government, relationship, counseling,
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:50.180]   finance, whatever it may be, it will always be limited by that human being.
[00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.520]   And the priesthood will also be limited because of that.
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.940]   And so their finiteness pointed to the finiteness of the system.
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:04.960]   But the real reason why it was weak and useless is because the priest's own weakness and sins.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.280]   Hebrews chapter 2, 27, it says, "Like those high priests to offer up sacrifices first
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.440]   for his own sins."
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:18.400]   Even though he was appointed, a priest was appointed to mediate for the sins of the people,
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.200]   he himself was a sinner.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.020]   He himself was a criminal.
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.880]   So he had no power within himself.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:34.720]   You know, there's a story about some young people who went up to a camping trip and a
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.960]   lot of times, you know, when they get to a camping trip late at night, they'll tell
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.240]   scary stories to each other.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.040]   And then they told stories about ghosts and things.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.880]   So at the end of the camping trip, late at night, they're coming home and one of the
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:50.220]   girls who were coming home remembered these stories and she got freaked out.
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.920]   She parked her car far from her apartment and so she was walking and then she heard
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.320]   strange noises and she turned around and she saw a white ghost behind her and she freaked
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.320]   out.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.320]   She was already scared.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.680]   So she started running as fast as she could.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.040]   Then after a while, she doesn't hear anything.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.480]   So, "Oh, I must have run away from that."
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.480]   So she turned around.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.960]   She didn't know where the ghost was.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.120]   Again, right behind her.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.240]   She runs as fast as she could.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.280]   And then after a while, she said, "Surely, you know, she's a track star.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.960]   So she must have outrun this ghost."
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.680]   And she turns around right there.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.040]   Right there.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.240]   She didn't gain a foot.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.800]   So she ran into her apartment, closed the door, locked the door, went to the bathroom
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.320]   and locked the door thinking, "Oh my gosh, what am I going to do?"
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:34.160]   And then she looks into the mirror and she sees a little piece of white rice right on
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.160]   the tip of her eyes.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.160]   Okay.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.560]   Most of you are Korean.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.720]   This sounds better in Korean.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.600]   So the whole time she was running from the ghost, it was just a little piece of rice
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.800]   stuck on the, you know, tip of her eyes.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.480]   And she couldn't run from it.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:56.200]   And the reason why she couldn't run from it is because it was on her.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.160]   You can't run from sin.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.020]   You can't legislate sin.
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:07.160]   You can't eradicate sin by standing in the shower and washing longer and using the right
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.120]   soap.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:14.780]   Let me tell you plainly, racism is sin.
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:20.560]   You can't eradicate that by tweaking the system.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:27.600]   Because as long as sinful men are involved, there will always be sin.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:33.260]   You're not going to legislate sin out of anything that human beings do.
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:38.960]   You know, the dilemma of mankind is that God has made us social, so we desire companionship.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.220]   Whether you are an extrovert or an introvert.
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:45.840]   An extrovert may enjoy being around large groups of people, and maybe an introvert wants
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.860]   to be around a small group of people.
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:52.020]   Whether you are an introvert or an extrovert, God made us social.
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:57.060]   And that's why we long to be married, because we want companionship.
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.340]   But you know what's interesting?
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.900]   Now that we've been in isolation for three or four months, people are eager to get out.
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:07.580]   Go out, play basketball, go to the gym, to the beach, and hang out, come to church and
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.020]   fellowship, rub shoulders.
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:14.060]   And then there's a group of people who've never been isolated.
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:19.220]   They're around people, dealing with their bosses all this time, and they are eager to
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:23.260]   get some vacation time, to get away from people.
[00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:26.020]   That's the irony and the dilemma of mankind.
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.460]   God made us social.
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:37.700]   And so we desire to be with people, but then when we are with people, it becomes a problem.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:44.560]   The very thing that we long for becomes the most difficult thing to deal with.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.860]   God made us to be social.
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:49.340]   That's why when Adam was created, he said it's not good for him to be alone, so he created
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.420]   a companion to be with her.
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.620]   But as soon as sin came in, what happened?
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:57.460]   The relationship between husband and wife became contentious.
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:02.460]   And the relationship between husband and wife is representative of all other relationships.
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:06.780]   Whatever mankind is involved in, no matter what party that you are in, no matter what
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:12.220]   legal things that we change, as long as human beings are involved, there will always be
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.460]   sin.
[00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.740]   Because the problem is not with legislation.
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.140]   The problem is not with a system.
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:23.020]   That if we just change the system, if we tweak the system, somehow we can reach perfection.
[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:28.660]   And he says it is absolutely worthless and useless to think that tweaking things are
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:33.000]   going to make things perfect.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:40.740]   That is our human dilemma.
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:45.220]   That's why he says, "The old system is gone.
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:49.060]   Behold, the new has come."
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:56.740]   All the systems of the world are weak and useless because of weak and useless mankind.
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.100]   But the new system, the new priesthood that Jesus brings, on the other hand, is a better
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.900]   system because we have a better priest.
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:09.980]   In Hebrews chapter 7, 22, "So much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:10.980]   covenant."
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:17.220]   Hebrews 7, 21, "For they indeed became priests without an oath, but he with an oath through
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:21.060]   the one who said to him, 'The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind.
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.340]   You are a priest forever.'"
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.780]   You know what anointed means?
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.540]   Anointed means that he was set apart.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:27.780]   He was chosen.
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.540]   He was prepared.
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:34.540]   And that's why in Ephesians chapter 1, it says repeatedly over and over and over again
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.480]   that our salvation was his will.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.740]   It is his purpose.
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:38.740]   It is his election.
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:42.300]   It is the one, he is the one who predestined.
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.960]   He didn't simply tweak the system.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.840]   He anointed Christ to bring in a completely different priesthood.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:54.720]   Ephesians 1, 9, "He made known to us the mystery of his will according to his kindness and
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.920]   intention which he purposed in him."
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:02.560]   Over and over and over again, it's saying Jesus is the anointed one.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.760]   He is the only king priest.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:10.480]   He is the only king of righteousness and the only king of peace.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.400]   That's why in 1 Timothy 2, 5, it says, "For there is one God and one mediator also between
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.280]   God and man, the man Christ Jesus."
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.600]   He's not the best mediator.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.640]   He's the only mediator.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.180]   He's not the best priest.
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:25.280]   He's the only priest.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.320]   I hear some people saying, "You know what?
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.920]   That's what the apostle Paul did.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:33.760]   He venerated Christ and he started sharing all this stuff and Jesus never said that."
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.760]   Of course he said that.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:38.280]   In John 14, 6, Jesus said to him, "I am the way.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.800]   I am the truth and I am the life.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:43.200]   No one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.720]   You know what the key term in that statement is in John 14, 6?
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.660]   The word "the."
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.840]   I am the way.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:51.960]   I am the truth.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.680]   I am the life.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.040]   Not a way, not a truth, not a life, but the.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.120]   The only.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:06.280]   That's what he means when he says he's the only anointed, only purposed, only predestined
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:12.980]   one who is able to perfect sinners to salvation, to bring us to him.
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:16.920]   Not only is he the only one, he's the only eternal one.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:21.040]   Since we have the only one that fits that category, now that we have him, there is no
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.600]   need for another.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.280]   That's what it means when Jesus says it is finished.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.840]   There's nothing more to wait for.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.920]   Now we have Christ, so now let's work on something else.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.560]   He said, "No, if you have Christ, you have everything."
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.920]   Jesus is the answer.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.800]   He's not the beginning of the answer.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:38.800]   He's the answer.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:44.280]   You know, a lot of Christians start with him and think we need to move and mature beyond
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.480]   him.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.560]   And that's the mistake that a lot of Christians get into.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.800]   It's, "Oh, we have Christ.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.760]   Since our salvation is secure and we're no longer going to hell, now let's work on our
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.140]   society.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.260]   Now let's work on poverty.
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:59.320]   Now let's work on politics.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.720]   Now let's work on the family structure."
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:06.000]   When he says, "I am the way, the truth, the life, no one comes to the Father but through
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.280]   me," and when he says it is finished, he's not saying, "I've started the finish.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.680]   I pointed you to the finish."
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.360]   He says, "It is finished."
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:21.040]   Remember what happens when Jesus gives up his breath and he finally physically dies?
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:24.480]   Do you remember the first thing that happens?
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.960]   The curtain is torn.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:27.960]   Remember what the curtain is?
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.120]   The curtain is what separated the holy from the holy of holies.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:36.560]   Meaning our access to God was opened permanently.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.880]   Period.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:43.000]   That our answer is Christ all the time.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.920]   You say, "Well, Christ is the answer to hell."
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.920]   No.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.640]   Christ is the answer to poverty.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.640]   Christ is the answer to loneliness.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.880]   No, Christ is the answer to racism.
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:02.880]   Christ is the answer to war.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.320]   Christ is the answer to politics.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.800]   Christ is the answer to the family.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.480]   Christ is the answer to our economics.
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.040]   Christ is the answer.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:18.600]   Because whatever life that you try to find outside of Christ is just an imitation and
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.920]   it is completely worthless and useless.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:29.160]   Because as long as sinful man is involved, you will never eradicate or legislate sin
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.800]   out of that system.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.280]   Because it's in that person.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:37.240]   It's in the person who is in power and it's in the person who is protesting.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.800]   It is in all of us.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:45.320]   And the answer is only found in Christ.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:50.200]   In Hebrews chapter 7, 16, "Who has become such not on the basis of the law of physical
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:55.600]   requirement but according to the power of an indestructible life."
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:02.240]   Because it's based on an indestructible life, our union with Christ is also indestructible.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:07.420]   And because our union with Christ is indestructible, the life that you and I have received is also
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:08.420]   indestructible.
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:14.480]   It is permanent and it is final.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.200]   And whenever Christians think, "Well, we have Christ now.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.400]   Let's work on something else."
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.080]   You have drifted.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:27.200]   Hebrews 7, 23-25, "The former priests on the one hand existed in a greater numbers
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.480]   because they were prevented by death from continuing.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:35.680]   But Jesus on the other hand, because he continues forever, holds the priesthood permanently.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:41.220]   Therefore, he is able also to save forever, permanently.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:47.240]   Those who draw near to God through him since always, since he always lives to make intercession
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.240]   for them."
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.280]   Always.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:53.180]   Not just until we get to heaven, but for eternity, he will always be interceding on
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.560]   our behalf.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:59.200]   And Hebrews 10, 10, "By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.600]   body of Jesus Christ once for all."
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:11.200]   Let me conclude with this.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:14.760]   Racism.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:21.280]   Right now, I mean, you go online and you put up what, in any position, and you're going
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.360]   to have war breaking out on Facebook.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:30.880]   No matter what you say, because somebody is going to have very militant views on the other
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.600]   end.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:38.320]   One end or the other.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:43.400]   Racism is really at the core of our rebellion.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:48.040]   If you look at the core of our rebellion, it's being self-centered.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.040]   It's me.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.560]   Adam and Eve saw what God had and said, "Oh, I want that.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:52.560]   Let me eat some of that."
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.560]   And I wanted to be like him.
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.680]   Tower of Babel, as soon as they were organized, "Hey, let's build this thing.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:57.680]   I want to be like him."
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.600]   And in Romans chapter one, it says they worship the creation rather than the creator.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.600]   Creation that looked like them.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.600]   So it's self-centeredness.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:07.160]   And that's why Jesus says, "If you want to live," what did he say?
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:10.120]   "To deny yourself, pick up your cross.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.680]   He who finds his life will lose it.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.000]   He who loses his life for my sake will find it."
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.440]   And that's why he says, when he says, "To love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.480]   soul, mind, and strength, love your neighbors," what?
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.480]   As yourself.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:29.840]   He assumed you love yourself because he knows at the core of human rebellion is self-centeredness.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.360]   So you know what happens with self-centered people?
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:37.760]   Self-centered people want to be surrounded by other people who are like me.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:45.560]   Who looks like me, smells like me, you know, does what I do, eats what I eat.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:53.280]   And so racism is basically not being -- not wanting to be around people who are different.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.160]   And it happens both ways.
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:36:01.520]   Typically, we don't call racism when we categorize a different race in a higher light.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.520]   Right?
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.680]   You say, "Wow, Asians are really intelligent.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.680]   How dare you?"
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.520]   I say, "Thank you."
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.520]   Right?
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.840]   Usually racism is we see somebody who's different and we see them lower.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:17.000]   They're not as moral, they're not as intelligent, but when we elevate them, we don't consider
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   that racism.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   It's a compliment.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.760]   Right?
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.320]   Either way, we look at a group of people and we judge them, and so if we think they're
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.960]   higher than us, what happens?
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.240]   We covet it.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.240]   Right?
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.920]   Coveting happens in their hearts.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:35.160]   And when coveting turns negative, you say, "Why?
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.240]   Why do they have something I don't have?"
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.240]   Right?
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.240]   It turns ugly.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:44.960]   So even if it is a good compliment, there's racism in there.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.360]   And then it turns ugly when it's the other way.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.000]   We have a tendency, even within the church -- that's why when the Bible says one of the
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.920]   qualities of an elder is hospitality, hospitality basically means to love strangers, people
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.640]   who are different than you.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.000]   So you can be hospitable with people who are like you all the time in your house.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.680]   That's not what hospitality is.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:12.360]   Hospitality is surrounding yourself and reaching out to people who aren't like you.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.880]   How do we eradicate that?
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.360]   How do we change that?
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:22.120]   Would that change simply because we changed the law?
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.240]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:29.200]   I think we live in a great country, that we have the freedom to be able to protest, that
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:33.400]   we have the freedom to be able to go and vote and say, "I don't want that.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.400]   I don't agree with that."
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.340]   We can change the leaders.
[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:37.340]   We have the freedom to do that.
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:40.720]   And you say, "Well, you know, all democracies have that."
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.440]   On paper, yes.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.120]   Not in reality.
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:48.120]   If you've been around enough countries, you can call it democracy, but the people who
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:52.160]   are in power don't easily let go of it.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.840]   And the rule of law doesn't work.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.760]   You can call it democracy, but it's not actual democracy.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:01.040]   In the United States, it's actual democracy.
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:06.040]   You can say it's not perfect, but it works better than any other country that I've been
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.420]   to.
[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:12.380]   And so if we see injustice, we should speak out.
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:16.320]   If it's wrong, get to the polls and vote them out.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.360]   If something is wrong and we have something that we can do about it, we should do it.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.840]   We should speak out on it.
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:26.960]   But don't be caught up like the rest of the world, thinking that if we tweak the system,
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:30.840]   heaven is going to be brought on earth.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:36.640]   You and I have different values, different set of beliefs, different places where we
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.000]   put hope.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.440]   Tweaking the system isn't going to change.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:45.280]   We have the power to tweak the system, but to believe that if we tweak the system, we're
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.240]   going to eradicate racism is very naive.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:54.320]   In fact, it's unbiblical.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:59.920]   The hardest thing about church, you know, people ask me, "Isn't it hard being a pastor?"
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.760]   I think it's hard being human, no matter what you're doing.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:04.760]   It's hard being a mom.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.240]   It's hard being a dad in this generation.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.120]   Hard being a student.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.760]   Hard being a female.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.660]   Hard being an Asian male.
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:18.480]   Hard being white.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.480]   Hard being Mexican.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.600]   I mean, I think it's just hard being human.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.600]   So people ask, "Isn't it hard being a pastor?"
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:26.360]   I say, "Yeah, there are some parts of it that's hard."
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:30.360]   And people would ask me, "What's the hardest part about being a pastor?"
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:31.360]   People.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.360]   People.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:38.040]   You know, "What's the hardest thing about being an accountant?"
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.040]   People.
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:44.440]   "What's the hardest thing about being a police officer?"
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.440]   People.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:50.360]   "What's the hardest thing about being a, you know, a lawyer?"
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.360]   People.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.720]   That's the hardest.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.040]   Unless you have a job where you don't deal with people at all.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.800]   And then you long for people.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.080]   Right?
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.040]   Which is our human dilemma.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:07.120]   You know, we get together, we sing, but you know, usually all the, most of the dramas
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:11.960]   that are hard and draining is usually deals with people.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:18.720]   But also the greatest part about the church is also the people.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:24.320]   It's when sinners are redeemed and you see people changing.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.960]   You see people loving people that they would not normally love.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.320]   Doing things that we wouldn't normally do.
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.440]   And we start to reflect Christ in our lives.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:38.040]   So the hardest part about the church is the people, but also the best part about the church
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:41.520]   is also the people.
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:46.080]   The difference is what's going on in here.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.640]   This difference is what's going on in here.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:51.560]   And let me give you a practical example.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:57.920]   How God deals with racism.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:03.120]   When you're a kid, you know, when you're a kid and you get a present, I'm talking about
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.120]   a really young kid, right?
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:11.000]   And what's the latest, I'm trying to make this illustration relevant.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.440]   Let's say, okay, you get an Xbox.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.560]   Did I miss the mark?
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.040]   Is Xbox the big thing?
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.040]   Switch.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.720]   Okay, let's use Switch, okay?
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:23.040]   Let's say you're a little kid.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.960]   You're not old enough to really appreciate the Switch, okay?
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.880]   So you're like two years old.
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.280]   So those of you who have kids, you know what I mean.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:37.400]   You get them this gift and you put it in a nice box and they don't know what it is, so
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.880]   what do they end up doing?
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.560]   They play with the box.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:42.560]   They play with the box.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.320]   You spend all that money and you save it to give it to them and then they're climbing
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:49.040]   inside the box, outside the box.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.600]   They're putting, you know, little holes in the box.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:57.920]   And imagine they're starting comparing, saying, "Hey, how come he has a red box?
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.640]   And he has a blue box and they have a polka dot box and they're all comparing the boxes."
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:07.940]   It's like, wait a second, that's not even the gift.
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:10.040]   The gift is the Switch.
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:17.680]   But after a while, you get a little bit older and you understand what the gift is and what
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:22.880]   makes that gift really valuable is not the package but what's inside.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:31.240]   And so it could be a yellow box, it could be a paper box, it could be trash.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:34.920]   But once you open it, it's a Switch.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.680]   So all of a sudden, it doesn't matter the package.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:44.640]   It doesn't matter what package it came in because the gift is the Switch.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:49.240]   And only a child would be comparing the package.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:58.840]   See, if we try to eradicate racism by changing our mindset, ourselves, it doesn't happen.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:04.600]   You get justice for one person which creates injustice for another person.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:10.680]   But what is attractive about an individual is not the package.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:16.160]   It's the Christ in that person.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:24.800]   So you can be a 13-year-old child in Africa who loves Christ and I have more I can relate
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:30.520]   to that person than middle-aged Korean American who immigrated here, who has older brother,
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:36.400]   younger brother, grew up in a Christian home and speaks Korean and English.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:42.720]   I have more in common with that 13-year-old in Kenya than I do with this man because I
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:47.520]   know the Christ that she has in her.
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.200]   I don't want to be around people like me.
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:54.160]   I'm trying really hard to get rid of some of this stuff.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.000]   I'm trying to shed the package that I'm in.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.600]   I'm waiting eagerly for the redemption of this body so that I can be with the Lord and
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.080]   be with him forever.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:11.200]   And so my paradigm completely shifted when I met Christ.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:16.960]   All that I longed for in this world became rubbish in the light of Christ.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:23.800]   So now the people who are the most attracted to me are not the package that it comes in,
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:27.640]   but the Christ in that person.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:32.400]   And that's what he means when he's taken the Jews and the Gentiles who had hostility toward
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.400]   one another.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.000]   He didn't all of a sudden change the law and the system and tweaked it and had seminars
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.540]   with one another.
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:42.880]   They were radically transformed inwardly.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:48.800]   And so what happens to a Christian when he meets Christ is what is beautiful changes
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:53.000]   radically.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.080]   That's how peace with God establishes peace with man.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:04.240]   So it is dangerous for Christians to be caught up in the tidal wave that is coming upon our
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:10.320]   generation to think that if we can just change the package that we would somehow learn to
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.080]   love one another.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:19.960]   This is why we preach the gospel, because we believe there's only one anointed high priest
[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:26.200]   who intercedes for us and who has the power to bring perfection.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:34.320]   So my challenge and encouragement to all of us, be careful when the tidal waves come.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.880]   Watch carefully.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:37.880]   Examine everything.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:40.240]   Test everything.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:45.280]   And make sure, is this coming from Christ or is this coming from the world?
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:51.440]   Like I said in the beginning, if there's any time in my lifetime where we need to be absolutely
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.760]   anchored in Christ, it is today.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.880]   Let's be anchored in Christ.
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:05.200]   Let's be a light in this dark world that what they are really screaming for is for Christ.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.360]   Let's stand in that gap and intercede on their behalf.
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.360]   Let's pray.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:22.600]   Heavenly Father, we pray to you.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:29.200]   And we know we're always desperate, but even now, Father God, especially now, be merciful
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.600]   to us.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.680]   Be merciful, Lord God, to our families.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:39.240]   Be merciful to our generation, to churches, to pastors, to Christians.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:46.360]   Help us, Lord God, to fix our eyes upon Christ, author and the perfecter of our faith.
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:54.240]   I pray that as the world becomes darker, that our love for you would become stronger.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:58.400]   Lord God, bring revival.
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:04.760]   That at the end of all of this, that we would have redeemed a time to proclaim Christ and
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:05.760]   him crucified.
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.760]   In Jesus' name we pray.
