[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   All right, this segment is on Ukraine and we've, we're calling it the Ukraine debate
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.040]   because we have two great writers and thinkers up here who are on slightly different sides
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.520]   of this issue of the US involvement in Ukraine.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.720]   Antonio Garcia Martinez writes, is the author of the bestselling book, Chaos Monkeys, about
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.880]   Silicon Valley.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.520]   He writes a sub stack called Pull Request and also has a great call-in show.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.800]   And Glenn Greenwald is, Glenn Greenwald is back with us from yesterday.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.560]   Also a phenomenal writer, has an amazing sub stack all of you guys should check out as
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.840]   well and a great call-in show.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.240]   So in setting up this topic, let me just say, I think, you know, that, you know, in thinking
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.760]   about the US involvement in Ukraine, you know, there's not a lot of debate about this topic.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.000]   And in that sense, it's pretty similar to other wars that the US has gotten into.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.760]   Many of you probably are not old enough to remember when the US got into Iraq or Afghanistan.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.880]   And I'm not old enough to remember the US getting into Vietnam.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.840]   But the thing to understand about all those wars is that they were incredibly popular
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.880]   at the time that we entered them.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.400]   And by the time that they ended, they were not.
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.720]   And now I'm not saying, I'm not prejudging Ukraine and saying it's one of those.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.720]   I think there's important differences that we should get into.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.520]   But I think we should at least have this debate and we need more discussion around this.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:49.600]   And so for that, I'm grateful that Antonio is going to participate.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.000]   So what I'm going to do is kick it to each of them for kind of five minute opening statements.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.080]   And then we'll just get into sort of more of a back and forth.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.080]   And we'll start with Antonio.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.080]   Cool.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.080]   Thanks.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.080]   Thanks, David.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.800]   Thanks for skewing the moderation from like, literally the first second, comparing it to
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.760]   Iraq, because I came up here to say it's not about Iraq at all.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.240]   But yeah, so let's just start off with I think, probably most people here know that I actually
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.160]   spent some time in Ukraine.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.880]   Unlike a lot of the independent voices who decided to opine from afar about Ukraine,
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.920]   I felt that the American media discourse about Ukraine was completely skewed.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.160]   And it just smelled kind of bullshitty to me.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.240]   And so I thought I had to go and actually see it.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.840]   And so I spent some time on the Polish border with Ukraine.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.800]   This was kind of in the earliest part of the war, kind of early March.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.320]   And the western part of Ukraine, which by the way, is not particularly dangerous or
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.320]   anything.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.880]   It's probably no more dangerous than walking across San Francisco these days, to be honest.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.080]   But it was interesting to actually go and see.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.080]   And I took away two things.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.340]   I wrote two subsect posts about it that I want to share with you.
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.600]   Two parts of the Ukraine story.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.520]   One, the refugee situation is incredible.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.520]   It is something that you have to see to believe.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.200]   And even then, you can't quite understand the scope of it.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.240]   Ten million Ukrainians, a quarter of the country is currently displaced.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.080]   Something like six million Ukrainians have left in the span of two months.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.440]   When you stand at the border at Medica, which is one of the border crossings with Poland,
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.080]   what you see is you're at it and you realize you're at the fringes of sort of normal, you
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.320]   know, western European life.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.740]   And you've entered, on the other side of that is hell that people are escaping.
[00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.740]   And what do you see?
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.440]   You see, again, the men can't leave because they're prohibited from leaving because they
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.440]   have to fight.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.280]   And so what you see is old people or women with children.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.400]   Imagine a woman in her 30s with two kids, a little rolly bag, and like a cat in a bag.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.660]   Like that's the typical thing.
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.720]   And just a line of them going over the border again and again and again.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.620]   And the Poles have been amazing in how they receive the Ukrainians, literally millions
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.620]   of Ukrainians.
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.880]   But all the same, it's an enormous strain.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.320]   Everywhere you go in eastern Poland or western Ukraine, that's a big open area, is basically
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.560]   a refugee camp, whether it be a train station, repurposed warehouses, all of it.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.440]   The human situation is just kind of mind boggling.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.200]   The other thing I'd like to share, I crossed the border.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.720]   It was weird crossing the border.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.640]   There's this line of people looking to leave.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.400]   And there's like you with my little Starlink and my little bag and my little body armor
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.800]   like walking across the other way.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.340]   Because you can't take cars across.
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.440]   Everyone walks across.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.560]   And everyone's looking at me like I'm crazy, right?
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.280]   Because why are you walking in the other direction, bro?
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.360]   And so anyway, I walked in the other direction, had a driver pick me up, experienced a little
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.000]   bit of western Ukraine for a few days.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.040]   And I experienced what I think probably nobody here has experienced directly, which is total
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.040]   war, right?
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.760]   A society that's completely and totally mobilized to repel a foreign invader, right?
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.720]   I was in a city called Lviv, which is one of the western cities that sort of free Ukraine.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.720]   And everything there is either men and weapons and trucks going east or women and children
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.880]   and refugees going west.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.880]   That's all you would see.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.440]   That's all that would happen there.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.640]   And all of society from the interpreter I had, because unfortunately I speak no Ukrainian,
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.040]   to the driver who would drive me around, to the hacker I interviewed who was like DDoSing
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.540]   Russian websites, all of them would punctuate their statements with "We will win," right?
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.380]   And that's when I realized that the big mistake that everyone had made, I think particularly
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.880]   in the U.S. discourse, is underrating Ukrainian resolve and their zeal for their own nationalist
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.960]   project, right?
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.800]   After spending a day there, and again, remember, this is the relatively early days of the war.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.960]   Kharkiv is still encircled.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.800]   It wasn't clear if the Belarusians would start a western front.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   It was all still up in the air.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.520]   But I was starting to think, you know, I don't see how the Russians win this.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.400]   Like this just seems impossible.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.120]   Ukraine is the size of Texas, has a population of 40 million people, roughly the size—imagine
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.640]   the Russians showing up with 200,000 soldiers and trying to control California.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.120]   It's going to be very difficult to do, particularly when literally everybody is staring at you
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.360]   and saying, "We will win," which is what happened.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.160]   And that's when I realized that this whole story was very different than it's being projected
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.160]   in the United States.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.680]   And that's—I felt vindicated in going, because I think there aren't that many American
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.560]   journalists there, and I think a lot of the discourse in the U.S. tends to skew towards
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.440]   Iraq or towards projection of American political domestic neuroses and not the facts on the
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.940]   ground in Ukraine, in which you have devastated cities, you have women and children refugees,
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.600]   you have literally a total war situation that the western world hasn't seen since World
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.600]   War II.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.200]   That's the reality of Ukraine and what I hope to debate here.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   All right.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   Thank you.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   Glenn.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.200]   Great.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.320]   I think with all due respect for anyone's decision to go actually see a place that you
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.000]   want to talk about, I think that there is, though, a question of how much you can actually
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.840]   learn about a country of 44 million people with an incredibly complex history, with extreme
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.720]   diversity of thought in terms of the population by going for whatever it is, a week or 10
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.600]   days, to a kind of sliver of that country that has extremely different views than another
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.600]   region.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.800]   For example, if in 2003 you wanted to go before the war in Iraq and figure out what Iraqis
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.720]   thought, if you went to the Kurdish regions of Iraq, you would hear nothing but, "I want
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.440]   the United States to come and liberate us from Saddam Hussein."
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.640]   If you went to the Sunni triangle, you would hear, "If the United States comes here, we're
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.480]   going to make this a graveyard of Americans."
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.000]   And similarly, if you go to western Ukraine, of course you're going to hear, "We want American
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   help.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   We want to fight the Russians to the end."
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.880]   If you go to the eastern regions of Ukraine, which are Russian-speaking, who identify with
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.040]   Moscow, you're going to hear the exact opposite.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.360]   So I think it's commendable to go to a country like Ukraine.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:09.840]   I think we have to be humble about our ability to understand the thoughts of the population,
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.400]   the reality on the ground, when you go to certain segments that you select and that
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.960]   are almost likely to kind of feed back to you what it is that you're already expecting
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.960]   to hear.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:27.240]   The other thing I think is very important to note is that, first of all, I'm a little
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:33.000]   surprised by the idea that, I guess it was implicit that Antonio felt that the media
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.600]   narrative has been off or one-sided in the sense that it hasn't been favorable enough
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.560]   to the idea that Ukraine is the victim that needs help and Russia is the clear aggressor.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.760]   I can't remember ever reading an article in the mainstream press since the invasion that
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:56.260]   said anything other than that, which is why 80% of Americans, the entire bipartisan class
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:02.040]   in Washington of both parties, are essentially unified in support of the narrative that Antonio
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.960]   believes in my opinion with great sincerity.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.760]   I think there's been, if anything, a kind of lack of dissent available in the United
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.200]   States on the other side.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.920]   And this is one thing I want to emphasize is there has been this claim, this sort of
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.360]   implicit claim, sometimes explicit claim, that the entire war is united behind the United
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.080]   States, behind Ukraine, against Russia.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:31.560]   The reality is, overwhelmingly, most of the world is, in fact, not united behind the United
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.680]   States and then in opposition on Ukraine.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:40.560]   Most of the global South, 15 of the 20 most populous countries on the planet either abstained
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:46.820]   or voted no when it came time to decide whether to expel Russia from the Human Rights Council.
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.800]   And some of those countries are tyrannies, many of them, such as India, the world's largest
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:58.120]   democracy, Brazil, the second largest democracy after the United States, very much deviates
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.900]   from the consensus in the United States.
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:06.240]   And sometimes I think if we're Americans and we're living in a country in which we're bombarded
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.800]   with one message, it's incumbent upon us to ask why it is that so much of the rest of
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.680]   the world does not believe that the United States is participating in the war in Ukraine
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:21.560]   with benevolent intentions or with the desire to protect democracy or protect against aggression.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.800]   When, in fact, the rest of the world looks at the history of the United States, not just
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.480]   distant but very recent, and sees a country not devoted to protecting democracy but to
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:36.680]   propping up tyranny, to fighting wars not to protect innocence but to sacrifice innocence
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.840]   in its own interests.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.800]   And so I think that's one really important thing is to make sure that we're looking at
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.800]   this war not as a country that's essentially a belligerent in it but as a country that
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.960]   is just a small part of the rest of the world that has a lot of opinions.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:10:00.200]   The other thing I would point out is war in general is the worst thing that humanity can
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.460]   unleash upon itself.
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:06.880]   There is no war that doesn't involve extreme amounts of atrocities, extreme amounts of
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.760]   war crimes, all kinds of hideous things.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:16.920]   And if you look at any war, any war, not just the ones that the United States adversaries
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.040]   have started but ones that the United States has started, ones that the United States'
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.680]   allies have started, that we support, you're going to find enormous amounts of atrocities.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:32.160]   And any decent person with any kind of a minimum moral compass who looks at any war like that
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.480]   is going to walk away horrified and disgusted and wanting to do something about it.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:42.320]   The only difference between what's happening in the war in Ukraine and so many other wars
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:50.120]   is that the U.S. media is constantly showing us images and stories about Ukrainian victims,
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.680]   as it should.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.040]   But think about the wars that the United States has itself started or is propping up, like
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.320]   for example the war in Yemen that has been going on for many years, that is still going
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.280]   on because the United States is supplying Saudi Arabia, not exactly a democracy with
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.760]   enormous amounts of weapons and money and intelligence to fight that war.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:16.640]   And think about how much you've heard or seen about the victims of Yemen.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:22.640]   How many Yemenis have you heard from talking about their relatives who have been lost in
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:28.080]   battle or how many people who we bombed in wedding parties and the like have been lost
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.080]   as well.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.960]   And so I think what this can happen is it can create an imbalance in our perception.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.320]   The imbalance isn't that the war in Ukraine really isn't horrible, it is, but that there's
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.040]   really nothing extraordinary about what's taking place in that war.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.200]   All wars, including the ones we start, the ones that we're waging, the ones that we're
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.200]   supporting have the same kinds of atrocities and the question ultimately becomes does the
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:55.960]   United States really have benevolent motives in trying to defend Ukraine instead of sacrifice
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.960]   it?
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.040]   And secondly, does the United States have the ability to foster a positive outcome on
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:06.720]   the other side of the world involving extremely complex cultures and histories and two countries
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:11.880]   of very intertwined geostrategic interests that even if we did have the right motives,
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.160]   would we really have the ability by flooding this country with weapons and all the other
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.120]   things we typically do in wars to foster a positive outcome?
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.560]   And I think that's why the rest of the world has a lot of doubts.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.120]   Okay, thank you, Glenn.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.320]   So Glenn went on a little longer.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.040]   So Antonio, why don't I give you a couple of minutes to respond to that and then I want
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.320]   to ask you both a question.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.960]   Okay, I think I walked into the wrong thing.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.080]   I didn't realize we were debating Yemen instead of Ukraine, Glenn.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.680]   Or Indian foreign policy instead of our own.
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.840]   One thing I would say is, one thing you said is just completely wrong.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.220]   It's not the case that Eastern Ukraine is pro-Russian.
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.400]   If so, how do you explain Mariupol, a city completely destroyed that fought to the last
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.920]   man with civilians literally holing up in a steel plant, how do you explain all the
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.400]   successes in the eastern part of the war?
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.160]   You never actually mention the facts of the war.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.940]   You're always what abouting other countries' reaction to the war.
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.200]   The fact that the eastern front in Russia, the war is going very poorly for Russia.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.440]   How do you explain that fact that if Eastern Ukraine is actually pro-Russian, that the
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.920]   Russians are doing so poorly there?
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.720]   The other thing I would say, I don't think it's the fact, if you look at most polls,
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.280]   and it's funny, this poll came out and instantly your friend Tucker Carlson as well as J.D.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.920]   Vance had to change their line on Ukraine because they realized that it's hard to be
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.960]   a populist if your views aren't very popular.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.680]   AP did a poll.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:21.120]   Not just Democrats support Biden being tougher on Russian, Republicans do as well.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.120]   Why is that?
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.680]   Because you have a small country that's getting crushed by a country that's been the historical
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.640]   sworn enemy of the United States as long as anyone can remember.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.520]   I live out in the middle of nowhere in a red state Trump country in the desert outside
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.760]   of Reno and people are flying Ukrainian flags along with the US flags.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.520]   I don't think that's because they read the New York Times.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.520]   The other thing...
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:46.040]   Antonio, let me ask a question.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.080]   We recently had, well previously Biden came out...
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.320]   Can I just address one last thing there?
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.080]   He went through several points there.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.560]   The other thing I would say is that this and that country don't support it.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.320]   One thing I found, one aspect of the story that I found was very interesting was that
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.680]   all of Europe has shown up on Ukraine's door to help out the Ukrainians.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.760]   Usually I'm both EU/US citizen, usually I read both media.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.440]   It's like the US that is like the hard line, royal politik, and then the EU that's in geopolitical
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.440]   la la land.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.640]   I think in the case of this story it's been reversed.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.280]   And I think the US is taking Ukraine and projecting it in its own domestic political narratives
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.280]   like Venice.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.480]   And I think the Europeans actually see their own collective history in the Ukrainian story.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.040]   Because whether it be the Spanish Civil War, whether it be the Germans, they all remember
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.800]   what total war actually means.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.720]   What it is to stumble through destroyed streets and be a refugee and a displaced person.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.000]   Americans don't have an experience of that.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.640]   They can't really resonate with that.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.240]   Fortunately for us, to be clear, but I think Europeans do.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.400]   So if you go to that border area, you will see all of Europe, as far away as Spain, Denmark,
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.640]   whatever, showing up to actually help the Ukrainians.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.680]   The last thing I would say is, I think one thing that unites, I think, the old left that
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:55.120]   you would probably put yourself in with, Glenn, like a Bernie leftist, and the new right,
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.760]   is that both consider two key things.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.440]   One, the US can never act abroad in a legitimate good way.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.520]   Everything the US does abroad is always a fiasco.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.040]   And then two, everything that happens abroad is our fault.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.440]   Like literally, the entire world's events are downstream of a State Department phone
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.440]   call.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.760]   And I just don't think that's true.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.640]   Being in Ukraine, it doesn't seem to me as if the US is pulling all the strings.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.280]   On the contrary, it seems like a very chaotic situation where the Ukrainians are trying
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.560]   to improvise as much as they can.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.480]   And so again, on the one hand, I reject the fact that the US can't act abroad.
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.480]   Well, I think it can.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.520]   If you look at things, East Asia, Japan, Korea, Western Europe itself, the US has created
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.920]   the conditions for democracy in the past.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.160]   Okay, but Antonio, is there a limit to wise US involvement in Ukraine?
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:39.900]   So we had Biden basically said that Putin cannot remain in power, and then immediately
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.320]   his own press secretary walked that back as a gaffe.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:48.440]   You then had Secretary of Defense Austin say that our objective in Ukraine is not just
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.760]   to expel the Russians, but to weaken Russia as a great power so it can never threaten
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.880]   anyone again.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:58.360]   You then had Seth Moulton, the Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, saying
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.160]   that we were in a proxy war with Russia.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.200]   And then Steny Hoyer, the House Majority Leader, said we are at war with Russia.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.240]   Do you think we are at war with Russia, and is that wise?
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.240]   No, we're in a proxy war.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.160]   We're in a proxy war with Russia.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.400]   What is the vital national interest of the United States that compels us to be in a war,
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.540]   admittedly through a proxy, with Russia that has 6,000 nuclear weapons?
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:24.760]   Even if I were to grant that we should be trying to, out of humanitarian motives, expel
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:29.900]   the Russians from Ukraine, do you believe that we should be trying to destabilize and
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.760]   topple Putin?
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.760]   Let me come to that with a question.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.760]   It's funny.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.460]   I feel like I'm debating two people, but I joked in my tweet, the odds are even worse
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.660]   for the Ukrainians, so I'll take it.
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:43.680]   But I'm going to ask you this question in Miami not too long ago, David.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.060]   You're the one who said, oh, we're threatening World War III.
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.860]   We're engaging in nuclear brinkmanship.
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.220]   By the way, things that we did all throughout the Cold War.
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.300]   I was raised as an '80s kid here in Miami.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.540]   We used to do this thing all the time.
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.540]   At what point would you stop?
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.180]   At what point do you think it's actually worth rolling the dice?
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:01.220]   At what point between Lviv and Warsaw and your front door would you stop and say, actually,
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.740]   World War III and nuclear war is worth risking?
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.820]   Because that's an answer I don't get out of the appeasers.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.420]   At what point do you actually put your foot down?
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:12.060]   Well, I mean, look, what I've said is that I'm willing to arm Ukraine under Cold War
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:16.420]   rules, i.e. the way that we armed the Mujahideen in Afghanistan.
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:21.260]   So we provided them with stingers, but it wasn't a US flag on the box, and it wasn't
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.760]   US flags on the trucks.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.500]   There were a certain set of rules by which we engaged in to avoid the risk of World War
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.500]   III with the Russians.
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.980]   Do you feel that's not the case now?
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:35.420]   I think it's-- no, because we have now defined our objectives in a much more expansive way.
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.700]   And I'll let Glenn speak for himself, because I think he would not go as far as me.
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.780]   I'm sort of in-- I'm willing to do a little bit more.
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:43.780]   But no.
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:49.060]   You have the President of the United States saying that he wants to basically topple
[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.060]   Putin.
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:53.260]   You've got Austin saying that our objectives here go beyond Ukraine.
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.540]   It's basically to kick Russia out of the League of Great Powers.
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:00.460]   And moreover, you've got the State Department declaring that we're in a global struggle
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.860]   between autocracy and democracy.
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.340]   So we've defined the struggle in Manichaean terms.
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.420]   And if somehow Ukraine were to lose, there's a domino theory where dictators are going
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.640]   to take over the whole globe.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.260]   And so I think we've invested--
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.260]   I would give them some help.
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:22.460]   But I would not allow the-- no American president has ever claimed that the United States has
[00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.260]   a vital national interest in Ukraine.
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.740]   Name the president who's done it before maybe--
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.140]   In fact, can I just make a point about that?
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:33.380]   So first of all, at the start of every war that we fought over the last 60 years, the
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.500]   same climate, if we were in the United States, would prevail as the one that's in this room.
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.340]   Every time some comment was made that the United States is on the right side, we're
[00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.540]   actually doing the right thing.
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.020]   We're fighting on behalf--
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.900]   Everybody in the auditorium would, woo, applaud.
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:45.980]   It's really good.
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:50.980]   It's a good feeling to feel like your country, your government is doing something deeply
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:51.980]   moral.
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:57.580]   So again, I just want to show-- and maybe this doesn't matter because you think that
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:03.620]   most other countries are primitive or arrogant or immersed in propaganda.
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.480]   And we're not.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.220]   But here are the top 20 countries by population.
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:14.300]   And the ones in yellow are the ones who refuse to support the UN resolution expelling Russia
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.820]   from the UN Human Rights Council.
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:21.420]   And you can see that it's nine out of the 10 most populous countries that are on the
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.160]   opposite side of all the cheering that's taking place in this auditorium.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:30.860]   This is exactly what has repeated itself every time we've gone to war-- in Vietnam, in Iraq,
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.100]   in Afghanistan, in Libya, in Syria.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:39.460]   All Americans across the board, 80%, 85%, are on board with the war in the beginning
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:44.860]   because it feels so good to believe your country is going to war to do something positive.
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:49.420]   And then six months later or a year later or five years later, every single one of those
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.260]   wars, overwhelming majority say it was a huge mistake.
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:58.900]   That at least to me would cause some humility to ask, why does that pattern keep repeating
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.060]   itself?
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:05.420]   Why am I as an American always so susceptible to cheering my government's involvement in
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:11.340]   a war when the rest of the world is telling you that actually you're being propagandized,
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:15.940]   that the motive the United States government is claiming to have, which is defending democracy,
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:21.240]   is not actually their motive, as illustrated by-- I don't know why the rule is we're not
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.780]   allowed to evaluate other things the United States is doing to determine whether those
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.820]   motives are real, like what we do in Saudi Arabia or what we do in Yemen.
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.500]   It seems like if someone comes to you and claims that they're acting with a certain
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:37.460]   motive to determine whether that's really the motive, you'd want to look at the history
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.420]   of that person and whether their behavior is consistent with that motive.
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:47.380]   That's what the rest of the world is doing and the reason why they find these propagandistic
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:52.420]   claims of the United States so preposterous because so many of them have been victimized
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:57.580]   by the United States overthrowing their democratically elected governments, not in the distant past,
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.220]   but in the recent ones.
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.740]   Here's the next 10 most populous countries.
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.580]   Six out of 10 also deviates from the US position.
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.980]   As far as what David was saying, this was Barack Obama.
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:16.420]   It's not what Antonio was saying, people on the far left, my friend Tucker Carlson, evil
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.480]   far right people.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:21.840]   This is Barack Obama in 2016 on his way out the door.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:26.200]   He was confronted in a very lengthy interview by Jeffrey Goldberg, the neoconservative editor
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.860]   in chief of the Atlantic, who probably did more than anybody else to convince Americans
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:36.660]   to support the war in Iraq in 2002 and three by claiming that Al Qaeda was in an alliance
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.660]   with Saddam Hussein.
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:44.380]   He was demanding to know why Obama spent his presidency refusing to arm the Ukrainians
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.060]   and refusing to confront Moscow.
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:51.300]   Here's what Jeffrey Goldberg in 2016 quoted Obama as saying.
[00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.220]   This is Goldberg's quote for Obama.
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.620]   "Obama's theory here is simple.
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:02.500]   Ukraine is a core Russian interest, but not an American one.
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:06.900]   Russia will always be able to maintain escalatory dominance there."
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.660]   The fact is that Ukraine, which is a non-NATO country, is going to be vulnerable to military
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.800]   domination by Russia no matter what we do.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.080]   It's realistic, but this is an example of where we have to be very clear about what
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.500]   our core interests are and what we are willing to go to war for.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:30.940]   Here is the current CIA director, William Burns, who's also not on the far left or part
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:36.060]   of the far right, who in 2008 in a memo to Condoleezza Rice when the Bush administration
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:41.780]   wanted to expand NATO up to Russian borders, warned, this is what he wrote, "Ukrainian
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:47.420]   entry into NATO is the brightest of all red lines for the Russian elite, not just Putin.
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:52.060]   In more than two and a half years of conversations with key Russian players, from knuckle-draggers
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:57.740]   in the dark recesses of the Kremlin to Putin's sharpest liberal critics, I have yet to find
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:03.620]   anyone who views Ukraine and NATO as anything other than a direct challenge to Russian interests."
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:08.420]   This has been conventional wisdom in Washington up until February 24th when it suddenly became
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.300]   taboo to talk about.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:16.500]   Russia views Ukraine as the most vital interest to it because it was twice used by Germany
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:22.040]   to invade Russia in the 20th century and virtually destroy it, and that Ukraine never has been
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.420]   and never will be a vital interest to the United States.
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.100]   Okay, Glenn, let's go to Antonio.
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.100]   Let's give him a chance.
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.180]   Okay, Glenn, I think that argument sounded better in the original Russian, to be honest.
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.140]   I mean, I don't know why you're sitting here citing six-year-old Atlantic pieces about
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.140]   Obama.
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.860]   Are you going to address the reality of what we're talking about?
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.500]   In that list of nations, by the way, you included such human rights luminaries as Iran and China
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.620]   as having voted against it.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:43.980]   Let me ask you a direct question.
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:48.300]   Should Russia be sitting on the UN Human Rights Council, a country that routinely incarcerates
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.500]   journalists and has a heinous human rights record?
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:55.500]   I mean, if you look at who else is on the Human Rights Council, like the United States,
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.500]   a country that still has Guantanamo— You're always whatabouting, Glenn.
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.500]   Just answer the question.
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:02.760]   No, it's not whataboutism to say you have to look at what the rest of the world is doing
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.980]   in order to understand the moral framework.
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:09.580]   Why is it that the United States, that still has people on Guantanamo for 20 years with
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:14.960]   no trial, that destroyed the country of Iraq, a country of 25 million people that created
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.700]   the worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen, that is imprisoning journalists like Julian Assange
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:26.060]   with no charges for over a decade now, has any moral credibility to say we are morally
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.060]   superior?
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:31.060]   I know it feels good to say that, but the reality is the United States, if you look
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:35.620]   at what it's actually doing, which is going around the world and has always done this,
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:40.500]   supporting tyranny, not supporting democracy, propping up despots, not fighting them, if
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:46.300]   you want to believe that there's a way to go into Ukraine and defend the Ukrainians
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:50.620]   and all of that, I believe that that's what you want to do, but it would be incredibly
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:55.620]   naive to refuse to ask ourselves whether that's really the goal of the United States, given
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.660]   everything we know about the government.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:01.200]   And if the goal of the United States is not the benevolent one that you hope they have
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:07.680]   and that you have, but instead is a different one, namely not to defend Ukraine and Ukrainians,
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:12.780]   but to sacrifice Ukraine in pursuit of this broader geopolitical goal that David mentioned
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:17.180]   that they're now admitting, which is to weaken Russia and bring about regime change,
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.620]   then you're cheering for a war that is completely different than the war that is actually being
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:22.620]   fought.
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:23.620]   No, I disagree.
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.620]   I think you've spent too long in Plato's cave of Twitter and you don't stare at reality
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:27.620]   anymore, to be quite honest.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.620]   None of what I showed you came from Twitter.
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.620]   Excuse me.
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:30.620]   None of what I just showed you came from Twitter.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.860]   Yeah, it came from the six-year-old Atlantic piece.
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.140]   It's even less relevant.
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:38.460]   Just this week, the Finnish and Swedish parliaments voted to join NATO.
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:40.140]   Why is that?
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:42.380]   Your argument is completely backwards.
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.380]   Russia's not aggressive.
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.380]   Hold on a second.
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:45.380]   Let me finish the thought.
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:46.380]   No, hold on.
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:50.020]   Russia's ... Let me respond to the point that you sat there for two minutes staring at.
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:51.940]   Russia's not surrounded by NATO.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.780]   Russia isn't aggressive because it's surrounded by NATO.
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.460]   It's surrounded by NATO because it's aggressive.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.860]   Countries like Finland and Sweden have been living under the Russian boot, and Finland,
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.540]   most of all, knows it from the Winter War, and that threat has been there constantly.
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.460]   Again, what do you know that the Finnish and Swedish parliaments, who are trying to make
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.580]   a decision for their people, don't know?
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:15.500]   If I were a country and I had the option to have the richest and most powerful country
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:20.380]   with the biggest military, tell me that if anyone invades you, I'm going to go into war
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.380]   and fight against you.
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.940]   I would say, "Yeah, I would love that also.
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:24.500]   That sounds like a really great thing."
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:28.180]   Of course, every country would love to have a pledge from the world's greatest military
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.100]   that if anyone attacks you ... Are you seriously saying that countries would
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.740]   line up to be Ukraine?
[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:38.980]   What do you know about the United States intentions that all of the countries I just showed you,
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.540]   not including tyrannies, many of which are on the United States side, but many democracies
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:47.620]   who have had their democracies subverted by the United States, who are saying, "We do
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:51.560]   not believe the United States is well-intentioned, that every time the United States involves
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:56.940]   itself in a war, it convinces its own citizens that it's going to do benevolent things, but
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.020]   the reality is exactly the opposite."
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.820]   What do you know that the entire rest of the world doesn't?
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:02.820]   It's not the entire rest of the world.
[00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:03.820]   It's a huge part of it.
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.460]   The Europeans who are close to the conflict completely disagree with you.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.500]   The Danes, the cuddly little Danes are saying lethal aid to Ukraine.
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.500]   My own country, the Spanish are.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.500]   The US and Europeans are on your side.
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.500]   Let me shift gears.
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.500]   I want to get to another aspect of this topic.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:18.340]   Let's start with you, Antonio.
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:22.740]   What is the outcome that you would like to see here?
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:31.700]   Right now, the way that victory is being defined by Ukraine and by our State Department is
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:38.820]   that we kick Russia out of Ukraine, maybe even Crimea too, that's the official policy,
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:45.620]   and maybe we destabilize and topple Putin.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.820]   What's the outcome that you think our objective should be here?
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:54.540]   My ideal outcome is whatever the Ukrainians want for themselves, which seems to be, if
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:59.660]   you listen to them, seems to be a liberal democratic Ukraine that wants to join the
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.140]   greater EU Western sphere.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:06.220]   If you look at the Maidan protests in 2015, this is when everyone kind of revolted against
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.100]   the pro-Russian leader at the time, and there were civilian shootings.
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.900]   And if you talk to Ukrainians, I mean, there's been 200 years or longer of Ukrainian sort
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:17.620]   of nationalism kind of brewing, but the 2014, 2015 protests were really a formative period
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.660]   where the Ukrainians really said, "This is it.
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.660]   We've got our own country."
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.900]   And if you talk to them, they're like, "We've had seven years of democracy.
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.660]   We're not giving it up now."
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:28.340]   And if you look at things like the mass graves discovered at Buko, when the Russians pulled
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:31.540]   back, they look at that and they say, "If we fail, that's the future that awaits us."
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:32.540]   Right?
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:33.540]   So they want the opposite of that.
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:38.740]   Apparently, 80 to 90 percent of the population in Crimea is Russian and wants to be part
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:39.740]   of Russia.
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.140]   Does that go back to Ukraine or does that go to Russia?
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.260]   It's a good question.
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:48.980]   But the Ukrainians under Zelensky believe that Crimea belongs to them.
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:51.220]   So is he wrong about that?
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:54.900]   Doesn't the principle of self-determination mean that those peoples should get to decide
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.020]   which country they go with?
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.860]   I mean, that's as much a question for Crimea as it is Catalonia and Spain.
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.380]   I mean, you're asking me to speak for Zelensky.
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:07.520]   But the Russians have a naval base at Sevastopol that gives them control over the Black Sea.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:13.260]   And if you tell them that what Ukrainian victory means here is they get kicked out of that
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:19.060]   naval base and lose control of the Black Sea, you have threatened them existentially.
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:24.140]   And you know their policy with regard to nuclear weapons is it's allowed if their nation is
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.180]   existentially threatened.
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.580]   So we are playing with fire here.
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:31.360]   Is that an objective that we are willing to risk a nuclear war for?
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.340]   As we did in Cuba with nuclear weapons there.
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.660]   I don't think we should be.
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:39.880]   So we need to define our objectives here in a more limited way than just whatever the
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.260]   Ukrainians say.
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.660]   But here's the reality, right?
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.500]   Again, this is one of the things when you get into American political discourse.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.440]   Everything isn't downstream of an American decision.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.860]   This will come down to the fortunes of war on the ground in Ukraine, which is partially
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:52.860]   a function of how much aid we give them, obviously.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:53.860]   Yes.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.860]   But the warnings on those weapons, right?
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:00.460]   Forty billion of weapons are going there and it's just this month's delivery.
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.460]   So I mean...
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.380]   And it's a good question to ask what happens to those weapons after, which I'm sure is
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.380]   a concern for Glenn as well.
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.220]   Do you believe our State Department is working for a negotiated peace?
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.900]   I don't know the inner workings of the State Department.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.700]   But should they be?
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:13.780]   No.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:17.300]   I think the war stops and the Ukrainians want it to stop.
[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.540]   Glenn, your view on that?
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:23.300]   There's so many countries all over the world who want the United States to do things that
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.340]   we don't do for them.
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:31.140]   The Yemenis have been begging the United States for six years to stop sending huge amounts
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:35.220]   of weaponry and intelligence to the Saudis.
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.940]   And you can say, "Oh yeah, Yemen's a totally different country."
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.780]   Yemen's a different country, but it's still the United States government.
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:46.820]   And it is extremely disturbing to me, I have to say, that we suddenly seem to care so much
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:53.100]   about the lives of Ukrainians and seem to care very little about the lives of all the
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.660]   countries in which we ourselves are the aggressors.
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:59.600]   And you can say, "Well, that's a completely different issue."
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.940]   But it's not a completely different issue because what the outcome is of the United
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:07.980]   States' role in Ukraine is determined by the U.S. motive.
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:13.060]   And what you have to do to look at what the U.S. motive is, is not pick the rhetoric that
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.660]   makes you feel good.
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.220]   We're on the side of liberation.
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.580]   That's what George Bush said in his 2003 State of the Union speech.
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:24.260]   We're going to Iraq because we love democracy and we're going to liberate the Iraqi people
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:25.780]   from Saddam Hussein.
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:29.960]   That's what Lyndon Johnson said about why we're getting involved in the war in Vietnam.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:34.220]   We love the South Vietnamese Democrats and we're going there to protect them from the
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.260]   South Vietnamese communists.
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:40.060]   Maybe if that had been true, those wars would have had much different outcomes, but that
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.100]   wasn't the reason.
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.540]   That was the propagandistic pretense.
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:49.540]   And so to refuse to say, "I'm going to interrogate the authenticity of what U.S. motives are,"
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:54.500]   is to just wash your hands of the reality of the war instead of what you hope the war
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.500]   is.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.500]   And that's—
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.500]   Let's give Antonio the last word.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:58.500]   Yeah, okay.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.500]   I'm going to give you the last word.
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:04.540]   We're going to give Antonio the last word since he was a little bit outgunned here.
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:08.260]   Not outgunned because you did more than fine on your own, but there was a little bit of
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.260]   two on one.
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.260]   So we're going to give Antonio the last word.
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.900]   David, what were you guys talking about?
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:14.460]   Somalia apparently or Yemen apparently.
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.620]   But anyhow, so when I was coming back from Ukraine and I was crossing back and suddenly
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.820]   I was—obviously I wasn't really a refugee, but I was in the refugee line along with all
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.260]   the other Ukrainians leaving.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.260]   And you're at the border.
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.260]   It's the middle of nowhere, by the way.
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.540]   It's not like a big city or anything.
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:29.060]   And you saw a sign in Polish that said, "You're entering Poland," and the EU flag, right?
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:32.460]   And as an EU citizen, that flag never really meant much to me.
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:36.380]   And again, not that my time in Ukraine was that bad, but it did feel precarious and it
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.380]   was a war zone and sirens going off and all that stuff.
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.660]   To go back to what seemed like an ordered liberal world seemed magical to me.
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:42.660]   I had the same feeling.
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:46.540]   I went to report on Cuba on the internet years ago for Wired magazine, and when I landed
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.940]   at Miami Airport here, it was like, "Man, God bless America.
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:49.940]   I'm glad to be back here.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:52.260]   There's a certain order and rules to life."
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:57.020]   I think the global liberal order is real, and I think those who tend to shit on it or
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:01.140]   at least question its value are those that typically tend not to live outside of it,
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.700]   for one, and undervalue its importance in the world.
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.620]   Ladies and gentlemen, a debate for the ages.
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:07.620]   Well done.
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:10.780]   (audience applauding)
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.360]   (upbeat music)
