[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.460]   Hello again, thank you for listening to Ask Pastor John, the game show where we try to
[00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.780]   stump John Piper into confused silence seven years in, and it hasn't happened yet. I'm
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.180]   your host, Tony Reike, trying to do it. Pastor John, today's question will, of course, prompt
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.440]   a lot of thoughts for you, namely about the distinction between Calvinism and Arminianism
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.500]   when it comes to the power of God's grace. As listeners may know, you are hoping to finish
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.380]   up this summer writing a big new book on God's providence. So I know these questions about
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.580]   God's sovereignty are on the front of your mind already. Here's the email.
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.540]   "Hello, Pastor John. I'm a 26-year-old man in full-time ministry working primarily with
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.200]   collegiate golfers. In a recent Bible study, one of the older men in our group brought
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.880]   up the topic of 'prevenient grace,' the idea that the Holy Spirit enables everyone to potentially
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.300]   believe if they choose to cooperate. I was unprepared in the moment to respond. I am
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.320]   Reformed and believe wholly in the sovereignty of God and salvation. I believe we are saved
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.960]   by grace through faith, and this faith is not our own doing but is rather a gift of
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.100]   God coming to the elect from outside of us, all according to Ephesians 2.8. But I was
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.880]   really unprepared to respond in that moment. I'd love to hear your answer. How do you address
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.960]   'prevenient grace?'"
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:30.660]   There are two very different views of how God's grace functions in bringing people from
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:39.720]   spiritual darkness and deadness and unbelief into the light and life and faith which we
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:48.720]   call salvation and union with Christ. And if it helps, you can call the one view "Arminianism,"
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.520]   because one of its early and foremost advocates was Jacob Arminius, and you can call the other
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.800]   view—the one I'm going to argue for—"Calvinism," because one of its foremost advocates was
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:10.920]   John Calvin. But the names "Arminianism" and "Calvinism" are not important in comparison
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.520]   to what's really at stake, and that is one of them more biblical, is one of them more
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:25.280]   biblical than the other. Now, both of these views agree that until the grace of God is
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:33.320]   active and powerful in the human heart, there is only deadness and rebellion and unbelief,
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:40.240]   with no possibility of man bringing about the changes in his own heart that are necessary
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.200]   for salvation. We need to get that clear, because sometimes Calvinists don't describe
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:55.560]   Arminianism correctly there. Historic Arminianism agrees with Calvinism that fallen man, apart
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:05.280]   from special grace, cannot give himself life or produce his own faith. The difference lies
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:14.340]   in what this divine grace does in the human heart and how it relates to the will of man.
[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.600]   So "prevenient grace," which is what we're being asked about, "prevenient grace" is
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:31.040]   a phrase used by Arminians usually to describe the work of God's grace prior to faith—hence
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:39.200]   the word "prevenient," coming before—and without which faith would not be possible.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.680]   That's what an Arminian would say. So let me read some words from a prominent Arminian
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:54.480]   theologian, Roger Olson, from his book Against Calvinism, to make sure that I express the
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:05.040]   view fairly. I want you to hear the very words of Dr. Olson as a historic, faithful, insightful
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.400]   Arminian, and here's what he says. Everything I say now is going to be a quote until I tell
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:19.200]   you otherwise. "If anyone comes to Christ with repentance and faith, it is only because
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:28.600]   they are enabled by God's prevenient grace to do so." Page 66. Another quote. "Arminianism
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:36.600]   has always insisted that the initiative in salvation is God's. It is called 'prevenient
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:47.400]   grace' and is enabling but resistible." Page 169. Another quote. "Wesley affirmed
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:55.280]   original sin, including total depravity, in the sense of spiritual helplessness, but he
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:02.200]   also affirmed God's universal gift"—so everybody gets this—"universal gift of
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:11.880]   prevenient or enabling grace that restores freedom of the will." Page 129. Another
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:19.680]   quote. "Classical Arminian theology attributes the sinner's ability to respond to the gospel
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.840]   with repentance and faith to 'prevenient grace.'" Now let me insert a comment here.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.680]   Just to be clear, he says the ability to respond is given with prevenient grace, but it's
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.960]   an ability to believe or not to believe, and he'll make that really plain in just a minute.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.600]   Continuing the quote now. "The illuminating, convicting, calling, enabling power of the
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:53.960]   Holy Spirit working in the sinner's soul makes them free to choose saving grace or
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:02.260]   reject it." Page 67. So prevenient grace brings one out of bondage to the point where
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:11.560]   you can receive or reject the work of God in your heart. Another quote. "So in Arminian
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.360]   theology, a partial regeneration"—now this is his phrase, I didn't know this phrase
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:25.880]   till I read this—"a partial regeneration does precede conversion, but it's not a
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:35.520]   complete regeneration. It is an awakening and enabling, but not an irresistible force.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:44.120]   Prevenient grace is God's powerful, attracting, and persuading power that actually imparts
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:52.480]   free will to be saved or not." Page 171. Now that's the end of my quotation so that
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:59.400]   you could hear how a historic Arminian would describe their own understanding of prevenient
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:08.840]   grace. Those are all quotations. And the question is whether that understanding of how grace
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:17.440]   works to bring about our faith is biblical, or whether the Calvinist view is biblical,
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:26.840]   which says God's grace doesn't just bring us up to a point in a "partial regeneration"—that's
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:35.720]   his term—and then stop and leave the outcome to our ultimate self-determination. Now that's
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:42.160]   my term, "ultimate self-determination." Olson doesn't use that. I think it's fair,
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:50.400]   and I think it's right, in trying to get across the fact that man, not God, does the
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:08:00.720]   final and the ultimately decisive act. I know that the word "decisive" is a little
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.880]   slippery, and I'm trying to be clear and fair. Ultimately decisive, the very final
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:16.880]   act that brings me into Christ is that decisive moment in conversion is one that I perform,
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:27.520]   not God. Now let me continue. Calvinism says that God does more in our conversion—namely,
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:38.320]   he overcomes all of our resistance and opens the eyes of our hearts to make Christ so real
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:45.960]   and so beautiful and so compelling that our will gladly embraces Christ as our Savior
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:53.480]   and Lord and Treasure. So the question is, which of those is the biblical view of how
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:09:01.080]   God's grace brings us to faith and salvation? Does it make us free to choose grace or reject
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:09.800]   it? Or does it overcome our rebellion and blindness so that we are drawn triumphantly
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:16.440]   by the beauty of Christ to embrace what is true and real?
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:24.240]   Now as you ponder which of these two views is biblical, and you search the Scriptures,
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:31.080]   I would just point to one passage, and we could point to others, but just to save time,
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:41.440]   I'll point to one passage of Scripture that I think shows the complete saving effectiveness
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:50.160]   of God's grace and that God provides more than a partial regeneration in order to bring
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:58.200]   us to faith. And that passage is Ephesians 2, verses 4 through 7. So let me read it.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:06.400]   "God being rich in mercy because of the great love with which he loved us even when
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:15.480]   we were dead in our trespasses," and now comes two verbs of what God being rich in
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:26.920]   mercy does. Number one, "made us alive together with Christ." That's what he does
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:39.360]   for dead sinners. He made us alive with Christ, not just alive to reject Christ, but alive
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:45.200]   with Christ. And then he adds this parenthetical phrase, "By grace you have been saved,"
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:52.040]   in order to show, I think, what grace actually does. It makes us alive with Christ. And then
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:59.760]   here's the second verb, "and raised us up with him." He made us alive together
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:06.080]   with Christ, and he raised us up. So he brings us alive out of the grave of our fallenness,
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:12.000]   and he raises us up with Christ, seats us in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.480]   that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace and kindness
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:24.240]   toward us in Christ Jesus. I don't think that text can be fairly interpreted to mean
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:31.360]   that there is a split in regeneration or a split in making alive, and he does part of
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:36.160]   it, and then he waits to see what we will do with the rest of it if we will finish the
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:43.880]   making alive and bringing ourselves into union with Christ. I don't think that will work.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:51.340]   And so the difference between me—and I think I speak for virtually all Calvinists on this
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:57.880]   point, and Arminians—is not that one believes in total depravity and the other doesn't.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:04.640]   No, that's not it. And it's not—the difference is not that one believes that grace must precede
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:11.040]   faith and the other doesn't. No, no, that's not the difference either. Rather, that I
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:20.480]   believe what God's saving grace does is not merely restore a kind of free will that
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:30.040]   can accept or reject Christ, but rather opens our blind eyes, grants us to see the compelling
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:38.880]   truth and beauty and worth of Jesus in such a way that we find him irresistible. And so
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:48.360]   gladly, and willingly embrace him as our Savior and Lord and treasurer. He brings us all the
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:56.800]   way to the point of conversion so that we give him all the glory for our receiving of
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.800]   Jesus.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:03.320]   Amen. Made alive in Christ, made alive to Christ, and all to the glory of his sovereign
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:07.880]   grace. Thank you, Pastor John, for outlining one of the key differences here. And if this
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:13.040]   is all rather new to you and you want to better understand Calvinism in general, see Pastor
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:18.760]   John's book titled "Five Points." You can download the 100-page book free of charge
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:25.160]   right now. Go to DesiringGod.org/books and look for the title "Five Points." Well,
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.320]   that's F-I-V-E, "Five Points," and you'll find it there.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.200]   Well, as you can imagine, we get a lot of questions about what it means to live as a
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:39.240]   child of God. How does God's disposition change towards us? And specifically, is God angry
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:46.080]   at his children when they sin? Is God angry at me when I sin? That's on Wednesday when
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.560]   we return. It's a great question. I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you then.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.300]   [END]
