[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280]   If you turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 2 verses 9 through 13, we're going
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.880]   to be finishing up this section focusing on verses 11 through 13, but I want to read it
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.960]   in context in Hebrews chapter 2 verses 9 through 13.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.640]   But we do see him who was made for a little while lower than the angels, namely Jesus,
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.100]   because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.580]   of God he might taste death for everyone.
[00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.280]   For it was fitting for him for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.680]   bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.360]   For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from the Father, for which
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.600]   reason he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying, "I will proclaim your name to my brethren
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.000]   in the midst of the congregation.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.880]   I will sing your praise.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.760]   And again I will put my trust in him.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.440]   And again behold, I and the children whom God has given me."
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.640]   Let's pray.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.800]   Heavenly Father, you truly are a gracious and loving God.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:20.800]   We eagerly wait to see what heaven would be like, to know you close up, to be able to
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.480]   worship you, Father God, truly in spirit and in truth, without the hindrance of our sinful
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.120]   flesh.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.800]   I pray that you would open our eyes to the visions that you show us, Lord God, through
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.000]   your word, that our reality would become more and more real in Christ.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.540]   So I pray for your blessing, your powerful spirit, Lord God, would lead, and the grace
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.040]   of Jesus would guide and lead.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.760]   You know, obviously every part of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation is inerrant.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.320]   But when you study the Bible, you'll see that there are certain things that kind of are
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.320]   highlighted.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.080]   Just like if you're writing an essay or reading a book, there are certain chapters that you
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.120]   know that all the previous chapters kind of built to set up.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.440]   And then there are other chapters that kind of point back to that.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.040]   Well, that's obviously the gospel.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.280]   Even reading the Old Testament, it builds to set up for the coming of Christ.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.960]   Everything that we know after that is pointing back to what Christ has done.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.440]   But even within the gospel, there are certain things that are highlighted, that all of the
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.720]   suffering, all of the beating and death and resurrection, even within the gospel, there
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:44.280]   is a peak in it that all of the gospel itself points to, and all of the rest of the gospel
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.360]   points back to.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.960]   The text that we're looking at today is one of those texts that highlight that.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.840]   So I can't emphasize enough how important this is.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.320]   And again, what we've been studying in the book of Hebrews, everything that we've been
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.680]   studying in the book of Romans really is highlighted in what he's saying in this text.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.700]   So if we're not careful, you can just read this through and just kind of add that to
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.360]   many other things that you understand about the gospel.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.440]   But again, I'm asking you to pay very close attention because this is at the heart of
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.280]   the gospel.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.960]   If you miss this and you get everything else, you could easily miss the gospel itself.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.120]   We've been talking about what Jesus has done, his suffering, and how he did all of this
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.920]   and sacrificed all of this to bring many people to glory in Hebrews chapter 2.10.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.200]   "For it was fitting for him for whom are all things and through whom are all things,
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.120]   bringing many sons to glory to perfect the altar of their salvation through suffering."
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.960]   Again, you could just read that and just kind of skim through it and say, "Well, he did
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.180]   all of this to bring many sons to glory."
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.560]   The heart of the gospel is what he just said.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.520]   The point of his suffering, he says, is to bring us to glory.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.600]   The Bible describes the sin of mankind as what?
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.800]   All have sinned and fall short of what?
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.280]   His glory.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.240]   So all of mankind, all of the sin, all of the state of human beings is summarized in
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.800]   falling short of that glory.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.240]   So when he says in Hebrews chapter 2.10 that he suffered and died and was resurrected,
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.840]   became one of us, all for the purpose of what?
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.160]   To bring us back to that glory.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.680]   It is at the heart of the gospel.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.160]   Salvation isn't simply not going to hell.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.000]   If you see salvation is simply not going to hell, Jesus died for us, I'm justified, so
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.800]   let's just live until we get to heaven and heaven will be better.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.120]   It's good here, it'll be better over there.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.800]   Salvation isn't simply not going to hell.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.640]   Salvation is not about how hard this life is and if Jesus comes in, he makes it better.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.800]   That we have security and peace and he allows the husband and wife relationship to grow
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.640]   stronger and raise children in a good godly environment and build a church where we can
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.480]   share of one another.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.480]   That is not the salvation.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.320]   Those are all byproducts of salvation.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:17.440]   The core of the problem is that the glory that God has created us for was tainted because
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.520]   of sin.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.960]   And so all of salvation is summarized is to bring us back to that glory.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.200]   So all of that is a setup.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.640]   Everything that we've been studying is a setup to what he's about to say in verse 11.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.080]   So what is that?
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.840]   If the whole point of salvation points to restoring us back to glory, what is that glory?
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.240]   And we have to be careful that we don't project our idea of glory.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.960]   Like yesterday we won the women's softball championship and it's like, "Oh, we experienced
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.800]   some of that glory."
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:58.120]   Or you do a great job in your presentation or you're working hard as a salesman or an
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.200]   engineer and something great happened and you were acknowledged and so you got some
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.240]   of that glory.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.840]   We have to be careful that we understand how the Bible describes this glory and that's
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.480]   exactly what he does in verse 11.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:17.600]   There's two things that he says here that describes this glory in detail.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.360]   One, he says to be brought to glory means to be united with Christ.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.760]   He describes this union as a union between two brothers, that we've become brothers because
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.920]   of what Christ has done.
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.800]   Hebrews 2.11, "For both he who sanctifies and those who are sanctifier are all from
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   one family."
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.160]   In other words, we have become united with Christ because of what he has done, for which
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.320]   reason he is not ashamed to call them brethren.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:51.000]   This union with Christ, Charles Spurgeon said, "There is no joy in the world like union with
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.440]   Christ.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.080]   The more we can feel it, the happier we are."
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.880]   John Piper, talking about the same union with Christ, "Union with Christ is the center of
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:08.720]   our salvation and our sanctification and central to all of our deepest joys in this life."
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.880]   So again, it is not an exaggeration to say this union with Christ is at the crux of our
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.880]   salvation.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.040]   And then John Murray, again, writing about union with Christ, he said, "It is the central
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.520]   truth of the whole doctrine of salvation.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:31.640]   It is not simply a phase of application of redemption, it underlies every aspect of redemption."
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:39.680]   So this idea of being united back in this family as Jesus as our brother is at the core
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.680]   of our salvation.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.320]   The whole point of his death and resurrection, the whole point of his suffering is to bring
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.400]   us to glory, and this bringing us to glory means that we are united back with Jesus'
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.080]   glory, which we fell short of.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.000]   And it says, "When this glory happens," what does the Bible say?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.760]   "When a sinner repents and he is restored, all of heaven rejoices."
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.800]   Now, why do they rejoice?
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:12.520]   If we simply see it as a sinner who is deserving of hell, and God forgives them and then they
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.640]   are restored back, why are they rejoicing?
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:24.160]   You know, the best way for us to understand this, if we do not see our union with Christ
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:30.360]   as restoration of family, like brothers, we don't understand the affection.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:36.360]   We don't understand the affection, the personal affection that belongs and that's at the core
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.480]   of our salvation.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:44.080]   The gospel was never meant to be taken cognitively alone.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.480]   At the core of it, there's a set of doctrines, there's teachings that we acknowledge and
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.040]   say, "Well, we believe that."
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.120]   But if that's all it is, what does the Bible say?
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.240]   It's demonic.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.960]   Because even the demons will acknowledge who God is, that He's an almighty God.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.680]   But the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian is a Christian, this set of
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.280]   doctrine that they believe it's for them, and that this union with Christ is restored
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.480]   and they become one family.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:17.920]   And the reason why the heaven rejoices is because this family is reunited.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:25.480]   Years ago, back in the '80s sometime, I remember watching a program where many Korean families
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:32.480]   who were separated during the Korean War, because Korea was so poor, during the escape
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.100]   from North Korean army coming, and many families, like we have so many young families here with
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.100]   young children.
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.520]   Can you imagine packing up everything that you own in your car and just going, and in
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.440]   the process of going, you lose one of your kids and you don't reunite with them?
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.920]   I mean, the whole country experienced that.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:55.000]   Husband and wives, grandparents with uncles, and even children.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.200]   Mothers who had five, 10-year-old children got separated crossing one of these rivers,
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.520]   and by the time they got to the other side, they don't know if they drowned to death,
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.640]   they don't know if they got killed, they don't know if North Korea and South Korea, when
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.320]   they got separated, if they got dragged into North Korea, they didn't know.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:16.560]   So for 30 years, they lived longing to be reunited either here or in heaven or somewhere,
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.560]   'cause they didn't know what happened.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:22.720]   Well, I don't know why it took 30 years for a reporter to come up with this idea, and
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.480]   this reporter said, "You know what?
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.560]   Now that the country has television and is able to communicate a little bit better,"
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:34.760]   he had an idea that he's gonna take the pictures of children and parents and uncles that they
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.560]   were separated, and they started posting it up on the wall.
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:44.080]   And so all these families, hundreds and thousands of people who lost their children or separated,
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:48.560]   began to go back to these walls and they found out many of these families actually lived
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.760]   in the same city.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:55.560]   And young children who were separated from their moms when they were 10, 11, even young
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:01.520]   as five-year-old, 30 years, they didn't see their parents, and then this...
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.800]   I saw the program where they were being reunited.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:12.080]   Can you imagine the sadness of seeing your child last time as a five-year-old, and then
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.440]   next time you see him, he's a 35-year-old man?
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:21.640]   Or seeing your mother as a 35-year-old, and then seeing her as a 65-year-old?
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:27.880]   And the tears of sadness, but at the same time, the tears of joy of being reunited with
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.880]   their family.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:36.280]   And the Bible says that when a sinner repents and he is restored, the reason why they celebrate
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:43.600]   is because the glory that God has created mankind for, this family unit, was destroyed.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:51.080]   And to be restored back to this glory, Jesus comes to restore us to him that we may be
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.280]   restored into this family.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:59.840]   That's why this union with Christ as our fellow brother is at the core of the goal of salvation.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.160]   It isn't just not going to hell.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.600]   It isn't just going to heaven.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.160]   It's being reunited to this family.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.200]   That's why it's emotional.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.920]   That's why when a sinner comes to Christ, it is not just a declaration of doctrine.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.360]   I believe that I stand here or I stand there.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:27.800]   There's a child who lost his family being restored back.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:32.520]   I saw the Bible repeatedly over and over describes our salvation as union with Christ.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:37.320]   Galatians 2.20, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.760]   Christ who lives in me.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.480]   And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.860]   me and gave himself up for me."
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.040]   When Jesus was crucified, we were united with him.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.000]   When he was buried, we were united in his burial.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.720]   When he was raised, we were united with him that we may be united with him in life.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.160]   In fact, this union is so intimate.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:07.040]   In 2 Corinthians 2.14, it describes us as the fragrance of Christ.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:12.200]   There's a few of us in this room who's been married for more than 20 years, right?
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.000]   And some of you 10, 5.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.100]   But the longer you live together, you really become one.
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.560]   You start to look alike.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.160]   You start to have similar taste.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.840]   And then eventually, you start smelling the same.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:33.440]   Because the same soap, you use the same soap, you use the same, you know, same shampoo,
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.360]   the same soap to wash your clothes, you use the same thing.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.840]   So eventually, you don't realize it because that's all you smell in the room.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.880]   But after a while, you even have a similar aroma, okay?
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.520]   I know I'm milking that illustration, but you know what I'm talking about, right?
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.400]   You see couples who've been together for a long time, they actually start to even look
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.500]   alike.
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:58.360]   It describes our union with Christ as so intimate, he says that our presence in this world is
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.360]   the what?
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.360]   Fragrance of Christ.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:10.240]   In fact, in Colossians 3.3-4, our future life and glory is directly tied to Jesus' glory.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.960]   For you have died and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:19.080]   When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.280]   glory.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.160]   Our hope, our joy, our life, all of it is directly tied with Christ because we have
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.760]   been united with Christ in His death and His resurrection.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.440]   That's why an individual who says that he is a believer and yet does not have a relationship
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.840]   with Jesus Christ is an oxymoron.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:43.800]   That's a contradiction because the whole point of salvation is to be restored in relationship.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:48.420]   So I know it's a cliche that it's not a religion, it's about a relationship, but it's a cliche
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.080]   for a reason because it's true.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:58.040]   It's a cliche that is abused, it is misapplied, but at the core of the message, it's truth.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.640]   It is not simply about coming to church.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.680]   It is not simply about doing the right things.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.560]   It's about a personal relationship with Jesus Christ because that's how it is described
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.460]   in the Scripture.
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:13.880]   To be restored back in glory means to be restored back in our union with Christ.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:21.440]   But here, it doesn't end there because our union with Christ causes us to be united with
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.440]   the Father.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.280]   To be brought to glory means to have God as our Father.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:33.120]   Verse 11, "For both he who is sanctified and those who are sanctified are all from one
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.640]   Father."
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:42.480]   Now this idea of God as our Father, that's the distinction between a Christian and a
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.120]   non-Christian.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:52.240]   A Christian and a non-Christian, the distinction is a non-Christian sees God and he believes
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.760]   that God exists.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.340]   And he may believe that God is wise.
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.680]   He may believe that God is almighty and powerful.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.080]   But a non-believer will never see God as his Father.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.440]   That's the distinction.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.640]   It is not a distinction between a believer of God and an unbeliever of God.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:18.200]   So we see that very clearly in John chapter 8, in verse 32, where Jesus is talking to
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.360]   Jews who had believed him.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.320]   He says, "If you abide in the truth, you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.320]   free."
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.320]   And they get angry.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.320]   "What do you mean we'd set you free?
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.320]   We were never enslaved."
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.320]   And they go back and forth.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.200]   And then in verse 44, it says, "You do not believe what I say because your Father is
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   the devil."
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.060]   God is not your Father.
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.660]   So the distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian is not one who believes and
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:49.280]   professes right doctrine, but is one who is able to call him or her Abba Father versus
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.440]   somebody who just says that he believes in this being.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:59.560]   Karl Barth says of this, "Perhaps you recall how when Hitler used to speak about God, he
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.480]   called him the Almighty.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.400]   It is not the Almighty who is God.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.960]   We cannot understand from the standpoint of a supreme concept of power who God is.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.520]   The man who calls the Almighty God misses God in the most terrible way."
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:18.720]   Hitler, obviously, was not a believer.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.360]   Who would ever defend his faith?
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.360]   And yet, he was not an atheist.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:29.880]   In fact, he himself declared that he believed in the Judeo-Christian God, and he called
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.880]   him the Almighty God.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:38.360]   What Karl Barth is saying, to call him Almighty without knowing him as a father, all it produces
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.960]   is terror.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.360]   It does not produce salvation.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:50.080]   Now, let me ask you, when you think of something very powerful, what do you think of?
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:57.200]   Some of you guys may be thinking Spider-Man, Superman, Iron Man.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.980]   I'm talking about reality, not fantasy.
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:05.060]   When you think of something powerful, very powerful, I don't know how many of you have
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.240]   ever experienced a hurricane or a typhoon.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.280]   I mean, it is scary.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.880]   You know, I had a glimpse of that when I was a young child, and our family went on a trip
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:21.120]   with our cousins and uncles, and we were at a coast, and a typhoon came in.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.520]   And what freaked me out wasn't the typhoon.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:29.520]   What freaked me out was adults freaking out, because I was a young kid, and they were scared
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.680]   to death because this typhoon came in, and they saw trees being blown over, and from
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.680]   a distance, we could see houses getting knocked over.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:43.400]   And we were in this small, tiny house, and similar houses are being blown in a distance,
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:48.160]   and all our uncles and older cousins, they're freaking out.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.640]   And I look out the window, and I see this crazy stuff happening, but I was a little
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:57.360]   kid, but seeing the adults freaking out freaked me out.
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.880]   You don't normally think of a typhoon or something powerful like that and think, "Wow, I'm glad
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.640]   the typhoon came because there's a leak in my roof, and maybe that's gonna fix it."
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.560]   You don't think of order when you think of power.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.560]   When you think of...
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.560]   How many of you experienced an earthquake?
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.860]   I'm not talking about a light shake.
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:20.580]   When I was in college, I lived next to a train track, which I do now also.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.160]   So a little movement doesn't bother me.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.720]   I don't even wake up for that, 'cause I've gotten so used to it.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:33.520]   Some of you guys may remember, most of you will now, but some of you will remember the
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.000]   Northwood earthquake, and that was huge.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.880]   4-5 freeway just collapsed.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.840]   We knew somebody who bought a house right before the earthquake, and the house just
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.440]   cracked in half, and everybody who had homes back there saw damage.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:51.040]   But to me, that wasn't the biggest earthquake, even though on record it was the biggest earthquake
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.040]   in a long time.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:58.560]   But there was another earthquake prior to that in 1987 or something, the Whittier earthquake.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:04.160]   And when that Whittier earthquake hit, I was maybe a sophomore in college, and I was standing
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:10.360]   at the Biola parking lot, and I saw the parking lot wave.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.800]   I don't know, some of you guys may know, some earthquakes shake like that, and some earthquakes
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.800]   wave.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.920]   This was one of those wavy ones.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.320]   And I just got out of my car, getting ready to go to Old Testament survey class, and I
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:25.160]   stood there, and I initially heard the rumbling, and next thing I knew, the car on the other
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.420]   side of the parking lot started rising.
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:32.040]   And then it started doing this wave, right?
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:37.080]   And then I saw the building that I was standing next to start to swerve.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.200]   And I said, "Oh my gosh, this is it."
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.840]   I was waiting for the earth to open up and something disastrous happened.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.440]   And it happened for a while.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.180]   And I saw my fellow classmates who already got into the classroom opening up windows
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.280]   and jumping out.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:56.040]   It was on the first floor, so it wasn't that dangerous.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.520]   They might have used that as an excuse to leave the class, but they were coming out
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.520]   of the class, and I remember all of us were just freaking out, right?
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:12.760]   When you think of something that powerful, you don't automatically think peace, joy.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:19.000]   There's a reason why people don't want nuclear plants around their homes, even if it is built
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.200]   for a good reason.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:27.160]   Because if something goes wrong, the power that is contained in this nuclear plant can
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.880]   wipe out the whole city.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:35.920]   We don't automatically think that something that contains this much power is safe.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:42.920]   So to view the Almighty God, I mean, we're uncomfortable with a typhoon.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.760]   We're uncomfortable with tsunamis and earthquakes.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:54.840]   The God of the universe who created all things, the Almighty God, doesn't induce peace and
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.600]   joy and hope.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.040]   All it produces is terror.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:08.560]   And that's where natural man in his natural state is completely blind.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:15.760]   Because in his natural state, somehow he is convinced that if he dies, that he's going
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:22.520]   to confront this almighty power, and he's going to be introduced to glory and peace
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.200]   and life.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.600]   Why would they think that?
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.080]   It's complete deception.
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:35.040]   Because naturally, when we think of any power, we would be concerned what is going to happen
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.960]   if we confront this power.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:43.080]   That's what Karl Barth means when he says, "If all we know God is the Almighty God, not
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.820]   only is it a mistake, there's horrendous consequences."
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.760]   The Bible describes him as an almighty God.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:55.880]   In fact, prior to this passage, he said, "All things are made by him and for him."
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.720]   All creation was created by his hands.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.920]   But along with that, God is continually introduced to us as a father.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:10.240]   Exodus, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, Israel is called repeatedly, "My firstborn son."
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:15.080]   Deuteronomy 1.31, he carries his people as a father carries his son.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.560]   Deuteronomy, in Hebrews 12, he disciplines his people as father disciplines his son.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:24.720]   In Psalm, Jeremiah, Malachi, he has compassion, his father has compassion on his son.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:31.000]   And Isaiah himself prays in Isaiah 63, "You are our father."
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.200]   Despite this repeated presentation of the Almighty God as the father of Israel, there
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:45.120]   is no record of a single Jewish rabbi who prays to God as father before or after Christ.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:51.200]   And that's why it was so strange that the first Jewish rabbi who comes and prays to
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.680]   God as Abba Father is Jesus himself.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:00.720]   In fact, exclusively, with the exception of one, every time he prays to God, he prays
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.520]   to him as father.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:06.500]   And when the disciples asked Jesus, "How should we pray?"
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:13.120]   He says, "Pray in this way, 'Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.'"
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.880]   It was such a foreign concept to the Jews, even though it is peppered all throughout
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:22.000]   the Old Testament Scripture, that they thought it was blasphemous.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.600]   How can a mere man claim him to be the father, not realizing the division between a believer
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.640]   and non-believer is the Father and just the Almighty?
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:36.280]   In fact, the Jews are so afraid of his presence and making a mistake that they wouldn't even
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.600]   pronounce his name.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.240]   They don't even, even to this day, is it Jehovah?
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.240]   Is it Yahweh?
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.280]   Because they didn't pronounce his name.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:48.000]   Every time his name was put in Scripture, they said, "We're going to say Adonai, just
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.640]   in case we make a mistake and God strikes us down."
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:58.000]   Michael Reeves, in his book, "Delighting in the Trinity," says this, "For it is only when
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.560]   we see that God rules his creation as a kind and loving father that we will be moved to
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:08.200]   delight in his providence."
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:14.760]   Our worship, our obedience, our hope is to be based on his love.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:23.080]   Longing for heaven is not just longing to not have hardship or sorrow or to be lonely.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.600]   Longing for heaven is a longing for the Father.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:33.520]   Our desire for obedience, he calls for love.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:38.760]   That's why the greatest commandment, all the commandments of keeping the Sabbath holy,
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.920]   taking care of the poor, everything he says is summed up in this one commandment.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.240]   Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.960]   Why does the God Almighty want to be loved?
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.360]   Respected, feared, revered, obeyed?
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:58.080]   But he said loved.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.020]   Loved.
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.320]   Why does he want to be loved by sinful creatures?
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.520]   Why does he want to be loved?
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:10.320]   Not just respected and feared, but to be loved.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.360]   Who are we?
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.120]   What are we?
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:20.120]   The only thing that makes sense is because he sees us as his children.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:25.520]   And that's why he says, "You can have all these things.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.840]   You can give your body to be burnt.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.240]   And if you do not have love," what does he say?
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.160]   "It's nothing."
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:39.840]   Because at the center of what God desires from our salvation is love.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:45.120]   Because he is our Abba Father.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:50.640]   There's three ramifications of this restored relationship with God the Father.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:55.360]   One is that this love relationship is restored.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.680]   In John 3.35, "The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand."
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.600]   He's talking about the Son.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:07.360]   And again, John 5.20, "For the Father loves the Son and shows him all things that he himself is doing."
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:12.440]   So, repeatedly, over and over again, he said, "This is my Son in whom I am well pleased."
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:18.600]   As to be united with Christ means to be united in this love relationship with God the Father.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:24.800]   And that's why the Bible describes in John 3.16, what motivated God to send his only begotten Son?
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.280]   He so loved the world.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.680]   It was love.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.400]   It was his compassion.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:36.160]   As he saw his lost children like prodigal children who went away to restore that glory,
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:40.920]   so when he comes back, "What do I need to do?"
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.120]   To love.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.400]   That's what he requires.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.400]   That's a father asking the son.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.680]   You can have a child who obeys and does all these things, but then not have love,
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:56.120]   then, you know, that contradicts the relationship with the Father.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.800]   That's why it says in John 14.31, "But so that the world may know that I love the Father,
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.960]   I do exactly as the Father commanded me."
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.200]   His obedience was to demonstrate that love.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:13.280]   In 1 John 3.1, "See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us,
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:19.960]   that we would be called the children of God, and such we are."
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:26.800]   Look at the love that he has bestowed upon us.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:32.960]   The fact that we are called the children of God.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:39.480]   When he says, when the author says, "Enter his gates with thanksgiving in your hearts,"
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.880]   what is the core of that thanksgiving?
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.320]   What is the motivation behind that thanksgiving?
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.360]   Because we're being called to the Father's house.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:52.400]   When the Bible says, "To enter the throne of grace with confidence."
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.560]   Yes, he's the king, he's the almighty God.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.960]   But even if the governor, right?
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.400]   Even if the governor, and I'm not even going to say the president,
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.800]   even if the governor calls and says, "Hey, come to the governor's mansion,
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:08.440]   and we have the authority to go because we are invited," we don't enter there
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:12.400]   with confidence walking and saying, "This is the governor's house.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.200]   You put on your best dress, and you're humbled, but you don't go there
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.560]   with confidence."
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:26.280]   You know, my office upstairs, you know, it has sofas, right?
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.120]   And so that's where, you know, we have our leadership meeting.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.960]   But, you know, typically, you know, it's closed.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.320]   Every once in a while, I'll go in there, and I'll see one of my children lying
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.400]   down on my sofa.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.360]   And I have a refrigerator there, and I have some water, and sometimes some
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.520]   soda in there, and they'll just take it out and drink it.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.520]   Never got my permission, right?
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.840]   They don't ask me.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:48.360]   They just do it.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.680]   So sometimes, they're there, something's missing, or I'll see a bag sitting there,
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.720]   and I know it's one of my kids.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:59.000]   You know, I don't go in there, "How dare they put their bag in my room?"
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.520]   It's because it's their father's, because I'm their dad.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:07.520]   So that room is just an extension of the house because they do that at my house,
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.160]   right?
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.000]   They don't ring the doorbell when they come into the house.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.600]   They come in with confidence.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:20.320]   They open the door, and they just come right in, and they open the fridge.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.560]   They eat.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.640]   They take showers.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.360]   It's because that's their father's house.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:32.600]   When the Bible invites sinners to come into His presence with confidence,
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.360]   He's not simply inviting us to the throne.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:42.040]   He's not simply inviting us to the Almighty God who rules the universe.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:48.560]   He's inviting us to the inner room of Abba Father.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.720]   Because we have been united with Christ, we have been united with our God,
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.520]   the Father.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.560]   So the father-son relationship is a love relationship.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:05.200]   Second, the father-son relationship is naturally glorifies one another.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.160]   In verse 12, it says, "I will proclaim your name to my brethren.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.120]   In the midst of the congregation, I will sing your praise."
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.360]   Naturally, the father-son relationship glorifies each other.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:20.960]   That's why it says in John 17.1, Jesus says, "Jesus spoke these things,
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.720]   and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, 'Father, the hour has come.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.960]   Glorify your son that the son may glorify you.'"
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.080]   And again, in Hebrews 1.3, a passage that we studied again,
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.200]   Jesus is described as a radiance of His glory, the Father's glory,
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:40.440]   and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.200]   of His power.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.000]   When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.120]   of the Majesty on high.
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.280]   Some of you guys have children who play baseball or softball or soccer or
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:59.320]   basketball, and some of them are really good at it, right?
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.840]   And typically, if you see sports stars, right?
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:06.600]   And then right now, we're getting into the NBA Finals, and some of you guys may
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.680]   remember the Portland Trailblazers and the Warriors are playing.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.880]   He had two Curry brothers who were wearing two different uniforms,
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:17.520]   and the father wore the one son's uniform, the mother wore the other son's uniform.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:22.720]   And there was a lot of hoopla, a lot of attention paid to these two parents.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.160]   They didn't do anything.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.360]   All they did was have these children.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.960]   But the reason why there was so much attention given to them is because it's
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.080]   their kids.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:37.520]   And they're sitting back, and every time they did something fantastic,
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.480]   the camera would go to the parents.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.280]   How are they reacting?
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.920]   Now, why do they do that?
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.280]   You know, if one of the kids makes an awesome shot, you know,
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.760]   the parents are like, "That's my genetics."
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.520]   You know, that's years of the father's training in the gym.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.520]   The mother's athletic.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:00.280]   I hear that the mother's very athletic, and so you kind of see a glimpse of their
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.360]   upbringing and, you know, their mannerisms and all this stuff,
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.040]   and kind of going back to the parents because it points to them.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.080]   That's what the Bible says.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.920]   When we are restored into this relationship, our father and son relationship,
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.640]   naturally, what we do magnifies him.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.760]   And when he's magnified, we are magnified.
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:23.080]   And that's why the Bible says, "Be holy because he is holy."
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:28.000]   The motivation behind our holiness is not to appease this holy God.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.560]   It's because our sins and our ramification of sin has been justified,
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.000]   and we had this relationship with God restored.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.640]   He says, "Be holy because your father is holy."
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.640]   Reflect his holiness in your life.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.160]   Reflect his grace in your life.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:50.480]   So, naturally, this relationship with God glorifies one another,
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.960]   and that's what sanctification is.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:59.640]   So, if you do not see him as your Abba Father, if the love for God is not present,
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.240]   then this command to be holy because he is holy is like, "Well,
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:06.240]   why should I be holy because he's holy?"
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.360]   It's because we have this love relationship.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:13.280]   Third and finally, the father-son relationship invites us to put our trust
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.520]   in him naturally.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.960]   In verse 13, "And again, I will put my trust in him.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:24.080]   And again, behold, I and the children whom God has given me."
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:30.000]   Seeing God as almighty and only as almighty, one, it brings terror,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.520]   but it is very, very difficult to trust him.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.560]   Because when God says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God,
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:40.880]   and all these things shall be added unto you," if you're hearing that from an
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:50.240]   almighty God, we know that he is capable, but we don't know if he desires it
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.320]   because he's an almighty God.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:56.920]   And the only way that that promise becomes our promise is if we hear it
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.520]   from the Father.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:03.520]   So, an individual who does not have an affectionate relationship with God the
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.040]   Father hears that command of, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God,
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.640]   and all these things shall be added unto you," you hear like a
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.000]   banker making a promise.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.640]   If you invest your money here, you know, that there's going to be enough
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.440]   interest, and by the end, you'll get some money.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.880]   Do I trust this bank?
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.200]   What is their track record?
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.520]   What have they done in the past?
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.760]   What if the market crashes?
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:34.040]   So, all the commands of God are nothing more than things to observe and to test
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.080]   and to see if the balance sheet makes out.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:40.440]   And then if it seems like it's a good investment, and then it seems like if I do
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:44.160]   this, this is going to happen, okay, then I'll do it cautiously.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.480]   Let me give you the distinction between a father-son relationship and somebody not.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:54.440]   Like when I was younger, again in Korea, you know, like me and my friends,
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.360]   and I must have been no more than about four years old.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.640]   So, me and some of my friends went up to the roof.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.520]   It's not really a roof, you know, but it's pretty small.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.760]   It's probably no more than maybe about six feet tall.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.280]   My dad is not a tall man.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.080]   He's about my height.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:14.160]   And he saw us playing up there, and it was pretty dangerous.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.880]   So, as soon as he saw us up there, he said, "What are you doing up there?
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:17.480]   That's dangerous."
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.640]   So, he's asking us to come down.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.640]   And the only way for us to come down safely at that point was to go down that
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.400]   direction.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:29.080]   But we were small children, so my dad basically looked up at me and he said,
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:32.080]   "Jump."
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.200]   Again, this is not from second floor.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.480]   This is about six feet.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:40.640]   So, if my dad puts his hand up, it's enough for me to just kind of lean
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.880]   forward and for him to grab, right?
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:46.960]   So, it wasn't a, like, life-threatening thing that I'm doing, right?
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:50.200]   But my friends looked at me, I mean, they don't know this, man.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.840]   It's a risk for them, you know?
[00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:57.120]   So, they're being cautious, but because my dad, I know who he is, right?
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:00.080]   I mean, this wasn't a big risk.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.640]   And so, when he told me to come down, I just kind of leaned forward,
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.240]   and he caught me, and he brought me down, right?
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.280]   Because that's my dad.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:11.160]   That wasn't a local, you know, like, policeman or just anybody.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.440]   It was my dad telling me to come down.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:20.480]   My other friends looked at that and said, "Huh, maybe we can trust him."
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.240]   But they didn't jump down the way I jumped down.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.520]   I just kind of leaned forward, my dad grabbed me.
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.560]   They kind of stuck their feet out, you know what I mean?
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:31.600]   Holding on to the roof and kind of dragging themselves down as far as they
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:36.680]   can, and then hopefully this strange guy is going to catch them on the way.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.880]   And just gingerly, one by one, slowly, they crept down, and my dad helped them
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.800]   down.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:48.200]   The reason I share this story is because so many Christians live their lives
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:52.520]   because they don't see God as their father.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.840]   So, they're testing him, like they're testing the water.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.280]   Is it safe?
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.680]   Can I trust him?
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:02.320]   If I entrust him with my finances, if I entrust him with my family,
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.880]   is it really going to be okay?
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:07.880]   And just are slowly creeping into that.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.240]   And as a result of that, there's no joy.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:15.640]   Every commandment becomes a burden.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.680]   It's not a father who's calling him into his life.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.960]   It's not a father who's calling him into his inner chamber.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.880]   It's the Almighty God saying, "Do it."
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.800]   That's a distinction between a Christian who is living his life and his obedience
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:34.000]   is producing joy, versus another person who is living his life,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.480]   obeying, sacrificing, and all it produces is burden.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:43.760]   Father and son relationship naturally calls us to trust him.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:48.520]   James 1:17, "Every good thing given in every perfect gift is from above,
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:52.680]   coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.760]   or shifting shadow."
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:58.360]   God himself, his very nature, he gives good things.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:02.360]   In Matthew 7, 11, "If you then being evil know how to give good gifts
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:06.640]   to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give what is good
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:10.280]   to those who ask him?"
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:14.560]   To see God as our Father naturally produces trust in him.
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.760]   Let me wrap this up with this illustration.
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.600]   Let's say you're driving a car and you happen to get lost in this really
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.960]   horrible neighborhood, right?
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.400]   A relationship.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.280]   You can make of it whatever you want.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.520]   You get lost in this neighborhood, and I'm not going to name the neighborhood
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.040]   just in case, right?
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:39.320]   You're in this horrible neighborhood where it's known for their gang activity,
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.920]   there's drugs, there's prostitution, all kinds of things that are happening,
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.280]   and it's unsafe.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.480]   You would never go there, right?
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:49.720]   But for some odd reason, you're going to go get some churros or something,
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.760]   and you got lost.
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.960]   Just as an example, right?
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:57.160]   We were somewhere like that yesterday.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.760]   But let's say you got lost.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.720]   And all of a sudden, you're driving, and it gets dark, and you're trying
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:06.440]   to find it, and this is, you know, you don't have GPS in your car,
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:10.640]   and every turn that you make, it gets worse and worse, and you're starting
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.640]   to feel anxious.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.480]   "Oh, shoot, I better hurry and get out."
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:18.880]   Next thing you see, this is big semi behind you with this high beam on and
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.920]   coming after you.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.840]   And so your mind is racing, like, "What is this?
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.000]   Is this a drug lord?
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.400]   Is this a gang leader?
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.600]   Like, what's going on?"
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:30.560]   And so you're trying to evade this truck, and every turn that you make,
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.280]   that the truck is, like, coming and it's gaining.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:37.200]   And so you're trying so hard to get away, and then you make a wrong turn into this
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.960]   alley, and then you get trapped.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.440]   And next thing you know, the semi is coming with the high beam on,
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.480]   you can't see who it is, and you're imagining, "Oh, these things,
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.280]   this is maybe the end of my life.
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:53.360]   We're trapped," until the truck comes right by, and then the driver comes out,
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:58.640]   and it's your dad.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:04.880]   And you realize your dad was coming to get you because he heard that you got lost in
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.720]   this bad neighborhood.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.400]   But this isn't no ordinary dad.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:14.000]   This is the almighty dad.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.480]   The gangs are afraid of this guy.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:21.440]   Drug lords are trying hard to avoid him.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.480]   It's that dad.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.640]   He's the captain of the police dad.
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:30.160]   He comes out of the car, and at the moment you get a sight of that dad,
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.840]   every anxious thought that you had disappears.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:37.840]   And all you hear from him is, "I knew you were lost.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.200]   Get in the truck."
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.240]   And once you get in the truck, you're safe.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.760]   There's nobody coming after you.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.240]   Everybody's moving out of the way.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:53.680]   That's how salvation is described for us in Scripture.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:42:00.600]   He knew we were lost, and the almighty God, that all things were created by him
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:04.680]   and for him, became nothing.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.800]   He walked among us.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:11.800]   He brought us to himself, called us his brother, and then reintroduced us
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.880]   to the father.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:18.320]   And now, that's why he says, "Live up to the calling."
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.920]   The calling has been given to you freely.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.080]   He didn't give it to us because you had potential.
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:27.240]   He didn't give it to us because if I got you, that you have so much more that you
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:29.480]   can do for me than the other people.
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.040]   We weren't diamond in the rough.
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.880]   The Bible says we were dead in our trespasses.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:39.680]   And there's only way that we can find our way back is the father to come and get us.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.920]   And now that you're in the truck, he says, "Come to me, all who are weary
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:51.240]   and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest."
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:55.880]   That's what the salvation is, to give us rest in the father's arms.
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:04.480]   And that's why our sanctification is called to live up to what he has given us.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:08.600]   How could we not love this God?
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:13.760]   If we really believed it, how could we not obey this God?
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.960]   How could we not worship this God?
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:21.640]   How could we not declare this God and glorify this God if we really
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:25.360]   believe this God?
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:30.120]   Let me conclude with this passage, Romans 8, verse 15 to 17.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:35.400]   "For you have not received the spirit of slavery, leading to fear again,
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:39.800]   but you have received the spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out,
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:44.720]   'Abba, Father.'" The spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.360]   children of God.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:51.200]   And if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:56.760]   If indeed we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:57.760]   Let's pray.
