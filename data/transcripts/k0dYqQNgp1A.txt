[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.900]   at home, just a reminder if you are planning to regularly and consistently
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.720]   come, please do make sure to sign up on the registration and the form is at the
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:21.360]   top of the announcement section on the app and also our Facebook. For any of you
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:27.160]   who are switching services, we're trying to keep that roster as accurate as
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.800]   possible, so again if you're making a consistent change, please make sure to
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.720]   message Chris Kim, and her email is again on the app. One of the announcements I
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.640]   like to highlight is the Intentional Sisters Fellowship, where the plan is to
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:44.240]   come together in smaller groups, work through and read a book together and
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.200]   have discussions. If you'd like to participate in that, the last day to sign
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.160]   up is this Friday, so please make sure to take a moment to sign up for that if
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.280]   you'd like to fellowship with the other sisters open to our young adults and our
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:01.600]   family ministry. Another important announcement is for again for family, for
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.760]   those of you with children, that we have, we're going to be hosting the trunk
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:10.200]   formation night. That's going to be happening on October 31st. It's going to
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:15.840]   be a fun time, but we do need people who want to volunteer to set up those trunks
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:21.720]   to prepare activity or a treat for the children. Please volunteer now and the
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:27.520]   sign up for that also is on the app, and if you have questions, we have Rachel and
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:32.240]   Esther available there for any questions that you might have. So please again make
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.360]   sure you mark that on the calendar. The last and important announcement I have
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:41.540]   is for our education department. For those of you with children, we are
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:47.040]   planning to reopen our education department in increments, and so
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:51.880]   from the youth to the Sprouts, the plan is to open that up on October 18th to
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.320]   have physical meetings here. They're going to give a plan, an overview of
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.240]   layout and precautions that are being taken. More details will be given to you
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:03.480]   at our members meeting, which is October 11th, but just as a heads up, the plan is
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:08.040]   there and then it's going to kind of roll out in different increments, and if
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.080]   you have certain questions and things like that, please look out
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:15.240]   for more information to come. Let me take a moment to pray for us as we begin, and
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:20.360]   we'll move into time of giving offering. Let's pray. Our God, we want to thank you
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:25.760]   for your grace. Lord, we are so grateful to be able to come together to worship
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:30.500]   you because we know, God, that this is truly our great privilege to know you, to
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:35.480]   be known by you, and to give you praise. We're also so grateful that we are able
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:41.440]   to unite in our faith, essentially, Lord God, as your children, to be bound
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:46.000]   together by what we have in you, by what we have in our Lord, and so for all of
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.800]   that, we thank you, and I pray, God, that it would be from our hearts of
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:55.720]   gratitude, our hearts of thankfulness, where we will render to you everything,
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:01.000]   our thoughts, our affections, our love for you, Father. And God, even in our offering,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.600]   Lord, we desire to give to you with not reluctance, but God, just a gratitude, an
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.360]   overflow of appreciation for everything that you are doing in our lives. This day,
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:16.000]   Father God, from the singing to the preaching of your Word to the fellowship
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.640]   after, may all of that, God, be glorious to you and to exalt you, Lord. We want to
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.440]   thank you. It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.

[00:26:31.920 --> 00:27:00.420]   [music]
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.420]   Let us all rise as we sing these praises.
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:13.420]   [music]
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:14.420]   Come praise and glorify.
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:22.420]   Come praise and glorify our God, the Father of our Lord.
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:30.420]   In Christ He has an early rise, His blessings on us pour.
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:38.420]   For cure and blameless in His sight, He destined us to be.
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:46.420]   And now we've been adopted through His Son, eternal Lamb.
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.420]   To the praise.
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:52.420]   To the praise of Your glory.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:56.420]   To the praise of Your mercy and grace.
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:00.420]   To the praise of Your glory.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:05.420]   You are the God who saves.
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:09.420]   [music]
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:10.420]   Come praise and glorify.
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:18.420]   Come praise and glorify our God, who gives His grace in Christ.
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:26.420]   In Him our sins are washed away, redeemed through sacrifice.
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:34.420]   In Him God has been known to us, the mystery of His will.
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:42.420]   That Christ should be the head of all, His purpose to fulfill.
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:43.420]   To the praise.
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:47.420]   To the praise of Your glory.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:51.420]   To the praise of Your mercy and grace.
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:56.420]   To the praise of Your glory.
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:00.420]   You are the God who saves.
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:05.420]   [music]
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:06.420]   Come praise and glorify.
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:14.420]   Come praise and glorify our God, for we believe the Word.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:22.420]   And through our faith we have a seal, the Spirit of the Lord.
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:30.420]   The Spirit guarantees our hope until redemption's time.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:40.420]   Until we join in endless praise to God the King in one.
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.420]   To the praise of Your glory.
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:48.420]   To the praise of Your mercy and grace.
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:52.420]   To the praise of Your glory.
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:55.420]   You are the God who saves.
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:56.420]   To the praise.
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:00.420]   To the praise of Your glory.
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:04.420]   To the praise of Your mercy and grace.
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.420]   To the praise of Your glory.
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:12.420]   You are the God who saves.

[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:33.420]   [music]
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:41.420]   Jesus, I might cross that day.
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:48.420]   All to leave and follow Thee.
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:55.420]   Destined to despise, forsake.
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:31:02.420]   Thou from hence by all shall be.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:09.420]   Perish every fond ambition.
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:16.420]   All of sorrow, hope, or know.
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:23.420]   Yet our riches, mankind's dish.
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:32.420]   God and Him are still my own.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:36.420]   [music]
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:45.420]   Let the world, let the world despise and leave me.
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:52.420]   They have lost my Savior too.
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:59.420]   Humid hearts and lost deceit.
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:07.420]   Thou art not like that moon tree.
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:14.420]   Oh, well thou dost smile upon me.
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:21.420]   God of wisdom, loving, by me.
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:28.420]   Fools may hate and friends disown me.
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:37.420]   Show thy face and all is bright.
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.420]   [music]
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.420]   Golden earthly fame.
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:49.420]   Golden earthly fame it is.
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:56.420]   Come disasters, come it near.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:03.420]   In thy service, angels flourish.
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:10.420]   With thy favor, lost is gain.
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:17.420]   I have called thee, Alma Mater.
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:24.420]   I have stained my heart on thee.
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:31.420]   Storms may howl and clouds may gather.
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:40.420]   Alma, swear thy poor good to me.
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.420]   [music]
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:52.420]   So then know, so then know thy full salvation.
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:59.420]   Rise o'er sin and fear and care.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:06.420]   Joy to find in every station.
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:13.420]   Something still to do for them.
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:20.420]   Think what spirit dwells within thee.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:28.420]   Think what Father smiles on thy way.
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:35.420]   Think that Jesus dies you will be.
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:44.420]   Child of heaven, canst thou repent?
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:47.420]   [music]
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:50.420]   Haste thee on.
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:57.420]   Haste thee on from grace to glory.
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:04.420]   Armed by faith and winged by prayer.
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:11.420]   Heaven's eternal days before.
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:18.420]   God's own hand shall guide thee there.
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:25.420]   Soon shall close thy earthly vision.
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:32.420]   Soon shall pass thy golden days.
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:39.420]   All shall change to glad fruition.
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:46.420]   Faith to stop and prayer to praise.
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:55.420]   [music]
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.420]   May all be seated.
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:10.420]   Good morning again, everybody.
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.420]   Please take your Bibles and open up to Matthew chapter 5.
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:25.420]   And as we turn there, I just want to say just a word of thanks for all the volunteers,
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:29.420]   people in different service teams, helping out and making things happen.
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:36.420]   We've had a bunch of changes going outdoor, indoor, and then changing media things and stuff like that.
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.420]   I realize there's so many people involved in making things go.
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:43.420]   So I'm very grateful.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:49.420]   I'm also grateful because I realized I totally missed the session, the season of preaching outside.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:53.420]   Pastor Peter had to take the bulk of preaching in the hot sun.
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:57.420]   I got to be inside in the nice AC.
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:58.420]   I was like, "Oh, darn."
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.420]   He was like, "No, it was good."
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:11.420]   As we take a look at this passage, what I'd like to do first is read verse 38 down to verse 48.
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:20.420]   And I will be, for the sake of time, focusing on just that first paragraph from verse 38 through 42,
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.420]   and then highlight just an element of the next section.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:23.420]   Let me read for us.
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:29.420]   It says, "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.420]   But I say to you, do not resist an evil person.
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:36.420]   But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:41.420]   If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat also.
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:45.420]   Whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him too.
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:51.420]   Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you.
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:54.420]   You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:59.420]   But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:02.420]   so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven.
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:09.420]   For he causes his son to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:13.420]   For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:16.420]   Do not even the task collectors do the same?
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:20.420]   If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others?
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.420]   Do not even the Gentiles do the same?
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:26.420]   Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:28.420]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:36.420]   Our God, we really do ask for your Spirit to move through your Word and convict our hearts.
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:40.420]   We recognize, Lord, that your truth is so powerful.
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:44.420]   And God, oftentimes your truth also is repetitive in your Word.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.420]   But sometimes, God, we are hard of hearing.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.420]   Sometimes we're forgetful.
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:52.420]   And sometimes, Lord, our hearts resist your Word.
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:57.420]   But I pray that, God, you would soften us, you would teach us, Lord, and we would humbly receive.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:00.420]   It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:04.420]   As we take a look at this passage, the context of Matthew chapter 5,
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:11.420]   if you take a look, just kind of skim with me for a brief second to just get the context here.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.420]   You know, this is that famous Sermon on the Mount in chapter 5.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:21.420]   And then in chapter 5, verses 1 through 12, you have the section that is famously known as the Beatitudes.
[00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:26.420]   So if you look at your Bibles, you'll have this long list of "Blessed are those, blessed are those."
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.420]   And what we see is Jesus teaching an incredible sermon,
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:36.420]   defining for us and telling us who is actually truly blessed.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:39.420]   Who is truly blessed of God.
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:42.420]   And it is so contrary to what is the norm.
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.420]   It is contrary to what we believe.
[00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:49.420]   It is contrary to what is societal expectations and standards.
[00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:53.420]   Because society believes those are truly blessed who are educated.
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.420]   Those are truly blessed who have skill.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:00.420]   Those are truly blessed who are rich and have resources in their lives.
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:04.420]   Here, Jesus is telling them, "No, blessed are those who are able to mourn over sin.
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:08.420]   Blessed are those who are poor in spirit, and blessed are those who are able to make peace."
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:10.420]   And so on. Right?
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:19.420]   So what we have, as I'm emphasizing, is a massive contrast between what people are perceiving versus what reality is.
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.420]   And he continues to do that.
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:28.420]   If you take a look at verses 13 and down, he talks about how the disciples should be salt and light of the earth.
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:34.420]   He is giving an expectation that is breaking what is normative.
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:38.420]   And I'm repeating that because he's going to continue to do that through the entire chapter.
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:44.420]   The normative way we sometimes think about life, and sometimes, again, in good intention,
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:51.420]   when non-Christians try to teach us, they tell you, "Don't be strange. Don't be weird."
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:54.420]   Because that ruins your chances of excelling in life.
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:41:03.420]   As a matter of fact, if you had it your way, the best thing to do is work the system, be a leader, and come out on top in this world.
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:07.420]   God says, "No. You're to be radically different. You're to be salty.
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:12.420]   You're supposed to shine as so different from what is normative in this life."
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:19.420]   And so, likewise, continuing on that theme of compare and contrast, Christ highlights these things.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.420]   You thought you knew.
[00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:26.420]   You thought you had the Old Testament law, and you thought you had an understanding.
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:28.420]   But let me tell you what is real.
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.420]   What is real godliness.
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:32.420]   What is true spirituality.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.420]   What is actually in the nature of God.
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:42.420]   One example of that, the first one, he says in verse 21, Matthew 5, 21, he says,
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:49.420]   "You have heard that the ancients were told, 'You shall not commit murder, and whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.'
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:55.420]   But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court.
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:42:01.420]   And whoever says to his brother, 'You good-for-nothing,' shall be guilty before the supreme court.
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:08.420]   And whoever says, 'You fool,' shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell."
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.420]   Wow.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:15.420]   If you think about it in contrast, on an external superficial level,
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:20.420]   if you just say, "On this boundary, do not murder," the vast majority of us will say,
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:25.420]   "Good, I'm done with that one because I am not killing anybody these days."
[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:28.420]   But Christ says, "You think you knew what God was trying to get at.
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:31.420]   You think you knew what it meant to be righteous.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:35.420]   And those Pharisees, the religious looters, they think they're setting the bar.
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:40.420]   Let me radically challenge the normative that you think is acceptable."
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:45.420]   And what he does is he points to the internal heart and says, "But you have anger in your heart.
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:49.420]   You have this arrogance in your heart.
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:53.420]   You have this viciousness in your heart where you're willing to call somebody good-for-nothing.
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:55.420]   You fool."
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:59.420]   I don't want to do a mini-sermon in a sermon, but that alone is so convicting, right?
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:05.420]   How many times have we in recent days watched articles, heard the news, saw what people were doing,
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:09.420]   and you just felt this rage in your heart?
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:12.420]   Jesus is pointing that out.
[00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.420]   Jesus is highlighting all of that.
[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:19.420]   And so what I like to say is the passage that we're coming to is this compare and contrast of,
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.420]   "You think you know.
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:24.420]   Yes, you have the Old Testament.
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:28.420]   But maybe in terms of the normative that you thought was acceptable,
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:32.420]   let me teach you what God expects in terms of the internal heart.
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:36.420]   The transformation of the insides, both your perspective, your attitude, your desires,
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:44.420]   and all the stuff that's the working of your insides, God wants to radically transform to purify."
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:52.420]   And so my proposition and the main thrust of the sermon is going to be to transform a particular element,
[00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:56.420]   which is the heart of retaliation, through the grace of God.
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:02.420]   To transform the heart of retaliation through the grace of God.
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:11.420]   Just from the overview reading of the passage, you saw that Christ was tackling a heavy element,
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:16.420]   a specific area of sin in the life of the disciples.
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:20.420]   And what he says—I'm going to present this as a command—
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:25.420]   the first point I want to highlight is to correct what you thought you knew about the law.
[00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:29.420]   Correct what you thought you knew about the law.
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:32.420]   When you take a look at this passage, Matthew 5:38, he says,
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:38.420]   "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'"
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:44.420]   And what he's doing is he is highlighting and pinpointing something that is commonly rehearsed,
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:48.420]   reiterated, quoted within the community,
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:52.420]   and he tackles that as, "You think you understand, but let me tell you what's up."
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:58.420]   Now, this specific verse, you recognize it is a direct quotation from the Old Testament.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:04.420]   It comes from Exodus 21, verse 23-25. I'll read it for us, and it says this,
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:07.420]   "But if there is any further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty,
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:10.420]   life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, and hand for hand.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:17.420]   Foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise."
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:22.420]   Now, this law God gave to the people, essentially to govern the people.
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:27.420]   He gave to Moses as a civil law, not as necessarily how you're supposed to treat each other one-to-one,
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:30.420]   but as a civil law to govern the people.
[00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:37.420]   And in other cultures, other historical nations and governments, this law exists to this day, right?
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:39.420]   In Latin, it's called "lex talionis."
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:43.420]   And essentially, they quote, "Eye for eye," and the thought there is,
[00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:49.420]   when there is injury, the consequence and penalty should be of equal value, right?
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:51.420]   And essentially, that's what exists.
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:56.420]   But we have to ask this question, why did God give this law to the people?
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.420]   Well, the first answer is very obvious and clear,
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:03.420]   it is because God himself is a fair God who is a God of law and order.
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.420]   God himself is a God of justice.
[00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:12.420]   God himself is a God where the punishment is of appropriateness.
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:17.420]   He is not a Greek God who's on a whim, who happens to react impulsively.
[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:22.420]   And should you just catch him on a bad day, he ends up just eradicating everybody.
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:27.420]   Now, someone might say, "But hasn't God in the Old Testament,
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:31.420]   hasn't he eradicated many people?"
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:38.420]   Even immediately after Moses receives the law, didn't he split open the ground and cause people to die?
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:42.420]   What I'm going to say is, every judgment in the Old Testament that you see,
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:47.420]   no matter how severe you think it is, was always appropriate.
[00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:54.420]   Because sin against the holy God, sin against the almighty, it is devastating.
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:59.420]   We even recognize degrees of punishment based on who we sin against.
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:02.420]   It is different when you sin against somebody who happens to be your friend.
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:07.420]   It is different if you transgress an American law against a president or a sitting official.
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:08.420]   There's difference of penalty.
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:13.420]   I'm just saying that to say, the reason why God gives this law that there should be equal
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:17.420]   and appropriate kind of punishment, even amongst person to person,
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:20.420]   is because God himself is always just and fair.
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:23.420]   Okay? That is his nature.
[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:31.420]   Now, I think what's more obvious is he gave this law because people needed it.
[00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:33.420]   There is such a propensity.
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:36.420]   There is such a habit in the heart of man.
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:41.420]   When you feel like you've been hurt, you've been dishonored, disrespected,
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:45.420]   you've been attacked, to just come out with this retaliation,
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:50.420]   "Oh, really? You're going to feel the full force of my wrath!"
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:56.420]   Right? Like, retaliation is so like a knee-jerk reaction in the sinful heart.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:04.420]   And what I'm going to say then is the scriptures teach us that this law was given to restrain our sin.
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:07.420]   Take a look at a passage in Deuteronomy chapter 19.
[00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:11.420]   We recognize that this command was given in multiple contexts.
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:13.420]   It was given early on in the book of Exodus.
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:16.420]   It was also given later on in the second Deuteronomy, right?
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:19.420]   With the people in the wilderness.
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:24.420]   Before they went into the land of Cana, after 40 years, they have reiteration of this law.
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:29.420]   And what he says is in verse 18, this is Deuteronomy 19, verse 18.
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:37.420]   "The judges shall investigate thoroughly, and if the witness is a false witness, and he accused his brother falsely,
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:41.420]   then you shall do to him just as he has intended to do to his brother."
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:45.420]   And then look what he says. "Thus you shall purge the evil from among you."
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:49.420]   What God was desiring was to prevent more wickedness.
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:55.420]   God designed to govern the people that there would be a cap on this stacking up of hitting each other,
[00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:58.420]   hurting each other, and ultimately destroying each other.
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:01.420]   But you notice what is the bent of the human heart.
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:04.420]   And I'm highlighting this because when there is a law given,
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:10.420]   it is not because God happened to be this exacting, mean God of the Old Testament.
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:13.420]   There are people, Christians, who actually write that in commentaries.
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:16.420]   That God had this exacting nature to him.
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.420]   God has this exacting nature even to this day.
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:24.420]   He says in the New Testament, "Not even a single careless word will go unpunished."
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:28.420]   What it is, is actually God restraining more sin.
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:32.420]   And the problem is, God gives good laws, and the people are so sinful,
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:35.420]   that when they're hurt, they exaggerate.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.420]   Why do you think there is this case?
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:40.420]   You know when a brother gives false testimony?
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.420]   You know it's false testimony?
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.420]   Someone hurts you, and you're like, "That guy, he has it out for me.
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:48.420]   He wants to kill me. He wants to get rid of me.
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:52.420]   I think he actually made a mistake." Right?
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:57.420]   Exaggeration is a false testimony, and we do it all the time.
[00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:01.420]   Why? Because our hearts retaliate.
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:06.420]   When we feel offended, we have this knee-jerk reaction to want to hurt back.
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:10.420]   To make sure, like, "Don't you dare ever do this to me!"
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:12.420]   And that's what we're talking about.
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:15.420]   But what I like to highlight is, in summary, like,
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:20.420]   God's law, even here in the Old Testament, both Exodus, Deuteronomy,
[00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:24.420]   it comes from His governing grace. Amen?
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:28.420]   I want to highlight that, because sometimes people have this weird false dichotomy.
[00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:32.420]   Anything that reeks of, like, harsh judgment, consequences for sin,
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:35.420]   is like, "God is so OT," like Old Testament.
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:40.420]   No, no, no, no. This is God's mercy on the people to cap and restrain them.
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.420]   You need this.
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:46.420]   And the law regularly shows us, "It's you!" Right?
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:48.420]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:52.420]   But historically, then, when God gives good laws,
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:55.420]   how did people understand it? How did people take it?
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:58.420]   And this is where I want to find conviction, is because I realize,
[00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:01.420]   this is in us. This is in me.
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:05.420]   As I read this passage and asked the question, "Why does God give these laws?"
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:08.420]   and "How do people receive them?"
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:10.420]   And when Jesus says, "You have heard,"
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:13.420]   He is not only highlighting the fact that it was written in the Old Testament,
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.420]   but He's highlighting your perception of it.
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.420]   This is your normative.
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:20.420]   This is what you think is acceptable.
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:24.420]   This is what you thought was the command of God.
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.420]   How did people take it?
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:32.420]   I think what's clear is people take it as though the law of God gave them a right.
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:35.420]   Let me explain what I mean by that.
[00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:37.420]   The law of God says, "Eye for an eye."
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:41.420]   And He says, basically, "You shall not inflict excessive penalty."
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:44.420]   It's in the American law, Eighth Amendment, right?
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:47.420]   There will not be a cruel and unusual punishment,
[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:52.420]   and you shall not induce a cruel, overreaching penalty,
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:55.420]   whether for parole or whatever it may be.
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:57.420]   You shall not do that, right?
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:00.420]   But rather than thinking of it as a cap to restrain them,
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:04.420]   they thought of it as, "I have a right to make sure you know
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:07.420]   you never, ever treat me like that."
[00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.420]   "I have a right. If you're going to treat me like that,
[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:13.420]   then I get to treat you like that. Eye for an eye."
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:18.420]   It became a right and excuse to enact it.
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:20.420]   You see what I'm talking about there?
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:23.420]   And so in that way, I would like to move to my second point.
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:28.420]   In order to have this transforming of the inner heart of retaliation,
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:32.420]   we have to repent of that inner desire.
[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:34.420]   And the way I'd like to make sense of it to you,
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:36.420]   I'm going to rephrase my second point,
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:39.420]   is repent of the little gangster in your heart.
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:40.420]   Okay?
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:42.420]   We all have the little gangster in our heart.
[00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:44.420]   Some of you guys know my background.
[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:47.420]   When I was in high school, I thought it was so cool to be in a gang,
[00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:48.420]   and so I joined the gang.
[00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:51.420]   And we thought we were so tough, and we thought we were so hard.
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:53.420]   And all the guys, they had this mentality.
[00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:56.420]   It's like, "If you even look at me, you're going to get it."
[00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.420]   Come on, we all have that little gangster voice.
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:01.420]   It even has a little accent. It's like, "No, dog."
[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:03.420]   And some of you even snap your fingers.
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:08.420]   You have the thing you do with your head when you bob and you're mad inside.
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:11.420]   And some of you guys, laughing hard, that's not really an internal thing.
[00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:13.420]   It comes out outside too, right?
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:17.420]   You kind of change your voice when you get into this mode where you say,
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:21.420]   "No! If you hurt me, I'm going to hurt you back."
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:23.420]   Right?
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:27.420]   Where your heart says, "You hurt me? It's my turn."
[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:29.420]   That exists, and we recognize it.
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:30.420]   And I want to say this.
[00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:33.420]   There is a perversion of the logic of the law.
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:37.420]   There is a perversion where the law of "I for an I"
[00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:39.420]   was given as a consistent standard of God,
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:43.420]   and it is appropriate for us to uphold the consistent standard of God
[00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:46.420]   versus you want to uphold you.
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:48.420]   You want to avenge you.
[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:55.420]   You want to make sure that you are the judge, jury, and executioner.
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:58.420]   "You better respect me. You better recognize."
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:02.420]   The gangster comes out of you, and it speaks like that.
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:05.420]   And that part of it needs to be repented of.
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:09.420]   There's a passage in Leviticus 24.
[00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:11.420]   Turn in your Bibles there.
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:13.420]   Leviticus 24, verse 19.
[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:17.420]   It shows to us the rationale behind this law.
[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:21.420]   And he says, "If a man injures his neighbor, just as he has done,
[00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:23.420]   so it shall be done to him.
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:26.420]   Fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth,
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:31.420]   just as he has injured a man, so it shall be inflicted on him.
[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:34.420]   Thus the one who kills an animal shall make it good,
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:37.420]   and the one who kills a man shall be put to death.
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:40.420]   There shall be one standard for you.
[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:42.420]   It shall be for the stranger as well as the native,
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:45.420]   for I am the Lord your God."
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:51.420]   He wanted that standard because of his objective righteousness.
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:53.420]   And he's not a respecter of people.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:56.420]   He doesn't have this, you know, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da,
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:58.420]   this is on this day, that day.
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:01.420]   He wants an objective standard, and we as Christians have to uphold it.
[00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:08.420]   What's false and erroneous is we twist that as a justification for my vengeance.
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:10.420]   To avenge me.
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:14.420]   But who's going to make sure he knows how much he hurt me?
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:18.420]   Who's going to make sure that he actually respects me, right?
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:25.420]   And that is two entirely different things, but sometimes so, so muddied.
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:27.420]   Now, as I want to give examples of this,
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:30.420]   there's a clear example of retaliation in Scripture.
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:32.420]   Turn your Bibles to Genesis chapter 4.
[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:38.420]   So early on in the history of man, there was a sinfulness already ingrained into his heart.
[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:41.420]   Genesis chapter 4 verse 23, it says this,
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:46.420]   "Lamech said to his wives, 'Ada and Zillah, listen to my voice.
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:50.420]   You wives of Lamech, give heed to my speech,
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:54.420]   for I have killed a man for wounding me, a boy for striking me.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:56:00.420]   If Cain is avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.'"
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:04.420]   I presume if the secular world read this, they would think,
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:09.420]   "Oh man, that guy's a gangster. You don't mess with him."
[00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:16.420]   But the weird thing is, that heart, he's bragging about how in his arrogance,
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:19.420]   no one's going to mess with him.
[00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:21.420]   He wants them to hear about it.
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:24.420]   "You don't mess with me, because I'm a gangster."
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:27.420]   I don't want to overdo it, but that part's in there.
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:29.420]   And let me give you an example of case scenarios.
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:31.420]   I mean, it comes up in everywhere.
[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:36.420]   On the court, I confess to you, there have been times, you play basketball,
[00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:38.420]   some guy does a dirty move, and all of a sudden,
[00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:42.420]   your gangster voice comes out, and like, "Oh, we're going to play like that, huh?"
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:44.420]   "You're going to play dirty?"
[00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:48.420]   And you almost want to retaliate, like, "Now it's my turn."
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:51.420]   In the car, someone cuts you off.
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:55.420]   I mean, road rage is like a classic example of retaliation.
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:57.420]   You want to make sure, it's like, "Oh, you want to know how it feels?
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:56:59.420]   You drive all fast, go in front of the person?"
[00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:01.420]   Of course, I've never done that.
[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:04.420]   But in the car, do you ever start screaming?
[00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:09.420]   "You need to get off the road! You don't deserve to drive!"
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:12.420]   Does it happen in marriages?
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:16.420]   It's like, "Oh, you can talk to me like that, with no restraint?"
[00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:21.420]   "You want to know how angry I can be? You want to see me mad?"
[00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:24.420]   It happens in marriages, relationships.
[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:27.420]   It happens in so many different scenarios.
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:30.420]   And that all to say, again, it's sometimes so deceptive.
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:31.420]   The heart is deceptive.
[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:35.420]   We think that doing that is the right thing to do.
[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:42.420]   We think doing that is actually the right way to make sure this sin is dealt with.
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:48.420]   No. This passage is so convicting because it tackles, again,
[00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:53.420]   your preconceived notion of what is normative for the righteous person.
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:55.420]   "Yeah, I for an I."
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:58.420]   And what Jesus does is point very directly into the heart and says,
[00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:02.420]   "Your insides, that needs to be transformed."
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:09.420]   So, I move now to point number three, where Jesus commands.
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:13.420]   Jesus instructs, and as a summary of what He instructs us to do,
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:17.420]   He instructs us to give even more and more.
[00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:22.420]   Excuse me.
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:25.420]   He instructs us to give even more and more.
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:28.420]   Let's take a look at the passage once more.
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:31.420]   He says, after saying, "You have heard,"
[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:35.420]   Verse 39, "Do not resist an evil person,
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:39.420]   but whoever slaps you on your cheek, turn the other to him also.
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:42.420]   If anyone wants to sue you, take and take your shirt.
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:44.420]   Let him have your coat also.
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:49.420]   Whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him too.
[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:54.420]   Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you."
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:56.420]   Wow.
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:58.420]   If you take a moment to not read that as just like,
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:01.420]   "Yeah, these are just lofty things," Jesus says, right?
[00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:03.420]   Would you meditate on that?
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:05.420]   It should cause you to be like, "Wait, wait, what?
[00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:11.420]   Did you say the evil person?"
[00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:16.420]   You know what makes it so hard sometimes to hold your tongue is when you see wickedness.
[00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:17.420]   Right?
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:22.420]   And then part of you--I'm almost trying to share with you my personal reaction
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:24.420]   when I was working through this passage in my devotions.
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:26.420]   I had weird reactions.
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:30.420]   Initially, I was like, "Oh, yeah, you just got to read the context because there's got to be more than that."
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:31.420]   Right?
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:33.420]   He's got to be qualified.
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:35.420]   There's got to be some caveats here, right?
[00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:38.420]   And then you read him say like, "Even to the evil person."
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:42.420]   And then you start thinking of the other passages like, "No, Scripture says expose them.
[00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:44.420]   Scripture says to not walk with them."
[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:49.420]   Well, clearly, yes, Jesus is not telling you to condone the evil man.
[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:54.420]   But what he's telling you is to not resist with retaliation,
[00:59:54.420 --> 01:00:00.420]   and what's more, to give generously.
[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:04.420]   And part of me just reacted with like a, "This can't be."
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:07.420]   I'm not sure if ever you guys have had that moment.
[01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:12.420]   You're reading the Scriptures and you're like, "Huh? It doesn't make sense."
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:15.420]   Of course we're going to stand against the evil person.
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.420]   Of course I'm going to defend myself.
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:22.420]   Of course if he falsely accuses me, I'm going to give a defense.
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:24.420]   And again, I want to challenge you.
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:27.420]   Jesus is going to regularly ask us,
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:30.420]   "Are you going to do exactly what everybody else does?
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:32.420]   How then are you any different?
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:34.420]   Are you going to say the exact same thing?
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:37.420]   Are you going to do the exact same thing?
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:40.420]   How much do you have to give?"
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:43.420]   And so I want to walk through this a little bit because he says,
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:47.420]   "If you are slapped and someone slaps you on your..."
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:52.420]   It's interesting, right, that he actually specifies on the right side of your cheek.
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:56.420]   But I want you to think about that because you know, I mean,
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.420]   even when me and my brother, when we were young and we were fighting,
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:01.420]   we just knew, "You don't touch the face."
[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:03.420]   We could punch each other all we want. We could wrestle.
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:05.420]   We could do all kinds of crazy stuff, but you don't touch the face.
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:09.420]   Why? Because absolutely disrespectful.
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:15.420]   And what Jesus is doing is he's highlighting one of the elements that to us is so difficult
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:21.420]   to just hold our tongue, to just not retaliate, is in the moment of disrespect.
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:25.420]   And there's part of it that's going to be like, "Don't we have a right to that?
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:28.420]   Don't we have a right to dignity? Don't we have a right?
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:30.420]   I should be respected.
[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:33.420]   If you're a father, I should be respected in this home.
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:36.420]   If you're a boss, I should be respected in this job." Right?
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:39.420]   We feel like we have that right.
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:44.420]   There's more. He says, "If someone wants to sue you and take your shirt,"
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:47.420]   it's also very interesting that he describes the difference between taking your shirt
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:49.420]   and then taking your cloak.
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:53.420]   And you guys have heard probably that this idea of the cloak.
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:56.420]   A lot of people at that time, they just had one.
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:58.420]   That's all they had.
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:03.420]   So to a worker, Jesus says, "If you have one of his possessions as some kind of collateral,
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:05.420]   make sure you give it back to him by the end of the day."
[01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:08.420]   Why? Because he has nothing else.
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.420]   And then he says, "Give it to him."
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:14.420]   I'm like, "What?"
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:17.420]   Our natural tendency, if you're sued and accused,
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:19.420]   you're going to have this tendency to be like, "What?
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:22.420]   I have a right to be defended against stuff like that.
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:26.420]   I have a right to not be falsely accused of stuff." Yes?
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:31.420]   And it would be to you this feeling of right to protection and security.
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:36.420]   And then he goes on and says, "Whoever forces you to go one mile,
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.420]   go with him two."
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.420]   I'm like, "What? Mind-blowing stuff."
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:42.420]   Back then, there were Roman soldiers.
[01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:45.420]   Legally, Roman soldiers could grab all the material,
[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:49.420]   give it to a civilian, say, "I'm going to take my stuff and walk."
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:51.420]   "Carry the burden, you donkey."
[01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:53.420]   That's pretty much what it was.
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:56.420]   And so you can imagine the civilians, they hated Roman soldiers.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.420]   It's like, "Oh my goodness, these people.
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:03.420]   Making me carry all their junk."
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:06.420]   He says to them, "Go with him the extra mile."
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:10.420]   And that's where we get with proverbial statements, "Go the extra mile."
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:15.420]   Question, how much do you have to give in you?
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:19.420]   Because what Jesus is doing is he's highlighting for the kingdom citizen,
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:24.420]   for the sons of God, sons and daughters,
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:28.420]   you should have through your relationship with God this wealth.
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:32.420]   That yes, even in the midst of persecution, even in the midst of suffering,
[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:36.420]   we many times, we find ourselves, we're the ones in need.
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:39.420]   I'm in suffering. I need help.
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:42.420]   But you're taking from me?
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:45.420]   Jesus is going to call out and say, "Even in those moments,
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:50.420]   through the gospel, through Christ and the completeness that we have in him,
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:52.420]   how much do you have to give?"
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:58.420]   And lastly, he says, "If someone asks you, do not turn him away."
[01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:01.420]   You know, some of the most annoying things in life
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:05.420]   are people who are prideful and people who are free birds.
[01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:08.420]   If you've ever had that guy in your life, the friend in your life,
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:11.420]   who's just always like, "Can you spot me here? Can you spot me there?"
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:14.420]   It's like, "Wait a minute. You have all this stuff.
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:17.420]   Why are you asking me for stuff when you have it?"
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:21.420]   Now, I am not saying that no matter what the circumstances are,
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:25.420]   just give, just give, give, give, give, give, because that is not true.
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:29.420]   But clearly, we understand Jesus' command here.
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:32.420]   He is telling us that, yes, you may have your right,
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:35.420]   but if you are going to say, "I have this right, and therefore,
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:40.420]   I'm going to exercise my right, and never, ever will you take advantage of me."
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:42.420]   He's asking you.
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:46.420]   It sounds to me like then all you have is your life in this world.
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:49.420]   Don't you have more to give as a Christian?
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:52.420]   As a kingdom citizen, don't you have more to give?
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:55.420]   Take a look at Apostle Paul's attitude and mentality here.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:58.420]   1 Corinthians 9. Please turn in your Bibles there.
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:01.420]   1 Corinthians 9.
[01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:04.420]   And he asked these questions.
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:07.420]   He says, "Am I not free?
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:09.420]   Am I not an apostle?
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:11.420]   Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:13.420]   Are you not my work in the Lord?
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:18.420]   If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you,
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.420]   for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:24.420]   My defense to those who examine me is this.
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:27.420]   Do we not have a right to eat and drink?
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:30.420]   Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife,
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:34.420]   even as the rest of the apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:38.420]   Or do only Barnabas and I not have the right to refrain from working?
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:43.420]   Who at any time serves as a soldier at his own expense?"
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:45.420]   See what he's talking about there?
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.420]   Turn in your eyes to verse 12, and he says,
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:50.420]   "If others share the right over you, do we not more?
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:54.420]   Nevertheless, we did not use this right,
[01:05:54.420 --> 01:06:01.420]   but we endure all things so that we will cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ."
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.420]   Yeah.
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.420]   You know what's normal?
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.420]   I got a right to be here.
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:08.420]   I got a right for you to respect me.
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:11.420]   I've got a right for protections.
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.420]   Eye for an eye.
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:15.420]   And Jesus is going to say,
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:17.420]   "As a kingdom citizen,
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:20.420]   we regularly lay down our rights.
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:22.420]   We regularly hold our tongue,
[01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:24.420]   even in the midst of persecution.
[01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:29.420]   And we know Jesus Christ set this model for us to follow."
[01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:34.420]   Turn in your Bible to 1 Peter 2, verse 21 through 24.
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:37.420]   Such an important passage for this topic.
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:39.420]   He says this,
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:42.420]   "For you have been called for this purpose,
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:45.420]   since Christ also suffered for you,
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:48.420]   and He gave you an example for you to follow in His steps,
[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:51.420]   who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in His mouth.
[01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:54.420]   And while being reviled, He did not revile in return.
[01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:56.420]   While suffering, He uttered no threats,
[01:06:56.420 --> 01:07:00.420]   but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously.
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:04.420]   And He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross,
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:07.420]   so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.
[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:11.420]   For by His wounds you have been healed."
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:15.420]   The rationale and logic of the world, it makes sense to retell it.
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:18.420]   The rationale and logic of the gospel says,
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:21.420]   "You must have already died to this world, died to yourself,
[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:26.420]   and you must be rich in the spiritual blessings of Christ
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:30.420]   to be able to be reviled,
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:34.420]   to be stretched and whipped,
[01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:37.420]   and yet not revile in return."
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:40.420]   Now, I would like to say this, moving to point number four.
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:44.420]   We recognize that Jesus is commanding us to give, give, and give,
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:47.420]   just like He has modeled, just as He has shown us.
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:50.420]   But I want to make sure that we understand that we have to,
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:55.420]   in this way, uphold the righteousness of God.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:58.420]   Because some people misinterpreted this passage.
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:02.420]   Some people have this misunderstanding to be eye for an eye,
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:06.420]   to be tooth for tooth, is all Old Testament,
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:09.420]   like, exacting punishment stuff.
[01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:14.420]   But to be a New Testament believer, gracious, you don't do this.
[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:18.420]   And some people actually use this ideology to say we should be pacifists.
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:21.420]   Some people use this ideology and they get kind of scared.
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:25.420]   Somebody commits a sin and you're like, "Well, what do we do? We just got to forgive."
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:30.420]   No, no, no. We uphold the righteousness of God.
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:38.420]   You see, what we understood was that God gave the Old Testament to purge sin.
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:42.420]   But what's happening is in our sinfulness, we just stack sin for sin.
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:43.420]   So what does Scripture say?
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:48.420]   Regularly, you commit evil in the face of evil.
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:50.420]   Sin breeds more sin.
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:55.420]   Their evil now inspires your evil, and all you're doing is saying, "My turn for evil."
[01:08:55.420 --> 01:09:01.420]   And what God is saying to us is, "Do not repay evil for evil."
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:06.420]   But rather, accomplish the righteousness of God by giving good,
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:09.420]   by giving grace, by giving love.
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:12.420]   You see, we're not trying to mimic this passage.
[01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:15.420]   Some people are like, "Oh yeah, maybe this is kind of in line with the stuff of Gandhi.
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:19.420]   This is in line with the stuff of the passive resistance stuff."
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:22.420]   No, it is not. This is very, very different.
[01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:26.420]   We absolutely uphold the justice and standard of God
[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:29.420]   because every institution has been given by God to do so.
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:35.420]   Governments, churches, families, parents, all of these institutions
[01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:40.420]   have been given a stewardship of authority, and they must enact justice.
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:45.420]   And consequences must be given for breaking of the law.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:50.420]   However, for us on a personal level, what we are doing
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:55.420]   is accomplishing the righteousness of God by our character in this.
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:10:00.420]   So turn your Bibles over to Romans chapter 12, verse 16 through 21,
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:03.420]   and look at what he says.
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:06.420]   He says, "Be of the same mind toward one another.
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:09.420]   Do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly.
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:12.420]   Do not be wise in your own estimation.
[01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:15.420]   Never pay back evil for evil to anyone."
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:19.420]   And then he says this, "Respect what is right in the sight of all men."
[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:23.420]   See? But what's more, it says, "If possible, so far it depends on you.
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:26.420]   Be at peace with all men. Never take your own revenge, beloved,
[01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:29.420]   but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written,
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:33.420]   'Vengeance is mine; I will repay,' says the Lord.
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:36.420]   But if your enemy is hungry, feed him.
[01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:39.420]   If he is thirsty, give him a drink, for in so doing,
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:42.420]   you will keep burning coals on his head.
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:48.420]   Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:53.420]   The challenge for us is to actually garner greater righteousness.
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:58.420]   Do not be so weak as to have your senses elicited
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:02.420]   that when evil is done for you, it becomes a temptation.
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:05.420]   "Me too." No, no, no, no, no.
[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:08.420]   For us, God is calling us to recognize in wisdom
[01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:13.420]   every sin and transgression is going to be judged.
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:17.420]   Either already on the cross through the sacrifice of Christ,
[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:20.420]   it will be judged thoroughly, or in hell,
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:24.420]   where God's wrath will be enacted, it will be judged thoroughly.
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.420]   You understand that.
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:31.420]   And so knowing that, you can have this kind of paradoxical understanding.
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:38.420]   I uphold the righteousness of God, but I need not retaliate to vindicate myself.
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:41.420]   But rather, I have this opportunity to give grace.
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:44.420]   Rather, I have this opportunity to show love.
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:48.420]   Rather, I have this opportunity to be like God.
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:50.420]   And so this is my next point.
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:53.420]   What the Lord is doing in this passage,
[01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:58.420]   yes, He is giving you parameters, and He is doing this surgical number.
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:01.420]   "Oh, you think you have the right to protection?
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:03.420]   You think you have the right to respect?
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:05.420]   You! You think this is your norm?"
[01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:07.420]   And then He corrects all that stuff, right?
[01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:11.420]   But what He's also doing is He's giving these commands so that we would be.
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:13.420]   And so this is what He says.
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:17.420]   Take a look at Matthew 5 now, verse 43,
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:20.420]   and until the rest of that paragraph, verse 48.
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:23.420]   And He says, "You have heard that it was said,
[01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:26.420]   'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:30.420]   But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:33.420]   so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven.
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:36.420]   For He causes His Son to rise on the evil and the good,
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:39.420]   and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:43.420]   For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:46.420]   Do not even tax collectors do the same?
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:50.420]   If you greet only your brothers, then what more are you doing than others?
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:53.420]   Do not even the Gentiles do the same?
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:59.420]   Therefore, you are to be perfect, as your Heavenly Father is perfect."
[01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:01.420]   Brothers and sisters, earlier I said,
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:04.420]   when I was reading this passage and kind of meditating,
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:06.420]   my reactions were varied.
[01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:09.420]   Initially it was like, "Whoa, these are extreme statements."
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:12.420]   And then there was this, "Well, there's got to be exceptions, you know?
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:15.420]   These aren't absolute statements." And that's true.
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:19.420]   Because this doesn't mean that everything wrong, just be like,
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:21.420]   "Oh well, what can you do?"
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:24.420]   That is not what God is saying, at all, right?
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:28.420]   People should obey laws. There should be justice, okay?
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:34.420]   But my other reaction was, "I don't know how to apply this."
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:38.420]   Have you guys ever read the Scriptures and just felt like that?
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:43.420]   You almost have this malfunction in my brain.
[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:45.420]   And you want to ask God, like,
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:49.420]   "Lord, I think you're going to need to give greater parameters, more instructions."
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:51.420]   And some of you guys, your mind is geared like that.
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:55.420]   It's like, "Wait a minute. Maybe you guys are like the engineers.
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:57.420]   You need the written code."
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:59.420]   And you're like, "I just need to follow the lines.
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:01.420]   What am I supposed to do then?
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:04.420]   What if there's a guy who's just selfish and he's asking me stuff?
[01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:07.420]   Do I give now? Do I not give? What do you do?"
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:11.420]   And some of the stuff, yeah, when he even brings it up,
[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:14.420]   it's not like, "Is that sin?"
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:18.420]   If someone sues me because they think I did something wrong,
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.420]   do you see what I'm saying?
[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:23.420]   And I almost have this malfunction in my head.
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:26.420]   I'm like, "Wait a minute. You've got to give me more.
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:29.420]   God, why are you not as clear as can be here, right?
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:32.420]   You've got to give me more parameters."
[01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:34.420]   But I want to give you a challenge.
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:38.420]   And this is something I realize. This is just my immaturity.
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:41.420]   When God is giving us these commands,
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:44.420]   He is not trying to give you the minutiae
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:48.420]   so that all you have to do is do a logical mind flow,
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:51.420]   a logical standard operating procedure
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:55.420]   so that you can go, "Oh, if A then B, then I can go here."
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:57.420]   Do you understand what He says?
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:15:01.420]   Imitate your Father. Be like Him.
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:05.420]   And for those of you guys who have had parents who are wise and godly,
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:08.420]   so when it was time to be compassionate for those who are weak,
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:12.420]   they were so meek and compassionate, and they were humble in heart.
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:15.420]   But when it came down to make sure that they laid down the law,
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:17.420]   and they were strict, and they made sure that people knew,
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:21.420]   "You can't do this stuff underneath our house because that's sin."
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:24.420]   And you looked at them, and you realized, "Oh my goodness, there's wisdom in that.
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:27.420]   There's part of you that wishes there was a manual book for that."
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:33.420]   But more so what you're doing is you're trying to emulate your wise Father.
[01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:37.420]   If you had that in your life, blessed, you're blessed.
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:42.420]   If you didn't have that in your life, you have the Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:46.420]   So strong, He knew the heart of men.
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:50.420]   So strong that He would not back down.
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:52.420]   So strong He spoke with authority.
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:55.420]   So strong He silenced people.
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:59.420]   So strong He took a court of whips and chased the marketeers, right,
[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:02.420]   the money makers from the temple.
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:06.420]   And yet so humble.
[01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:08.420]   Talk about dignity.
[01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:10.420]   Talk about slapping in the face.
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:13.420]   Have you ever thought about being spit on in the face
[01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:20.420]   when you are the Lord of the universe and not saying anything back?
[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:23.420]   Think about being forced, being forced to carry a beam,
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:26.420]   being forced to be stretched out then whipped.
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:29.420]   People asking you, "Why don't you do this, Jesus?
[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:30.420]   Why don't you throw yourself down?
[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:31.420]   Why don't you do this, Jesus?
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.420]   Why don't you feed all of us?
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:34.420]   Why don't you do--"
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:36.420]   Have you thought about that?
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:40.420]   When Jesus is saying those things and the death to which,
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:44.420]   you recognize He's done all that.
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:47.420]   You have a wise example in your Lord.
[01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:50.420]   But what's more, you have a wise example in your Father,
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:52.420]   our God in heaven,
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:57.420]   who is showing to us His incredible character, where it's both, right?
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:01.420]   It's both absolute righteousness, absolute sinlessness.
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:05.420]   It is a fearful thing because God says, "I will judge everything,
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:09.420]   even the thoughts and intentions that you think nobody sees."
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:12.420]   And what He cares for is the insides, your internals,
[01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:18.420]   the actual content of your mind and your heart as it relates to godliness.
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:23.420]   And what He's saying is, "Be like Me. Be like Me."
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:25.420]   And then as I thought about that,
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:29.420]   there was a part of me as I was doing my devotion, and I thought,
[01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:31.420]   "Oh, man.
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:36.420]   I regularly underestimate how sinful I am.
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:37.420]   And I think my intentions are pretty good.
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:40.420]   I make mistakes, but I'm--you know, like,
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:43.420]   I sorely underestimate how sinful I am."
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:46.420]   And when you see this, and you walk down Matthew,
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:48.420]   and he's talking about "blessed are the meek, poor, gentle,"
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:51.420]   all this kind of stuff, and he's like, "You should be salty,"
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:53.420]   and he starts talking about, "You shouldn't be angry.
[01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:58.420]   You shouldn't lust." And you're like, "Fail, fail, fail, fail, fail," right?
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:00.420]   You could have this weird sentiment,
[01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:03.420]   like this half-rebellious, half-discouraged sentiment in your heart,
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:07.420]   like, "I don't know if I can do that."
[01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:10.420]   Have you guys ever read scripture and felt like that?
[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:14.420]   Or felt so discouraged, like, you almost don't want to look up,
[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:19.420]   and then you kind of want to say to God, like, "I'll try.
[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:21.420]   I have tried," you know?
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:25.420]   And I want to encourage you because you have heard it said,
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:30.420]   "Eye for an eye," and people could not keep that even, right?
[01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:35.420]   Historically, mankind has been so riddled with sin,
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:37.420]   even though you have heard it said,
[01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:41.420]   even the traditions of the old, they were not actually able to keep.
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:45.420]   And so, again, if you're looking at the law of Christ now,
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:48.420]   given to His disciples, please don't be discouraged,
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:51.420]   because I want to give to you something as an encouragement.
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:54.420]   Even the law of the Old Testament, "eye for an eye,"
[01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:57.420]   I believe came from a fatherly heart
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:19:01.420]   that desired to restrain the sinful children.
[01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:03.420]   It's kind of like a dad.
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:06.420]   He sees his two kids just at each other's throat, like, "That's mine!
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:09.420]   No, you took it! It's mine!" Right?
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:12.420]   The dad jumps in and says, "Stop! You only get two minutes!
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:15.420]   You only get--that's the law! It's going to be fair!" Right?
[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:17.420]   That's not him just being annoyed.
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:20.420]   He's actually preventing them destroying each other.
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:25.420]   But remember also, when you hear God saying, "Be like me,"
[01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:28.420]   that is fatherly love and instruction for you.
[01:19:28.420 --> 01:19:31.420]   Because God said in His love for you,
[01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:34.420]   "I want to share my glory with you,"
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:36.420]   which I realize He is also saying,
[01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:39.420]   "I am sharing my character trait with you.
[01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:43.420]   I want you to be like me in my righteousness, in my love,
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:46.420]   the depth to which, yes, you don't fully understand now,
[01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:48.420]   but I'm showing you.
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:52.420]   I have enemies of which you were one, and I came for you.
[01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:57.420]   And I fed you, loved you, even when you were rejecting me and spitting.
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:01.420]   I want you to be like me."
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:06.420]   That is not something for us to be like, "I just can't do that stuff." Right?
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:09.420]   "I can't abide by all your rules."
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:11.420]   Think about it another way.
[01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:17.420]   That's for us to be like, "Thank you, Lord, for being my heavenly Father
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:23.420]   and desiring and saying in your word, 'You shall be perfect.'"
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:25.420]   That's grace upon you. Amen?
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:27.420]   That's love for you.
[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:29.420]   That's fatherly instruction to you.
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:32.420]   So we don't be discouraged when we find these things,
[01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:36.420]   but rather we recognize we need this in this life.
[01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:40.420]   A lot of us have been saying we feel persecution knocking at the door
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:44.420]   for those living here comfortably in Orange County.
[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:48.420]   We are going to have people perhaps accuse us falsely.
[01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:52.420]   We're going to have people try to force us to do things we don't like.
[01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:57.420]   And if you're going to be like, "I'm an American, and I have rights!"
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:00.420]   You do, and that's also true.
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:03.420]   But God desires us to be even more,
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:09.420]   to have such a wealth where this country is not everything to us,
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:13.420]   and we have this fist, this tight-gripped fist,
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:17.420]   where we're like, "Don't you dare threaten the rights that I have!"
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:20.420]   But rather this heart overflowing with the love that Christ says,
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:22.420]   "I've got more to give."
[01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:25.420]   Why? That's just like my dad.
[01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:33.420]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:37.420]   Our God, we want to again thank you so much.
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:42.420]   We recognize, God, that by your word you're leading us, you're teaching us.
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:46.420]   And it is our prayer, God, that we would be humbled to recognize
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:51.420]   that there are many elements of this, Lord, in different facets of our lives.
[01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:55.420]   We do retaliate, and sometimes for us it's even confusing.
[01:21:55.420 --> 01:22:00.420]   Are we trying to uphold the law of God, or are we just getting even?
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:03.420]   And I pray, God, that you give us discernment.
[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:07.420]   Discernment, Lord, God, in our homes, in our workplaces,
[01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:10.420]   so that, Lord, we will shine your glory,
[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:16.420]   so that, Father God, people can see the power of our Father working in us.
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:19.420]   And so I pray, Father God, we humbly acknowledge
[01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:21.420]   none of the things you challenge us to do,
[01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:24.420]   none of the things that you have commanded us to be,
[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:26.420]   is capable in our power.
[01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:29.420]   So we ask of you, Lord, that you would aid us through your truth,
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:31.420]   and that you would guide us in your Spirit.
[01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:35.420]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:38.420]   Let us all rise as we sing our closing praise.
[01:22:38.420 --> 01:23:00.420]   [piano playing]
[01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:02.420]   Though the nations rage,
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:07.420]   Though the nations rage,
[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:11.420]   Kingdoms rise and fall,
[01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:16.420]   There is still one King,
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:20.420]   Ruling over all.
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:25.420]   So I will not fear,
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:29.420]   For this truth remains,
[01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:36.420]   That my God is the Ancient of Days.
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:43.420]   Then above Him, and before Him,
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:47.420]   All the time in His hands,
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:51.420]   For His throne it shall remain,
[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:54.420]   And ever stand.
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:02.420]   All the power, all the glory,
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:06.420]   I will trust in His name,
[01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:13.420]   He my God is, the Ancient of Days.
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:24.420]   Though the dreadful night overwhelms my soul,
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:29.420]   He is here with me,
[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:33.420]   I am not alone.
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:38.420]   Oh His love is sure,
[01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:42.420]   And He knows my name,
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:49.420]   For my God is, the Ancient of Days.
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:56.420]   Then above Him, and before Him,
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:25:00.420]   All the time in His hands,
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:05.420]   For His throne it shall remain,
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:08.420]   And ever stand.
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:14.420]   All the power, all the glory,
[01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:19.420]   I will trust in His name,
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:26.420]   For my God is, the Ancient of Days.
[01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:46.420]   Though I may not see,
[01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:51.420]   What the future brings,
[01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:55.420]   I will watch and wait,
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:26:00.420]   For the Savior came,
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:04.420]   In my joy come train.
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:09.420]   Standing face to face,
[01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:16.420]   In the presence, the Ancient of Days.
[01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:23.420]   Then above Him, and before Him,
[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:27.420]   All the time in His hands,
[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:31.420]   For His throne it shall remain,
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:34.420]   And ever stand.
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:41.420]   All the power, all the glory,
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:45.420]   I will trust in His name,
[01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:53.420]   For my God is, the Ancient of Days.
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:27:02.420]   For my God is, the Ancient of Days.
[01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:16.420]   (piano music)
[01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:19.420]   - Let's end our service in a word of prayer.
[01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:23.420]   All right, God, we want to exalt you and lift you on high,
[01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:27.420]   and to proclaim, Father God, that you are perfect.
[01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:30.420]   And God, in your perfection, Lord, we trust you.
[01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:35.420]   We trust that as things go wrong, as things unravel,
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:40.420]   we know, Lord God, that you are going to enact your perfect justice in your own time.
[01:27:40.420 --> 01:27:45.420]   And we also know that when that just in comes, it's going to be perfect just like you.
[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:50.420]   And Lord God, as a fearsome thing, Lord God, that is something wonderful.
[01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:53.420]   And I pray, Father, that we will exercise our trust in you.
[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:57.420]   As we try to navigate what to do, what's the right thing?
[01:27:57.420 --> 01:28:01.420]   As we even try to control our heart's inclination,
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:06.420]   to take justice into our own hands, to have vengeance for ourselves.
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:09.420]   But I pray, Father God, that we will learn from you,
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:11.420]   and God, that your spirit would guide us.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:14.420]   Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling,
[01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:17.420]   and to make you stand in the presence of his glory,
[01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:22.420]   blameless with great joy, to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ, our Lord,
[01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:28.420]   be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority before all time and now and forever. Amen.
[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:33.420]   God sent his Son
[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:39.420]   They called him Jesus
[01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:49.420]   He came to love, heal and forgive
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:55.420]   He lived and died
[01:28:56.420 --> 01:29:01.420]   To buy my portal
[01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:12.420]   An empty grave is there to my Savior let's
[01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:17.420]   Because he lives
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:22.420]   I'll be raised tomorrow
[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:27.420]   Because he lives
[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:33.420]   All fear is gone
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:39.420]   Because I know
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:44.420]   He holds the future
[01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:49.420]   And life is worth the living
[01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:55.420]   Just because he lives
[01:29:56.420 --> 01:30:01.420]   For those of you guys who are in the sanctuary,
[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:04.420]   you guys can take a moment to take a seat.
[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:07.420]   For those of you guys who are outside in the courtyard,
[01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:11.420]   we do again request that although you guys are fellowshipping,
[01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:13.420]   please don't stay in the courtyard area,
[01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:17.420]   because we're going to be cleaning up and wrapping those things up.
[01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:20.420]   There is extra space at the front of the church,
[01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:22.420]   by the front office side.
[01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:24.420]   There's a lot of shade there, so
