[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.680]   I pray Father God that you would feed us, remind us Lord, of our relationship with you
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.600]   and what it means with all the distractions and entanglement and after a long day's work.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.600]   I pray Lord God that it would be a source of rest and encouragement.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.840]   Just asking Lord God that you would guide and lead us and cause us to hear from you.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.320]   We thank you in Jesus name we pray.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.820]   Amen.
[00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.820]   All right, let me just give you a quick announcement.
[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:42.580]   We weren't sure exactly when we were we would be able to wrap up this Bible study because
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.860]   if the hearing went well yesterday and it was all finished and we closed escrow,
[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.740]   we would not have this building.
[00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.420]   We would probably have to vacate, not Sundays, but weekday Bible study would have probably had
[00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.340]   to end in about a week or two, but because it got kicked down the road and our next continuation
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.420]   hearing is not until the end of September, so that's not going to be the case.
[00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.020]   But as you notice, we covered three chapters this week and then next time we're going to
[00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.520]   be doing 65 and 66, which we're going to end and then we're going to have one more session
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.700]   to review.
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.460]   And then our classes are, this session is supposed to go a week after that.
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.780]   If you guys remember from the very beginning, we said until the end of August.
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.840]   So what we're going to do is after the review at the very end, the last session, instead
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.660]   of coming together, I'm going to ask you guys to have a meeting with your, with your groups.
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.660]   It doesn't have to be here.
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.740]   If you want to use the group, use this building.
[00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.740]   It's up to you.
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.620]   If you guys want to go out and, and have dinner and that could be, so those of you who weren't
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.700]   able to have the activity in your group, that could be your activity.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.180]   So again, so today, next week we have a break because of VBS and then the following week
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.580]   we're going to be finishing up Isaiah chapter 65 and 66.
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.940]   And then the following week after that, we're doing final review.
[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.340]   And then, and then the last session will be within your groups, you know, dinner or whatever
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.340]   you guys, you guys choose to do.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.340]   Okay.
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.340]   And then after that, we're going to be taking a break.
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.340]   Have I got that?
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.340]   Okay.
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.340]   All right.
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.460]   So we're looking at chapter 62, 63 and 64.
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.020]   It's a lot of material to cover.
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:28.140]   So we're going to basically go over the highlights.
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.020]   So if you look at, we're looking at starting from chapter 62, one through 12, what is the
[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.540]   price that God makes with the nation of Israel here?
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.620]   He promises restoration that they're going to be the light to the rest of the world.
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.980]   And he says, they're going to be the burning torch.
[00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.580]   So we talked about that, right?
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.860]   We said there's going to be a millennial kingdom of Israel and that's where God's going to
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.940]   fulfill all the promises he made to the nation of Israel.
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.980]   And then after that will come the final judgment and we're in heaven.
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.620]   But he said, during that period, whether that's a literal thousand years, it's talking about
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.180]   a period at the end times, he says that that's going to happen in Israel is going to be ultimately
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.180]   be the light.
[00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.460]   And the way that they're going to be the light is when they are in the Lord's hands, they're
[00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.820]   no longer struggling for their own success.
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.420]   They're not, they're no longer politically independent.
[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.420]   When the Lord firmly has them in their hands, they're going to be the crown of beauty and
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.060]   royal diadem.
[00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.660]   And then he says that they're going to be a delight to them and he's going to love them
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.100]   as a bridegroom rejoices over the bride.
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.980]   Let me ask you a question just briefly.
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:51.740]   Just you don't have to answer it, but to think about can God be, can God love you more when
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.900]   you sin or not sin?
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.980]   Commonly we hear that there's nothing more you can possibly do to God to love you more
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.180]   or less, right?
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.740]   God knew all your sins, so therefore God, God has never displeased with you.
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:18.180]   Is that true?
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.380]   You know, our relationship with God is just like our relationship with other human beings.
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.100]   God is not a machine, right?
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.180]   So just like with other human beings, if you wrong him, God grieves.
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.820]   He gets angry and he punishes and disciplines.
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.980]   So we see that even with the nation of Israel, he says it's not because God never not loved
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:38.980]   them.
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.300]   There are periods when he says, these are not my people because in anger, but he says
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.660]   even here when he talks about his judgment, he always says he remembers his covenant that
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.060]   he makes with Moses.
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.740]   And as a, because of that, he is faithful ultimately to himself and to the promises
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.740]   that he made to their previous generation.
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.160]   So his love is everlasting.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.060]   But does that mean that in every generation, that no matter what they did, that God's love
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.940]   for them was consistent throughout the whole period?
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.180]   Clearly not, because that's not what he says.
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.300]   He said there are periods in Israel's history where he was so angry with them that he says,
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.620]   I will not answer your prayers.
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.060]   I'm going to treat you like I become like even in the text that we looked at, he says
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.140]   there, there are periods in Israel's history where God says you are not my people.
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.260]   Right?
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.460]   So when we talk about God's everlasting love, he's not saying everlasting love to you no
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.300]   matter what you do, no matter what you say, no matter how you live, it doesn't matter
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.420]   because God's love is consistent forever, never changing.
[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.820]   When we're talking about God's eternal, everlasting love, he's talking about his nature of love
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.840]   that because of his covenant, that his love is consistent because he chose to love the
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.840]   nation of Israel.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.840]   It is consistent.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.860]   And so God is consistent with his commitment to the nation of Israel.
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.860]   But does he hate sin?
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:57.860]   Absolutely.
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.860]   Right?
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.380]   So if we continue to sin, does God just kind of like, ah, you know, you know, my, my kids
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.380]   just spoiled.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.900]   That's just the way it is.
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:14.140]   What does he say about how he deals with sins with his children in the new Testament?
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.620]   Discipline, right?
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.300]   God disciplines just like any other parental relationship.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.300]   Okay.
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.860]   Again, I want to point this out because there's sometimes there's confusion and it leads to
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:34.900]   again, a very cheap grace type of life where it's just like, you know, God's love to me
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.020]   is consistent no matter what I do.
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.020]   It doesn't matter.
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.020]   Right?
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.140]   He's talking, we're talking about the big picture of God's love, his nature of love,
[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.100]   but God hates sin no matter what.
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.100]   Right?
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.380]   So here he describes his relationship with nation of Israel because at the end, God's
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.660]   going to cause them to be righteous.
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.140]   They're going to be in his hands.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.420]   And as a result of that, because of their righteousness, he's going to delight in them.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:09.620]   And because of that, he says the love between them is going to be like a bride and groom.
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:15.220]   The second section of it in verse six and six and seven, who has he put on top?
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.060]   He says the watchman.
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.220]   What's the primary duty of the watchman?
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.220]   Right?
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.540]   Keep people safe to alarm when harm is coming.
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.500]   Is the watchman, the guy out there swinging the sword?
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.500]   Not necessarily.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.540]   He is warning so that the soldiers can get ready.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.540]   Right?
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.180]   So the primary duty of the watchman is to watch and see the wolves and enemies that
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.180]   are attacking.
[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.220]   And that's why I remember in the previous chapters, one of the judgments against the
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:48.540]   watchman who were the leaders of Israel was that they were like silent dogs.
[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.540]   They were meant to be out there to bark, but they can't bark.
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.060]   Right?
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:00.620]   He calls them, he says not to be silent, verse six and seven.
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.340]   So the language he uses here is on your walls, O Jerusalem, I have set watchmen all day and
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.340]   all night.
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:06.900]   They shall never be silent.
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.060]   All day and all night.
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.060]   Right?
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.020]   Why all day and all night?
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:18.740]   Because they are never going to be at peace until the Lord comes.
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.740]   Right?
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.300]   And here, the next part is really interesting.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.860]   He says, you who put the Lord in remembrance, take no rest.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.860]   Right?
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.060]   What does he mean by that?
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:35.940]   Is he saying constantly remind the Lord?
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:36.940]   Is that what he is saying?
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:43.700]   What do you think?
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.340]   Is that what he is saying?
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.740]   The duty of the watchman is to constantly remind the Lord.
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:54.620]   Don't think too deeply.
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.620]   That's exactly what he says.
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:57.620]   Right?
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.100]   Now why does God need to be reminded?
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:11.500]   See, it's not because God forgot, obviously.
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:12.500]   Right?
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.420]   It's not because God forgot.
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.420]   God is basically telling his children to come.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.700]   And it's just like he said, if you abide in me, my words abide in you.
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.340]   Ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for you.
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.500]   So if we are abiding in his words, right?
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.180]   And we are abiding in him, why do we even need to ask?
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.700]   But God says to come.
[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:35.020]   He wants us to come continually and say, hey, you made this covenant, remind me.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.020]   Right?
[00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.020]   Keep reminding me.
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.820]   So part of our sanctification and part of our worship to God is to keep coming to him
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.420]   and say, God, this is your purpose.
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.420]   Fulfill your purpose.
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.700]   And not only does he say that, and then verse 7, and give him no rest until he establishes
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.700]   Jerusalem.
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.700]   Right?
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.140]   Isn't that interesting, the way he puts it?
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.140]   Give him no rest.
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.140]   Who's the him?
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.140]   God.
[00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.420]   Don't let God rest.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:05.460]   Isn't that the parable that he teaches?
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.660]   About the widow that comes and he just knocks and knocks and knocks and irritates the judge
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.860]   to the point, he says, not because he's a good judge, but because you're irritating.
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.140]   Right?
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:19.900]   And he tells the parable to come to him in that way, persistently, continuously.
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.580]   And so he says to the watchman that you should not remain silent.
[00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.300]   You should be vigilant, constantly bring into the Lord his will.
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.300]   Right?
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:35.300]   You said you're going to establish your church and to keep praying according to his promise.
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:40.440]   You said that you desire all men to be saved, to constantly bring to remembrance that this
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.780]   is your will.
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:48.540]   Not because he forgot, but every time we remind him, what happens to us?
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.700]   We're reminded.
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.540]   And that's how we engage in his purpose.
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.780]   By constantly bringing to him.
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:59.900]   He says, so never to rest, don't ever give him rest until he establishes what he has
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.700]   promised on earth.
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.780]   Right?
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.340]   So how do we do that?
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.900]   The first and most obvious thing.
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:08.900]   Pray.
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:09.900]   Right?
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.900]   So that's what he's saying.
[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:16.860]   He says the watchman is not only to warn the people, but it's be constantly vigilant in
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.500]   praying.
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:26.180]   Praying and pleading on behalf of the nation, the church, our generation.
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.580]   So isn't that interesting to remind?
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.540]   You have to constantly remind him.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.540]   You said this.
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.540]   Right?
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:46.140]   In 63 he says, who is this who comes from Edom in crimson garments from Bozrah, he
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:50.300]   who is splendid in his apparel, matching in the greatness of his strength.
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:56.060]   Why does he use Edom and he says he's coming from Edom to bring judgment?
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.580]   Who are the Edomites?
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.340]   What kind of relationship do the Edomites have with Israel?
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.820]   Kind of like cousins.
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.780]   They were the closest kin outside of immediate family.
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:08.780]   Right?
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.060]   And they were constantly in battle with the nation of Israel.
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.480]   They were the arch enemies.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:20.900]   So a few of the, if you guys remember some of the Old Testament history, Edom was characterized
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.820]   by perpetual enmity against the nation of Israel.
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.780]   When Israel was invaded by the Babylonians, the Edomites rejoiced in their defeat and
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.780]   captivity.
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:34.020]   In fact, there's a whole minor prophet written about the judgment against Edom because of
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.020]   that.
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.020]   And an earlier date, Edom had refused to allow Israel to pass through their land when the
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.220]   Israelites are on their way to the promised land of Canaan.
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:46.820]   So right off the bat, from the very beginning, the Edomites were the closest kin, but they
[00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:51.260]   were also the closest enemy.
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:58.300]   So when he says from Edom he's coming, right, and he's talking about this judgment, typically,
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.060]   if you look at the way God brings judgment upon the nation of Israel, does he just come
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.900]   from the sky and then bring lightning?
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:04.900]   Right?
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:05.980]   I mean, that could happen.
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.080]   He brings famine and disease.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.080]   He does that too.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.500]   But predominantly, what does he do?
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.620]   He brings nations, Babylonians, Assyrians, Egyptians.
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:24.140]   So he's talking about the closest of your kin is going to be the source of judgment.
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:29.440]   The city of Basra that's mentioned here, it's because it was the capital of the ancient
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.500]   city of Edom.
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:37.820]   And the reason why that name is mentioned specifically is because the name literally
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.220]   means great gathering.
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:44.500]   And Isaiah develops this detailed comparison between treading graves and pouring out blood.
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:52.060]   So when it's talking about pouring out blood, either it's talking about redemption or what?
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.460]   Judgment.
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.740]   Right?
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.500]   Or both.
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:04.200]   When the Lord pours out his blood, it's because the Lord had brought judgment upon him.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:14.820]   So that's why he mentions that particular city.
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:20.620]   What does he mean in chapter 63 verse 5 when he says, "I looked, but there was no one
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:21.620]   to help.
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.320]   I was appalled, but there was no one to uphold."
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.320]   Sorry, so is it just that nation?
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.880]   Is it like, go beyond that nation?
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:36.240]   So the Edomites were, they represented all the foreign, outside nation, and the judgment
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.320]   is not limited to them.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:42.760]   He begins with them, but it's not limited to them.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:48.440]   So when he said he didn't find any help, he's talking about, it doesn't just talk about
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.160]   salvation, but it's also talking about his judgment, but there was no one to help.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.480]   Meaning, there's nothing that man could do.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.820]   Salvation for Israel could not be accomplished together.
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:06.600]   This was the work of God and God alone.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.920]   Israel was not going to be playing a part in the salvation of mankind.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:16.920]   They are, you know, in one sense, but not what the Lord was going to do on the cross.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:30.300]   It was going to be one man's act.
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:35.300]   So if you look at chapter 63, 7, it says, "I will recount the steadfast love of the
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.660]   Lord, the praise of the Lord, according to all that the Lord has granted us."
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:47.920]   So chapter 63, 7 through 14 and on, is a list of things that remind the nation of Israel
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.360]   of their relationship with God.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:16:00.320]   So the history of Israel is the history of God's steadfast love for his people.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:12.760]   Is Israel's history pretty smooth and non-eventful?
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.060]   Majority of Israel's history was filled with turmoil.
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.060]   Majority of it.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.220]   There are pockets of peace, right?
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:24.560]   There are periods maybe during Hezekiah's reign, there's periods during David's reign.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.140]   There's pockets of peace in Israel's history, but for the most part, when you think of Israel,
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:34.340]   you're talking a tiny little nation being kicked around back and forth.
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:39.580]   Every once in a while, God would raise up a king or a judge, and then he would use them
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:45.780]   to bring them to prominence, but as soon as that happens, Israel forgets about God, and
[00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.700]   they fall right back into judgment.
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:55.020]   When Isaiah in chapter 63, 7 and on, he says, "This is the history, Israel's history,
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:17:00.780]   the whole of Israel's history is a record of God's faithful love toward the nation of
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:05.660]   Israel, during the good and the bad, even when they're being disciplined, even when
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:11.540]   God's judgment was coming upon them, it was all because God loved this nation."
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:20.740]   When God's ultimate judgment comes, how is God's ultimate judgment described in the Bible?
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.620]   When he kind of pleads with his people, he disciplines them, and they don't respond,
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:31.340]   they remain stiff-necked, what does God do?
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.500]   He turns them over, right?
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.620]   He releases them to their own sins, right?
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.940]   And that's how it's described in Romans chapter 1.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:43.620]   They refuse to acknowledge the truth, so therefore God releases them, right?
[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:47.220]   If that's what you want, that's what you do, right?
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:56.100]   But here, when Israel history is described, it describes in detail his faithfulness.
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:01.340]   Even when they are being afflicted, the way it's described, God himself is afflicted because
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.340]   he loves them.
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:08.660]   So even as they're sometimes being judged and overthrown by greater nations, God's love
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:14.020]   is clearly evident.
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.820]   Despite all of God's faithfulness, Israel continues to rebel.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.340]   Again, this is, we're kind of closing in at the end of Isaiah, and basically what's happening
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:26.700]   in Isaiah is reminiscing about Israel's history, right?
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.620]   And then talking about the faithfulness of God.
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:35.140]   So despite all of that, God remains faithful, because the Lord remembers the old days, the
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:39.340]   covenant that he makes with Moses, right?
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.500]   So again, a lot of times you read the Old Testament, and people read it kind of like,
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:47.380]   "That's not relevant, because it's in the Old Testament, it's for the nation of Israel."
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:51.260]   But every time you read the Old Testament, and you read the covenants, and how God remains
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:19:00.140]   faithful, that is a picture of his nature, and that is a reminder to all of us that the
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:05.460]   reason why God is faithful today is because he was faithful before, right?
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.020]   Because that's who he is.
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:13.460]   So if we read in the Old Testament where God just changes his mind, and a flood comes,
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.900]   every generation a flood comes, even though he said he wasn't going to do it, he just,
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.860]   you know, he's God, what are you going to do about it?
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:20.860]   Right?
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:26.100]   Then we should be trembling in fear, no matter what he promised, every time we sin, and every
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.780]   time we fail, we should be afraid that the flood is coming.
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:34.660]   But we're not, and the reason why we're not is because God made a covenant, and he's faithful
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.660]   to his promise.
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:40.740]   So he said even though God was faithful, and they would continue to rebel, he said he would
[00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.020]   always remember his covenant with Moses, right?
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.300]   The covenant with the previous generation.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:54.100]   So he remains faithful.
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.580]   So what does it mean, verse 16, that they do not acknowledge him?
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:02.500]   Verse 16, "For you are our father, though Abraham does not know us, and Israel does
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:07.260]   not acknowledge us, you, O Lord, are our father, our Redeemer from of old is your name."
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:19.740]   What is that in reference to?
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.780]   There's actually two things, and I didn't write the other thing down.
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:28.100]   It could be in reference to the Gentile nation, that God is bringing them into the fold, right?
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.380]   I didn't write that one down.
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:35.700]   The other one, other possibility, that he's talking about the remnant of Israel.
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.780]   The remnant of Israel, who the nation as a whole, remember in the previous chapter, it
[00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.940]   was the righteous who were dying?
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.460]   It was the righteous who were being persecuted?
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:53.500]   So in Israel's history, at the end, there's going to be a segment of Israel repenting,
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:21:00.220]   but Israel as a whole hasn't repented.
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.300]   But either way, whether it's a remnant of the nation of Israel, or he's talking about
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:20.480]   the Gentiles, he's saying that there's a segment of them, that describes verse 16.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:26.260]   What does it mean in verse 16 when it states that Israel does not acknowledge them?
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:38.540]   Okay, I just wrote what John Calvin wrote concerning this.
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.440]   It says, "The prophet uses a common form of speaking, for it is usual in the scriptures
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:46.460]   to say that God gives the wicked over to the reprobate mind, and hardens their hearts."
[00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:51.740]   So in verse 17, it says, "Oh Lord, why do you make us wander from your ways, and harden
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.340]   our hearts so that we fear you not?
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.500]   Return for the sake of your servant, the tribes of your heritage."
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:04.380]   So the question was, is he pleading with God because God is causing them to sin?
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:08.620]   Is that how you would answer that?
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.620]   Right?
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.620]   Obviously not.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:15.320]   The scripture makes it clear that God is not the originator of evil.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:22.860]   So here, again, the language may be confusing, but it says, it's not that God is causing
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:23.860]   this to happen, right?
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:29.260]   Remember when he was talking about how he hardens the heart of Pharaoh?
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:35.900]   The same sun that melts the clay, melts the ice, hardens the clay?
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.180]   So when God appears, remember, he's coming.
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:42.380]   Is he going to be, when Jesus comes, is he going to be two separate people?
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:45.640]   He's going to be this one Redeemer who comes to redeem the church, and then he's going
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.900]   to have this fiery fury that's described in Revelations 1.
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.700]   Is he going to be two separate people?
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.580]   Same person, right?
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:23:00.380]   Depending on where you stand with that, you're going to meet a very different Jesus.
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.220]   You're going to meet the Jesus that's going to come to judge, or you're going to meet
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:07.140]   the Jesus who comes and sheds his blood to redeem.
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.100]   But not everybody is going to see Jesus the same way, right?
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.220]   I always think about the police.
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:19.780]   When police show up, either you're happy or you're not happy, depending on if you're guilty
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:22.660]   or not guilty, right?
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:26.220]   If you've gotten robbed and the police show up, you're very thankful, right?
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:30.980]   And that's why he talks about when the Lord comes, he comes about, he talks about redemption
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.820]   and judgment at the same time.
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.700]   Retribution is going to come with restoration.
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:42.500]   And that's like a cop, when a police officer shows up, he's going to punish the bad guys,
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:47.860]   and punishing the bad guys is part of redeeming the good guys, right?
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:53.060]   So that's how it's described at the end when Jesus comes, and he comes in his full glory.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:24:01.580]   Not only are the righteous going to be saved, but the wicked are going to be punished.
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.660]   What does Isaiah confess at the end?
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:16.380]   And he confesses his own sins, along with the sins of the whole nation.
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:23.860]   You notice that in scripture, that whenever there is an encounter with God, that always
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:27.060]   leads to repentance, right?
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.940]   It always leads to a deeper recognition of sin.
[00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:37.220]   So if you remember, Isaiah begins, it doesn't happen until chapter 6, but Isaiah begins
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:41.140]   with Isaiah's encounter with the holiness of God, right?
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.980]   And what happens to Isaiah at that time?
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:45.980]   He's purified, he repents.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.380]   Woe is he, and woe is me.
[00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.780]   I'm a man of uncleanness from a people of uncleanness.
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:56.700]   So the first thing that happens before he is set apart for the gospel ministry, the
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:01.100]   Old Testament gospel, is that he repents.
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.180]   He sees the glory of God.
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:06.340]   So in order for him to be the light to the nation of Israel, he needs to first be in
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.540]   the presence of the light, right?
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:13.380]   So if you, even though it happens in chapter 6, now that we're getting at the tail end,
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.780]   talking about end times, what happens?
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.780]   Confession.
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.660]   Repentance.
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:30.540]   So one clear sign that there is a movement of God is that there is a growing movement
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:37.660]   of repentance, acknowledgement of our sins, and our weakness, and our brokenness, right?
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.780]   Repentance isn't just singing loud and church growing and people loving each other.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:49.580]   All of these things are ramifications of genuine revival, but at the core of revival is repentance.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.500]   Repentance over our sins, repentance over what we are inside, repentance over how we
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.540]   live, right?
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.580]   Revival always at the core of it is repentance.
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:01.740]   It's not like, okay, we haven't been doing this right, so we're going to do this right.
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:10.340]   I guess that could be repentance, but it's always a deeper sense of our sinfulness.
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:16.860]   Not deeper sense of other people's sinfulness, but deeper sense of my sinfulness.
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:23.460]   That's why anybody who has any desire to represent God and is not aware of their own sins, that
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:28.340]   immediately disqualifies them, right?
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.780]   Because that's what ministry is.
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:34.620]   Ministry is declaring the glory of God, and a man who is going to declare the glory of
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:39.300]   God has to be a witness of this glory of God.
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:43.380]   And what is the evidence that he witnessed the glory of God?
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.940]   A brokenness over his own sins.
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:52.580]   So if a man desires to do ministry and preach the gospel and there is no brokenness over
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:59.420]   his own sins, that's evidence that he is not aware of the glory of God, right?
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:06.780]   So we see at the tail end of his prophecy, Isaiah confesses his sins.
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.260]   Is this the last one?
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.820]   Yeah, I forgot to highlight this.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.820]   It's right here.
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.820]   Where did I miss it?
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.820]   Is it here?
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.820]   Oh no.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:25.820]   Boom.
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:26.820]   Okay.
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:32.780]   You guys know this phrase right here, "All our righteous deeds are like polluted garment."
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.820]   Or, what's another way they put it?
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.820]   "Filthy rags."
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.820]   "Filthy rags."
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:37.820]   Okay?
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.820]   So how is that used?
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.460]   Every good thing that we do is useless, right?
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.340]   Is that what he means here?
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:49.940]   In the context of what we've been studying, is that what he means?
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.780]   All our righteous deeds are filthy rags.
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:57.500]   So therefore, every righteous thing that we do is absolutely useless.
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.780]   Is it absolutely useless?
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:00.780]   What does he mean here?
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.780]   It's going back to the "you can't make yourself" part.
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:02.780]   God was looking for someone to make him right.
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:03.780]   We can't make ourselves.
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:16.080]   So we can do righteous things in appreciation of it, but it's to restore our relationship.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.400]   So where you see your righteousness.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.400]   Okay.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.400]   Anybody else?
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:31.440]   There's a lot of chatter going on in that table when nobody's talking.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.440]   Nothing?
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.320]   Okay.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:40.040]   What has he been indicting Israel of up to this point in this media context?
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:43.200]   False religion.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:52.080]   So when he says about all our righteous deeds are filthy rags, why are they filthy rags?
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.680]   Because the righteous deeds were tainted with dirty hands.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.680]   They were oppressing the poor.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.080]   Right?
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.520]   They were taking advantage of weak people.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.720]   And they said all the fasts that they have were fake.
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.740]   All the praying that they were doing was for selfishness.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:11.700]   So all this righteous thing that they were doing was for selfish gain.
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.760]   So it wasn't real righteousness.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.520]   Like they were praying and feeding the poor.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.880]   And he said all of that is useless before God.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:24.880]   That's sometimes this passage is used to knock any kind of like pursuit of holiness because
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.920]   all our pursuit of holiness is filthy rags.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.360]   Is that what he is saying?
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.360]   No.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.440]   Does God call them to pursue holiness?
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.600]   Absolutely.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.880]   Does God want them to live righteous lives?
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.520]   He says to plead with him and remind him constantly of his promises.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.880]   He said do not let him rest.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:46.920]   Does that sound like a passive, you know, just kind of let God do whatever he does?
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.920]   Right?
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.380]   Absolutely not.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:55.200]   God demands his people to actively, purposefully pursue him.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.400]   Right?
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:02.200]   So he's not saying that all your active pursuit of God is filthy rags.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:07.920]   He's saying the nation of Israel in particular in their false religion, right?
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.040]   They're oppressing the poor and doing all these sins behind the scenes.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.680]   But they're coming to the temple and offering sacrifices in God's eyes.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.680]   It's meaningless.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.160]   Was he angry with the sacrifices?
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.160]   No.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.800]   He was angry with the people who were coming with dirty hands.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.400]   They weren't truly repenting.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.400]   Right?
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.120]   They weren't repenting of their heart.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.680]   They just thought that if they killed the animal, that would take care of it.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.800]   Right?
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.800]   Just like at church.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.240]   If you're coming and doing all these things for other people to see, that's what makes
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.720]   your righteous deeds filthy.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.360]   Because it wasn't an act of worship.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:46.600]   Instead of truly repenting, you memorize scripture.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.840]   Instead of truly repenting, you're more active at church.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.840]   Right?
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.840]   Or you give more.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.200]   That's what he's referring to.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.200]   Empty religion.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.200]   Right?
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:00.360]   He's not knocking passionate pursuit of Christ and holiness.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:06.120]   All right.
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.240]   We have two more sessions and we're going to be wrapping up Isaiah.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:15.320]   Some of you guys who are sat through the whole teaching of Isaiah, you may have a little
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.040]   bit more understanding of Isaiah than before.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.440]   But that's still better than before.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.440]   Right?
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.440]   Okay.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:30.440]   Brian's not here.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:30.640]   Somebody can ...
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:40.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
