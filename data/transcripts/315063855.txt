[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720]   Thank you, Lord, for giving us just the resources to be able to study together.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:16.600]   We pray that you would help us to love your Word and to love all of it and to have all
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.760]   of it be useful in guiding our lives.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:30.400]   Help us to learn and glean from just your saints of old and help us to really seek to
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.640]   apply properly the various texts that we find in Scripture.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.320]   I pray, Father God, that you would help us to really engage in this hour and a half,
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.720]   help our brains to be extra gooey and sticky so that everything sticks, and help us just
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.800]   to enjoy learning your Word.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.200]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:03.080]   If you guys looked at the worksheet, you'll notice there's a lot less writing to do.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.160]   It was brought to my attention in the previous worksheets, there's so much writing.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.560]   I'm explaining as you're trying to write down stuff.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.560]   There might be things that you miss.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.920]   That was an awesome word of advice that I was given.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.640]   If there are things you're like, "You know what?
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.440]   This is a way we can improve the study of God's Word by all means, let me know.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.440]   I'm all ears."
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.440]   Okay?
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.200]   If you'll notice, you're going to get answers ahead of time now because there aren't as
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.640]   many blanks.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.440]   That just means you just got to engage and try to pay more close attention.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.520]   I'm going to give your hands a little bit of a break from this point forward.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.680]   In between each slide, I'll try to give you additional information that I feel like would
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.160]   be helpful.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.620]   If there are other things that you're like, "You know what?
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.360]   This would help if we had this."
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.400]   Someone came up to me and said, "Can I improve on your slides to make them more modern?"
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.020]   I said, "By all means, do it."
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.440]   We may never do this class again, so I don't know if that's going to be useful.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.880]   By all means, if there are things that you want to help us to engage better, let's do
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.280]   it.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.320]   For you guys who came a little bit early, you noticed that Lawrence was having a tutoring
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.940]   session.
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.200]   Every week, you guys can do that just to get together and review.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.880]   My encouragement is the longer you focus on this six weeks, the longer you'll be able
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.960]   to retain.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.840]   Try to memorize as much as you can.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.920]   A lot of the memorization is going to come easy, but some of the stuff like the dates,
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.480]   that's only going to serve to be beneficial to you.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.880]   Treat this like you're studying for a class, but it's a little easier to study for because
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:52.760]   a lot of the bigger picture things are there for you.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.080]   I'm going to briefly do this.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.080]   Let's see.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.280]   In your heads, what's Genesis about?
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.280]   In your heads.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.280]   Exodus.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.280]   Do you guys see pictures?
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.040]   Leviticus.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.800]   Numbers.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.000]   "Duet Run On Me."
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.200]   Joshua.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.120]   What's a picture you see?
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.120]   Okay.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.120]   How about judges?
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.120]   Right?
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.120]   Ruth.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.120]   One Samuel.
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.120]   Two Samuel.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.840]   What is one king about?
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.640]   What are two kings about?
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.240]   One chronicle.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.880]   Two chronicles.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.880]   Ezra.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.880]   Ezra.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.880]   Ezra.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.880]   What's that about?
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.880]   Nehemiah.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.480]   What's that about?
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.040]   Then we looked at some stuff last week.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.560]   Esther.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.240]   And Esther is a Persian word, right?
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.320]   It's not even a Jewish name.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.920]   Her name is Hadassah, but Esther.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.920]   Job.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.920]   Psalms.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.560]   What animal do you see when you think of Proverbs?
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.560]   That owl.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.560]   Ecclesiastes.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.120]   Song of Solomon.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.800]   You can tell that's Solomon because he has half that heart.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.800]   I say uh.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.100]   Do you remember 39 and 27?
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.120]   That's not just Old and New Testament.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.600]   39 chapters of what?
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   Weeping.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.400]   27 chapters of hope.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.200]   Jeremiah.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.320]   Judah is rotten to the core.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.620]   So those are the things that we covered.
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:57.560]   If you guys remember the distinctives of Saul, David, and Solomon, just remember bad USA,
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.980]   Temple City Proverbs teacher.
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:07.400]   The kings, 1, 6, 11, and 16 are king who?
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.400]   Reh-a-jo-jo.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:17.400]   1 was Reh-a-bo-um's Ab-ah's Jeh-jeh.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.680]   Last week we learned, aha!
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.920]   The queens, Jehoash's are what?
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.200]   Amazing Uzis.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.800]   So if I gave you time, you could probably do this on a test.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.760]   Like the kings 1 through 10 in order.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.840]   And we're going to do the next five today.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.000]   How do we remember the civil war to the time of Assyria?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.520]   We jam in, right?
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.780]   War, Elijah, Elisha, Assyria, and most of the focus is in the north.
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.760]   And what are the books of the Bible, the prophets that kind of fit in that time period?
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:16.240]   Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, Nahum.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.080]   And what are the two bookends that describe the destruction of Assyria?
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.960]   Hope and then destruction.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.960]   Jonah and Nahum.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.240]   That you guys remember.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.400]   And you guys remember this?
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.400]   Cheer.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.560]   Okay, what are these three blue dates?
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.480]   King-king split.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.120]   So if I gave you a test, 10-10 stands for who becoming king.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.480]   David, how about 970?
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.920]   Solomon, and what happens in 930?
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:53.520]   The civil war, 10 tribes go north, two tribes go south, eventually Israel, Judah, Samaria,
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.600]   Benjamin, and what was the problem of the north?
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.080]   Golden calf worship.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:07.360]   And then if you look at just even the geography, you have the Sea of Galilee, in the middle
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:13.660]   you have the Jordan River, and at the bottom you have the Dead Sea.
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:14.660]   What are these?
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.600]   A, B, C, D. Okay?
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.080]   And we learned last week a little cheer.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.760]   Split two, seven, two, two, split two, seven, two, two.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:32.880]   We're gonna learn the other three in a poem, authored by me this week.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.680]   And then we have the Medo-Persians, the returns, and 333.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.040]   Some people say 331, I just put 333 'cause it's easier to remember.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.720]   Okay, and that's the Greeks.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.200]   And then you have the time of Jesus.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.680]   And we remembered, we jamen is how we remember that little section.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:08:01.200]   Between the split and Assyria, we are jamen, war, Elijah, Assyria, Jonah, Amos, Hosea,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:09.160]   Isaiah, Micah, and Nahum.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.840]   Today we're gonna learn a poem, okay?
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.280]   So I'm gonna go slow and I'm gonna say it a few times and then try to remember it.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:25.000]   So you're not writing anything down, so just try to memorize it, okay?
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.040]   Look up, don't look at the poem yet, okay?
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.600]   Just try to think logically.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.280]   Six, 12, Assyria's shelved.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.280]   You guys got that?
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.800]   Six, 12, Assyria's shelved.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.160]   What's shelved mean?
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.840]   It's gone, right?
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:51.480]   Six, 12, Assyria's shelved, Judah soon to follow.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.480]   Logically do you guys, is this easy to track?
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.480]   Okay.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:00.720]   Six, 12, Assyria's shelved, Judah soon to follow.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.680]   What year did Babylon conquer Assyria?
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.600]   612, okay?
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.040]   And who did they conquer?
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.240]   Assyria.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.360]   What book prophecies 612, you think?
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.720]   Nahum does, okay?
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:24.520]   Six, 12, Assyria's shelved, and then what happens?
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:33.160]   Judah soon to follow, 586, the temple's nixed.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.960]   So what happens in 586?
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.680]   Temple's gone.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.040]   And then who laments and wallows?
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.680]   Jeremiah laments and wallows.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.680]   Do you think Jeremiah and lamentations are about the temple?
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.080]   Okay, now you know, okay?
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.440]   Here we go.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.440]   Close your eyes.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.800]   Six, 12, what's the next line?
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:01.040]   Assyria's shelved, and who is soon to follow?
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.440]   Judah soon to follow, 586.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.560]   What's nixed?
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.720]   Temple's nixed.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.840]   Jeremiah laments and wallows.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.840]   Okay?
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.320]   We'll do the whole poem about three times.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.320]   Here we go.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.840]   Try to do it without looking.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:26.240]   Six, 12, Assyria's shelved, Judah soon to follow.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:31.280]   586, temple's nixed.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.120]   Jeremiah laments and wallows.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:41.520]   Six, 12, Assyria's shelved, Judah soon to follow.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.760]   586, temple's nixed.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.440]   Jeremiah laments and wallows.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.440]   Last time.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:56.400]   Six, 12, Assyria's shelved, Judah soon to follow.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.600]   586, temple's nixed.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.600]   Jeremiah laments and wallows.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:10.440]   So six, 12, Assyria's shelved, and Judah is soon to follow.
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:17.720]   Here it says, in the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.000]   king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem and besieged it.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.740]   That's actually how Daniel starts.
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.680]   And that's also how Jeremiah ends in the 50s, okay?
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.820]   Chapter like 52, okay?
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:38.760]   And when Judah gets shelved also, you end up with 70 years of captivity, okay?
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.920]   And what is that cap- what's the C?
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.880]   A, B, C, what's a C?
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.600]   That's the captivity, okay?
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.800]   So the 70 years of a captivity, why did they happen?
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:57.200]   Because every seven years, the people were supposed to let the land rest.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.200]   Did they obey it?
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.720]   No, they didn't obey it at all.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.480]   So they didn't obey it for about 490 years.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.520]   They said, "Oh, it's just too ideal.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.280]   It's not practical.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.880]   God's law and word is just for ideal standards and good situations.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.280]   We don't really need to obey this."
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.700]   So 490 years, the land never rested.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.320]   So God says, "You're gonna pay this land back.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.440]   You're gonna take 70 years.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.000]   You're gonna be away from the land.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.860]   So it's gonna just be wild, okay?"
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:31.940]   And so the 70 years are actually measured in two ways, and it's on your paper.
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:41.120]   You can either measure it from the first exile in Babylon to the arrival back to the land.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:48.820]   Or 5, 8, 6 temples next, that destruction, and then the second temple is actually completed.
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.520]   What book of the Bible talks about the second temple being completed?
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.520]   Ezra, okay?
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.100]   So the second temple is completed.
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:06.140]   So 612, Assyrias shelved, Judah soon to follow.
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.440]   So when you're thinking Judah soon to follow, think the sea, okay?
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:16.300]   And 70 years of people being taken in three waves back to Babylon.
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:21.760]   Babylon had a habit of taking the best and brightest of every country that they conquered,
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:29.440]   the best looking, the smartest, and they wanted to train them up as Babylonians so that later,
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.080]   Babylonian empire can just be everywhere.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:39.680]   And amongst those, among them, four of those guys we know about, Daniel, Azariah, Mishael,
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.880]   Hananiah, who are those guys?
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.040]   We know them by their Persian name or Babylonian names.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.620]   Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, okay?
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:55.440]   So Daniel, Mishael, Azariah, Hananiah, those guys are the Jews that were amongst those
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.800]   taken captive during these 70 years, okay?
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.040]   How many of you guys have lived 70 years ago?
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.040]   How old were you guys?
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:08.440]   I know Dr. Peng just was born, okay?
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.240]   So 70 years is a long time.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.280]   That's like three or four generations.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.800]   And remember, Jews got married in their teens.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.680]   So possibly even five generations were just during captivity, okay?
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.520]   So one more time with the poem.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:38.120]   Six, 12, Assyrias shelved, Judah soon to follow, 586, temples nixed, Jeremiah laments and wallows.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.680]   So what's this 586, temples nixed?
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.680]   That one's easy.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.600]   We'll learn next week why this happened, okay?
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:51.880]   But basically the last king of Judah rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.880]   Actually, I'll just tell you now.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:02.640]   Zedekiah was like a 20, no, no, he was like a 30-year-old king, okay?
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.220]   So he thought, ooh, we shall overcome.
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.120]   So let's fight back against Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.120]   So he does that.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.080]   Nebuchadnezzar in a rage destroys the temple.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:18.760]   And then Zedekiah's children, it says his sons are slaughtered before his eyes.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.520]   So Zedekiah's tied up looking at his sons being slaughtered, and then he gets his eyes
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.900]   gouged out.
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:31.400]   And that's the last thing Zedekiah sees is all of his chief leaders and his sons being
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.120]   slaughtered in front of his eyes.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.480]   Zedekiah was 30.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.480]   How old were his kids?
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.520]   They're not grown kids.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:48.760]   So Zedekiah actually has to watch his little children just being crushed and like slain
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:53.040]   and slaughtered in the cruelest of ways, and then that's the last thing he sees.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.920]   And that's 586 is a horrible time.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.600]   So Jeremiah probably was there to witness all this.
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:06.120]   So he's saying the king's whole family just got slaughtered, these beautiful children.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.240]   What sin did they commit?
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.480]   They got slaughtered.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.480]   This temple is destroyed.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.720]   So he's lamenting.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.600]   So Jeremiah laments and wallows.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.600]   What is he lamenting?
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.160]   There are two things.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.800]   The book of Jeremiah is about what?
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:31.080]   Rottenness of Judah we looked at last week.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:38.040]   And it's like a dirty waistband that he purchased that just went rotten.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.880]   But what is it that he laments?
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:48.240]   The book of Lamentations is about weeping over Judah's losses.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:54.120]   I'm going to read chapter 1, verse 1 for you, Lamentations 1.1.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:59.440]   How lovely sits the city that was once full of people.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:06.160]   She has become like a widow who was once great among the nations.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:12.920]   She who was a princess among the provinces has become a forced laborer.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.800]   So he's weeping over the fact that Jerusalem is now empty.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.800]   Because guess what happened to all the people?
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.920]   They either got killed or they got taken away.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:28.760]   So it's kind of like the hustle and bustle of Manhattan.
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.400]   Literally just being wiped out.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.400]   And all you've got left over are animals and homeless people.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.680]   And just people like scavenging for stuff.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.200]   So that's what he saw.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:45.400]   Lamentations 3.22.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:50.960]   The Lord's loving kindness indeed never ceases.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.520]   His mercies never come to an end.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.240]   His compassions never fail.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.320]   They are new every morning.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.760]   What's the next verse?
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.680]   New every morning.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.280]   Great is thy faithfulness, O Lord.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.080]   That's Lamentations 3.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:09.420]   So he's actually sitting there in front of this ruined city lamenting, but he's also
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.720]   hoping in God.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.280]   So the next time you sing like this, steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.440]   His mercies never come to an end.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.220]   They are new every morning.
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.800]   You sing that, you've got to remember the context.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:29.440]   This is at the worst moment in their history.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.320]   Nice.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.360]   Someone's hanging out upstairs.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.840]   So Lamentations is about what?
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.880]   Weeping over Judah's losses.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.880]   6.12.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:47.000]   Assyria is shelved.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.360]   Judah soon to follow.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.720]   5.8.6.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.800]   Saul's next.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.600]   Jeremiah laments and wallows.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.920]   So what lesson did they finally learn?
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:09.720]   So what is it now that the people of Judah finally got to understand?
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:19.040]   That idolatry is a flaw.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:26.520]   What did they have taken away because of the hundreds of years of idolatry?
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.260]   They lost their freedom.
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:34.560]   They lost their land.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.720]   They lost their power, their armies, their weapons.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:44.920]   They weren't even allowed to carry weapons by the time you get to the New Testament.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.640]   You guys notice that?
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.480]   Just maybe a sword or a knife.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.480]   And they lost all their wealth.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.160]   So freedom, they are now slaves.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.200]   First in Babylon and then what country?
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.240]   Persia.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:10.280]   They don't have a country anymore except for a brief period where in the Maccabean revolution
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.960]   they got their land back.
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.960]   That's why they celebrate.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.040]   You know Hanukkah?
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.300]   The Jewish holiday?
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.240]   That's what the celebration is about.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.800]   Hanukkah is not necessarily in scripture.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.720]   But they are celebrating that time of freedom where they finally got their land back.
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.080]   But they lost it again.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:30.840]   So between Malachi and Matthew they got their land back and they lost it again.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.200]   And they don't get their land back until 1945.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:40.800]   So for almost 2,000 years, over 2,000 years, Israel has no country.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.560]   What happened in 1945?
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.440]   Israel came back on the map.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.520]   Which is a miracle.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.200]   Because people don't disappear for 2,000 years and then a country is formed again.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.840]   You guys following me?
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.720]   This is important because we are going to look at Ezekiel today.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.560]   So for 2,000 years they had no land.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.120]   People's theology changed.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:11.260]   You know most of the church before World War II, everybody was a Presbyterian.
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:15.080]   They believed there was no plan for Israel.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:19.640]   But after Israel showed up on the scene, I'm putting it very simply, but when Israel showed
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.280]   up on the scene, everybody's theology got all jacked up.
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.280]   You know why?
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.020]   Wait a minute.
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:30.460]   Is God fulfilling all of these Old Testament prophecies to Israel again?
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:34.800]   Because for 2,000 years, everything was spiritualized.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.360]   Not just as you guys are following this.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:43.840]   So they lost their freedom, they lost their land, they lost their masses of armies.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.200]   Who was known for their armies?
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.200]   USA.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.960]   David, they lost all that and they lost their wealth.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:54.840]   And now they're having to pay what little money they have to like Caesar.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.760]   And this is so sad.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:04.040]   So imagine the United States of America 200 years from now, every single one of our descendants
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.640]   who's living here is a slave.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.160]   That's the equivalent.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.720]   So you guys tracking along?
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.120]   One more time with the poem.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.720]   6, 12.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.160]   Assyria is shelved.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.880]   Judah soon to follow.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.640]   5, 8, 6.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.080]   Temples nixed.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.640]   Jeremiah laments and swallows.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.640]   Now we're at...
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.640]   What did I say?
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.640]   Wallows.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.040]   Jeremiah laments and wallows.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.640]   Now we're looking at the BCD.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.320]   Okay?
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.040]   A, B, King, King split.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.480]   A, B, C, D. Medo, Persians, return and Greeks.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.480]   King, King split.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.980]   A, B, C, D. Medo, Persians, return and Greeks.
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:56.360]   You could probably do the timeline now if I gave you time, right?
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.960]   King, what year?
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.960]   1010.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.960]   King, 970.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.960]   Split.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.200]   930.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.200]   When did Saul become king?
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.200]   1050, because 42, 40, 40.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.200]   Right?
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.200]   Okay?
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.200]   So King, King split.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.200]   A is when?
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.200]   Split, two, 722, split, two.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.200]   What year?
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.200]   722.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.200]   When's B?
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.200]   612.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.200]   Assyria is shelved.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.200]   What's C?
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:21.200]   That period in between.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.200]   It starts to happen.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.200]   600-ish, right?
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.200]   When's D?
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.200]   586.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.200]   Okay?
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.200]   So now you have seven of those dates.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.200]   There's a way to remember that.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.200]   Now, the B, C, D all happens at once, so I'm going to use it conveniently.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.200]   Hey, don't take a picture of this, because I might get sued, right?
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.200]   But you guys know this sign, right?
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.200]   Most of you, if you guys are Asian, you might know this.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.200]   It's the sign for the Greek.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.200]   It's the Greek.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.200]   And it's the sign for the Greek.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.200]   So it's the Greek.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.200]   So it's the Greek.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.200]   It's the Greek.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.200]   So it's the Greek.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.200]   And it's the Greek.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.200]   And it's the Greek.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.200]   So it's the Greek.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.200]   Now, how do you know that?
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   I'm going to use this.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.200]   It's the Greek.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:24:06.200]   So it's the Greek.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:27.200]   So it's the Greek.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:53.200]   So it's the Greek.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.660]   What does that stand for, Temple, Sadie, Proverbs, teacher.
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:00.860]   So, it's an acronym, and another way to say acronym is HEADS.
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.240]   So, what books?
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:08.960]   Remember, we JAMN, but with BCD, what should you remember?
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:15.240]   The HEADS of these four books, and + Jeremiah Lamentations.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:26.840]   First book, Habakkuk, second one, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zephaniah, and they're not necessarily
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:27.840]   in order.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.520]   Okay, so when I'm, the we JAMN is pretty much in order.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:36.080]   These HEADS are similar in time, not necessarily similar in order.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:47.520]   So, HEADS, Habakkuk, Ezekiel, Daniel, Zephaniah, but there's a bunch of H books and Z books,
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.520]   right?
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.160]   There's also Zachariah, there's Haggai, there's Hosea.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:56.800]   So how do you remember which H this is, and which Z this is?
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.680]   I'll give you a little hint.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.480]   What's that?
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.260]   It's a sundubu, right?
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:06.360]   Is it spicy or not spicy?
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.240]   It's botong.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.660]   This is a spicy one.
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:17.200]   If you can't handle the heat, and you start eating this stuff, what happens to your body?
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.520]   And then usually that restaurant is enclosed, so you start getting sweaty, okay?
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.520]   What gets sweaty?
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.080]   Your back gets sweaty.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.360]   Habakkuk, okay?
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.000]   So what happens when your back gets sweaty?
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   What do you need to do yourself?
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   Fan.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.360]   I don't know how else to remember it.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.820]   Just use my tools, okay?
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:38.700]   So does it make sense?
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.420]   Does this help?
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:41.420]   Yes, it does.
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.860]   Okay, so just remember it this way.
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:51.100]   6, 12, Assyria is shelved.
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.340]   Judah soon to follow.
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.580]   What's the next date?
[00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:55.580]   586.
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.580]   Temples nixed.
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.020]   Jeremiah laments and wallows.
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:07.340]   So for the BCD period, there are actually 6 books that you need to remember.
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.940]   What are those 6?
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:14.340]   Jeremiah lamentations, and then these heads, okay?
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:26.020]   Habakkuk, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zechariah?
[00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.500]   No.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.100]   What's that Z book?
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.580]   Zephaniah, okay?
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.060]   So just remember it this way.
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:38.460]   Then we're going to cover some of these books, and then after some of these books, we'll
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:43.660]   take a little bit of a break.
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:48.860]   This is Ezekiel, all right?
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:56.420]   So Ezekiel, if you just look at him, he's a skeleton with an easy towel.
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:07.620]   And this is the dry bones will come to life is the thing that is focused on here, okay?
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:16.460]   In Ezekiel chapter 37, God says, "Prophesy, son of man, come to life, dead dry bones."
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:22.220]   So these bones that had been buried for a long time, and dry bones are bones that are
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.660]   like literally...
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.060]   Is that thunder or is that someone up there?
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:31.060]   Oh, that's crazy.
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.060]   Nice.
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.060]   Okay.
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:38.700]   So whoever's watching the video is going to be like, "What's going on?"
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.700]   What was I talking about?
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:40.700]   Ezekiel, the dry bones.
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.460]   Okay, Ezekiel 37.
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.260]   So he asks, "Can these dry bones come to life?"
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.860]   And Ezekiel says, "No."
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:56.340]   When I was in college, I went to Berkeley and we had a little pier at the Berkeley Marina,
[00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.460]   and then we went fishing, my friend and I, we went fishing.
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.340]   And I ended up pulling up a five-foot shark, okay?
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.620]   A seven-gill shark.
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.140]   It was five feet.
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.740]   And then we decided to try to eat it.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.100]   I almost died after I ate it because it was toxic.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:13.540]   But he took the head home, okay?
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:20.300]   He took the head home and then he left it actually in a bag in the garage of the apartment
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.340]   building.
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.580]   And it just...
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:28.380]   And then he went down there having forgotten about this shark head because what he wanted
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.820]   was the teeth.
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:34.380]   So he had just left it there because we spent all night fishing and then he...
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.380]   Like a week later, he actually went to the shark head and it was nasty.
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.260]   It smelled so bad.
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:43.580]   So eventually, because he wanted the teeth, he cleaned it off and then he boiled it to
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:44.840]   get all the meat off.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:52.180]   So he ended up with the skull of the shark.
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:30:01.620]   Now that shark skeleton now, even more so, it's even deader now, right?
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:06.260]   This was back in 1998, but now it's been 20 plus years.
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:11.580]   If we try to reconstruct this shark with these jaw bones, would that work?
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:15.100]   No, it's an impossible thing.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:20.300]   But in the book of Ezekiel, God is saying, "I am going to raise up these dry bones.
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:25.020]   They're gonna be a powerful army and they are going to be instruments in my hands."
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:27.580]   Immediate context, that happens.
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:35.780]   But the nation of Israel itself is described in the book of Ezekiel.
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:39.340]   Israel coming back in 1945 should never have happened.
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:43.460]   That's an impossible thing, that they would become a country again.
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:48.280]   So Ezekiel is about dry bones coming back to life.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.300]   And that's why Ezekiel is hard to understand because there's so many different prophecies
[00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:55.380]   going on about immediate context and the end times.
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:59.100]   So Ezekiel is about dry bones coming to life.
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.100]   What's lamentation is about?
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:05.180]   Grieving and weeping over Judah's losses.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:08.180]   And what did they lose?
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:09.180]   Freedom?
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.780]   Law, flaw.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:11.780]   Land?
[00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:12.780]   Arms?
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:13.780]   Wealth.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:14.780]   They lost everything.
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:21.300]   So if you go to the New Testament, are the Jews idol-phobic or idol lovers?
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.300]   They hate idols.
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.420]   Did you ever think about that?
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.980]   In the Old Testament, they're like always getting in trouble because they're dancing
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.380]   around idols and stuff.
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:31.300]   In the New Testament, they're so strict.
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.300]   What happened?
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.300]   They learned their lesson finally.
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.420]   Okay, that's lamentations.
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:40.500]   Ezekiel is about dry bones coming to life.
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.260]   Daniel.
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:49.140]   If you look at the picture, this Daniel in the lion's den, it's one easy way to remember.
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:54.860]   And this whole book really is about dreams and visions.
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:58.020]   Dreams and visions.
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:02.900]   Ezekiel was about dry bones coming back to life, which is a description of what he's
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:07.460]   going to do in the New Testament to all Christians because he's going to give us, take away our
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:08.980]   heart of what?
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.460]   Stone, and put in our hearts a heart of?
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.460]   Flesh.
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.140]   He's going to put a new spirit in us.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.700]   And it also says in Jeremiah.
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:22.980]   But in context of the nation of the people of God, they're going to come back to life.
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.020]   Daniel is about dreams and visions.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.860]   And what are these visions?
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.300]   So this picture is different from the one that I put it on the paper for you, and I
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:32.300]   did that on purpose.
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:35.220]   But it has basically the same thing.
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.220]   Slightly different wording.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:42.000]   So Daniel 2.1, in the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.460]   His mind was troubled, and he could not sleep.
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:51.060]   So and he dreams a bit of this statue that has a head of gold.
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:58.620]   He has a chest and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, feet of iron
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:05.720]   and clay, and a little rock comes and destroys this statue.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.160]   And these all stand for something.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:13.500]   On your paper, it'll say that the head of gold is Babylon.
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.820]   What's the chest and arms of silver?
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:22.380]   The Medo-Persian alliance that comes and knocks out Babylon.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:27.300]   Belly and thighs of bronze, ancient Greeks.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.300]   Legs of iron.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:33.060]   Did you guys know Rome was actually known for their iron?
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.260]   Legs of iron, what is that?
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.380]   It should be all on your paper.
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:38.920]   That's Rome.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.700]   Legs of iron and clay also revitalized Rome.
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:48.380]   Some people think that has to do with the Roman church in the early period.
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:50.640]   Some people say it's Europe.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:55.840]   But either way, the feet of iron and clay is debated.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:07.220]   But this little rock that comes and knocks everything down is the kingdom of God.
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:13.700]   Daniel has a vision, you guys still looking at it?
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:28.400]   It should be very similar to what's on that picture.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.060]   If you just Google this, you'll find these images.
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.220]   You'll find all kinds of different images.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:37.820]   So I got this from Google.
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.820]   I'm moving on.
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:45.200]   And then in chapter 7, Daniel has a vision.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:50.540]   So in the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, this is many, many years later.
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:53.660]   This is after King Nebuchadnezzar goes crazy.
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:35:01.380]   But Belshazzar, his great grandson, Daniel had a dream.
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:05.420]   And visions passed through his mind as he was lying on his bed.
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.060]   And he wrote down the substance of his dreams.
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:11.540]   So it was about 40 years later.
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.380]   Belshazzar has a vision.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:18.340]   Okay, that animation was kind of lame.
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:23.140]   But he has a vision of these four creatures.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.140]   Same concept.
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:26.140]   Lying with wings.
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.940]   Babylon.
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.400]   Okay?
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:34.680]   The bear is twisted at one side.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:40.140]   Where one side is more dominant and stronger than the other.
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:45.540]   The Medo-Persian alliance, you end up actually hearing more about Persia than Mede.
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:46.540]   Right?
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:52.820]   Because before we learned the king-king split here, Medo-Persia, what is that?
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:53.820]   Okay?
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:54.980]   Persia is what you know.
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:59.300]   But the Medes were there to help the Persian empire knock out Babylon.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.980]   But it's a little bit of a lopsided bear.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:04.860]   Okay?
[00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:08.420]   And then the leopard is Greece.
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:12.340]   And then that beast is Rome.
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:17.380]   So in your Bibles, a lot of times, if there's a little title section, it'll usually just
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:22.580]   say the Babylonian empire in the visions.
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.100]   Nod your heads if you guys have noticed that before.
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.220]   Yeah?
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:34.280]   And then a third vision that Daniel sees is Daniel chapter 7, verses 13 to 14.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:37.540]   And on your paper, I actually wrote the verses out.
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:43.440]   It's basically he sees a vision of heaven, and the son of man, who is what Jesus always
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:50.820]   calls himself in the New Testament, son of God, son of man, this is second Adam, he comes
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:57.420]   and he sees this son of man getting all the authority from God the Father.
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.580]   And that's the vision that he sees.
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:07.460]   So those are the three main contextual visions that you have in the book of Daniel.
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:13.060]   But then chapters 6 through 12 in the book of Daniel are crazy, because it's all about
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:16.020]   the book of...or the end times.
[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:20.620]   Lamentations, what is that book about?
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:24.820]   Losses and mourning the losses of Judah.
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.820]   And what were those losses?
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:31.740]   Freedom, land, arms, wealth.
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.580]   What's Ezekiel about?
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:37.260]   Dry bones coming back to life, an impossible feat.
[00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.900]   What is Daniel about?
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.140]   This is the last major prophet.
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.140]   What's Daniel about?
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.140]   Dreams and visions.
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:51.820]   And the three visions are the statue, beasts, son of man.
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:53.020]   Got it?
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:58.820]   So what we've done, 5-12, 5-5-12, 5-12, 5-5-12.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:01.000]   We haven't heard this in a while, right?
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.260]   It's been a whole one week, okay?
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:04.940]   5-12, 5-5-12.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:11.700]   So you have the Pentateuch, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges,
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:20.020]   Ruth, 1st and 2nd, Samuel, 1st Kings, 2nd Kings, 1st and 2nd Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah,
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.020]   Esther.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:26.860]   And then last week we covered the poems, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Solomon.
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:33.140]   And there are four major prophets, but we stick Lamentations in there to make it five.
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:40.940]   Isaiah, Jeremiah, and today Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, but we'll get there,
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:41.940]   okay?
[00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:55.740]   So, so far what we covered today, 6-12, Assyria is shelved, Judah soon to follow, 5-8-6, temples
[00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:04.580]   nixed, Jeremiah laments and wallows, and what are the six prophecies that are about BCD?
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.100]   Not just four, but includes Jeremiah Lamentations.
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:17.940]   Jeremiah Lamentations, Habakkuk, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zephaniah.
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.340]   Got it?
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:24.420]   And what did Jeremiah lament in Lamentations?
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:27.600]   The loss of everything.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.940]   And what caused those losses?
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:38.500]   And they lost fame, paying attention to some people.
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.500]   Some of you guys looked so mad.
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:49.700]   No, freedom, land, arms, wealth, everything that is at all valuable or priceless, they
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:50.980]   lost.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:56.780]   But Ezekiel says, the impossible is gonna happen, you're gonna gain it all back, right?
[00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:01.340]   Just as much as it's impossible for dry bones to come back to life, Israel's gonna stand
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:08.340]   again, according to one theological perspective, okay?
[00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:13.220]   Our church believes that God still has a plan for the nation of Israel, okay?
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:18.900]   So the debates a lot of times are out of texts from Ezekiel, Daniel, Zechariah, and Revelation,
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:19.900]   and Romans 9-11.
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:21.860]   So those are things that, just to be aware of.
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:25.700]   Ezekiel, the valley of dry bones, they're gonna rise up again.
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:28.220]   Daniel, Lamentations, Ezekiel.
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:31.100]   What's Daniel about?
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:39.180]   Dreams and visions about the context in their immediate future context, as well as the kingdom
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:40.500]   of God that is to come.
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:46.540]   Those three visions are Nebuchadnezzar's first vision is about the golden...or the statue,
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:48.380]   okay?
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:56.640]   Israel, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:03.160]   And you actually see all of those in the Old and New Testament together, do we not?
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:12.020]   You see the statue, Daniel sees a vision of the four beasts, and then the Son of Man,
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:15.140]   who is also that little rock that comes and crumbles everything.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.820]   So next time you read the book of Daniel, and you're like, "Dude, chapters 1-3 are awesome
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.820]   'cause these are stories I'm familiar with," and then later when he's an old man, he gets
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:24.720]   thrown into the lion's den, great!
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:29.180]   But what is all this other stuff of these visions and things?
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:31.460]   Now you know, okay?
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:35.860]   Some of it is still yet future, all right?
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:49.740]   So one more time, 6-12, Assyria is shelved, Judah soon to follow, 5-8-6, temples nixed,
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.420]   Jeremiah laments and wallows.
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:55.100]   Who else laments and wallows a little bit?
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:42:03.140]   Habakkuk, Ezekiel, Daniel, Zephaniah.
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.820]   Who's jamming?
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.020]   We are, right?
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.020]   Okay.
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:19.900]   War, Elijah, Elisha, Assyria, Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, Nahum, Jonah, Nahum
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.300]   are about who?
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.660]   The destruction of?
[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:28.260]   A. BCD, Babylon, captivity, destruction of the temple.
[00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.460]   How many years were they captive?
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:34.860]   70, because they didn't let the land rest for 490 years.
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.180]   Bokchang-dong, right?
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:38.180]   Those are heads, okay?
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:48.540]   Now you remember, Jeremiah lamentations, Habakkuk, Ezekiel, Daniel, Zephaniah.
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:43:02.820]   6-12, Assyria is shelved, Judah soon to follow, 5-8-6, temples nixed, Jeremiah laments and
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:03.820]   wallows.
[00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:10.860]   Let's take a little time to just do a little review with each other.
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:14.580]   Now we're doing like test style, okay?
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:23.100]   Find a partner, review, and then we'll take a break till about 11.25.
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:34.100]   Find a partner.
