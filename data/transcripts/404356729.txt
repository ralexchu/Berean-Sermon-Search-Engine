[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680]   All right, good morning.
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.120]   As you can see up here, for the kids, what is this?
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.440]   I went all the way to Jerusalem to get one of these so I can use this as a prop, or I
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.440]   went outside and just ruined one of our trees.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.640]   Today is Palm Sunday, and the reason why it's called Palm Sunday is because this is the
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:36.600]   day that we remember Christ coming into Jerusalem and preparing his last day that he may go
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.320]   be crucified on the cross on Friday.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.120]   It's called Palm Sunday because the crowds were shaking the palm branches and laying
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.680]   it on the ground for the path that Jesus was taking along with the cloak.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.920]   And so I'll explain the meaning behind the Palm Sunday during the sermon, but this is
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.000]   why it's up here.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.080]   It's just to remind us of what day it is today.
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.480]   The text that I want to jump off of, I'm actually going to be going back and forth through the
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.600]   four different texts in the Gospels.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.760]   As I mentioned last week, the feeding of the 5,000 is the only two of miracles that are
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.360]   mentioned in the four Gospels, but the triumphal entry, again, not as a miracle, but as an
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.040]   event of Christ is mentioned in all four Gospels because of the significance behind it.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.720]   I'm going to be reading from Luke chapter 19, verse 28 to verse 37, and then I'll pray
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.720]   and then we'll jump in.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.880]   "After he had said these things, he was going on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.160]   When he approached Bethphage and Bethany near the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.920]   of his disciples saying, 'Go into the village ahead of you.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.400]   There, as you enter, you will find a cold tide on which no one yet has ever sat.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.520]   Untie it and bring it here.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.560]   If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?'
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.380]   you shall say to them, 'The Lord has need of it.'
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.920]   So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.160]   As they were untying the colt, its owner said to them, 'Why are you untying the colt?'
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.560]   They said, 'The Lord has need of it.'
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.000]   They brought it to Jesus and they threw their coats on the colt and put Jesus on it.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.920]   As he was going, they were spreading their coats on the road.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.040]   As soon as he was approaching near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.920]   the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles which
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.760]   they had seen.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.800]   Let's pray.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.220]   Gracious Father, we pray that you would ordain this time that your word would go forth.
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.100]   We pray that you would make our hearts fertile.
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.400]   May our years be leaned toward you.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.580]   Lord, we desire to meet you.
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.480]   We desire to have greater conviction, Lord God, of your presence in our lives.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.440]   We pray that the worship that we give, the offering, the time that we spend, Father God,
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.080]   diving into your word would cause us to be better prepared for what we will celebrate
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.080]   this week.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.080]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.080]   Amen.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.000]   You know, as you know, all the craziness that's going on, I don't know about you, but I've
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.560]   been watching the brief that the president and the doctors have been giving each day.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.840]   In the middle of the day they would give the latest numbers, how it's spreading, what's
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.840]   going on with the economy.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.280]   And obviously if you watch the news, there's a lot of things going on that's changing every
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.480]   single day.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.000]   But along with that, I think every single one of us, the reason why we are eager to
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.720]   hear from the leaders is because we want to see how they are directing us.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.920]   And a lot of times our anxieties or our comfort may directly come to what kind of confidence
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.160]   we have of our leadership.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.920]   So if you happen to have no confidence in the leadership, then you're probably more
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.400]   anxious than other people because every decision that's being made, you're going to be questioning
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   them.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   Why are they doing that?
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.080]   Are they just doing it for the political gain?
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.680]   Whatever news that may be coming out, do I trust these people?
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.620]   Do they care about us?
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:22.040]   How we feel at this time in our anxiety level, in many ways is directly tied to who we trust.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:29.540]   I remember when I was young, the only person that I felt comfortable when I was driving,
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.520]   not driving, when I was at passenger side, where I felt comfortable enough to fall asleep
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.200]   was my older brother.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.640]   For whatever reason, whether it was my friends or whether it was my parents, I would always
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.360]   get anxious and as soon as I started falling asleep, I would jolt right back up because
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.560]   in my mind I imagined something's going to happen.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.800]   And I never felt comfortable.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.800]   But for whatever the reason, whenever my older brother drove, I felt comfortable and I would
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.800]   just pass out.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.920]   I'm in good hands.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.480]   And I think part of the reason why I felt that way is because when I was a little kid,
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:08.880]   my older brother was the one who, like in the neighborhood, whatever bullies that there
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.680]   were in the neighborhood wouldn't touch me because they were afraid of my older brother.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.680]   So I was able to roam around freely in the neighborhood because they say, "Oh, that's
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.680]   Paul."
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.520]   Or he had a Korean name at that time, but that's Paul's younger brother.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.200]   And so I'm thinking maybe that's the reason, since I was a young kid, that I just felt
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.680]   more comfortable in my brother's hands.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.000]   But right now, and again, who do we feel confident?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Who's our leader?
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.120]   Obviously, we've been talking about Jesus' identity, right?
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.280]   He's the great I am.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.880]   And each one of the I am statements are trying to correct and to redirect the direction of
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.720]   the nation of Israel.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.360]   Is he simply a means to where we truly find refuge?
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.920]   If our refuge is financial security, then we're praying now to Jesus that our primary
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:07.240]   concern is that he would make our business stable, that I'd be able to find a good job,
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.480]   that none of our kids would get sick.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.320]   And we are clinging to Christ because he's the means to get to that goal, whatever that
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.440]   goal may be.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:23.280]   But the I am statements are redirecting us, saying that ultimately he is the goal.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.200]   Sometimes the hardships in our lives are brought to us so that we may come to recognize that
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.880]   whatever brings us to him is the means.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.560]   Sometimes they're good stuff.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.040]   Sometimes it's events like this that causes us to see him in a different light.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.240]   Well, today, it's one thing for Jesus to say who he is.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.600]   It's another thing to observe it.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.600]   And I think when we look at Jesus' last week of his life, every part of it reveals a certain
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.840]   aspect of his character.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.200]   And I think this triumphal entry really highlights, to me, the love of Christ.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.000]   We know that God is holy, and we also know that the Bible says that he is love.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.880]   It's one thing to imagine what his love looks like.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.840]   It's another thing to actually see it.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.160]   So what I want to do this morning is highlight the three different aspects of love, God's
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.520]   love that we can observe through this Palm Sunday.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.600]   So if you look at the outline, there's three outlines, and then you'll see in the outline
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.880]   it says, "God is," and then I left it blank, okay, so that you guys can just know that
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.880]   this is what we're going through.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.480]   So there's three things that we're going to be dealing with, and the first thing that
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:37.280]   I want us to pay attention to is God's love is deliberate.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.760]   It's deliberate.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.640]   Why is this so significant?
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.880]   Because everything that happens this day, in fact, everything that happens in Jesus'
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:52.560]   life, but in particular this day, was carefully calculated.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:59.040]   In Zechariah 9, 9, which is the passage that all the four Gospels quote, because Jesus
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:04.640]   tells his disciples to go and get the donkey so that he can ride it in, and the significance
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:10.080]   behind that was the whole nation of Israel knew that when the Messiah came that he was
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.140]   going to be riding in on a donkey.
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:17.360]   So up to this point, Jesus was telling everyone, "It's not time, it's not time."
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.800]   And so he might say it in private, he might tell his disciples, but he didn't publicly
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.360]   announce that this is who he is.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:29.960]   So for the first time, for the first time he's making a public declaration just in
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:37.600]   case there was any doubt to his identity, he gets them to get this colt and he was going
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.760]   to ride on it.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.360]   But it wasn't just a random colt that he found on the street.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.800]   He told his disciples to go to a very specific place.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.440]   And then if the owner says, "What are you doing?"
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.360]   Tell him the master needs of it, and he said, "That's all it took."
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.640]   He didn't say, "Well, what master?
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.640]   For what purpose?
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.600]   Who's going to pay me for this?"
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.920]   The reason why the owner of this colt was going to say, "Okay," because it was prepared
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.920]   ahead of time.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.240]   And we don't know if Jesus went there ahead physically, we don't know if an angel visited
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.440]   him, we don't know if there was some prophecy over his family's life, all of his life saying,
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.440]   "You know what?
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.680]   We're going to be the family of this colt, and the Messiah's going to raise this colt.
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.000]   That's why nobody can ride it."
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.800]   We don't know.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.960]   We don't know how it happened, but what we do know that it was prepared, even the donkey
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.200]   that he was going to ride was prepared.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.680]   In Zechariah 99, it says, "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.760]   Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.040]   Behold, your king is coming to you.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:39.480]   He is just and endowed with salvation, humble and mounted on a donkey, even on a colt, the
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.360]   foal of a donkey."
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:49.840]   But you know, this prophecy that took place over 500 years before Jesus came was prophesied
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.520]   way before that, all the way up to Genesis chapter 49, verse 11.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.360]   There was a prophecy about the king of Israel, and this is what he says.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.960]   He ties his foal to the vine, and his donkey colt to the choice vine.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:08.600]   He washes his garments in wine, and his robes in the blood of grapes.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:16.040]   Now here clearly we see the colt that it prophesied way before even Zechariah prophesied, but
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:21.000]   it goes a little bit further how his robe is going to be in blood of grapes, clearly
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.400]   pointing to the blood that he was going to shed.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:32.840]   Not only that, in Mark chapter 10, 33-34, everything that happens this week was carefully
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:38.000]   designed and planned, saying, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.320]   Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.600]   to death, and will hand him over to the Gentiles.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:52.200]   They will mock him and spit on him and scourge him and kill him, and three days later he
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.840]   will rise again."
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.280]   Every one of these things that he prophesies is found somewhere also in the Old Testament.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.000]   It wasn't just coming out of Jesus' mouth.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.840]   Jesus is saying, "I'm going to fulfill all of these prophecies."
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:12.200]   God, Jesus didn't come on a donkey and all of a sudden the people betrayed him, and then
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:18.520]   he didn't find a good place to hide, so the leaders came early in the morning, crucified
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:25.080]   him, his disciples scattered, and against his will he was dragged to the cross.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:29.960]   That is not how the Bible portrays what happens this week.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:38.240]   Even to the betrayal of Judas, to the beating, to the crown that he wears, to the Roman soldier
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:44.560]   spitting, even the spear on his side with the blood and the water gushing out, even
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:50.600]   to the place where he was buried, scattering of his disciples, every part of that the Bible
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.120]   prophesies that it was going to happen.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:12:00.480]   In fact, the Bible says there's over 100 prophecies that Jesus fulfilled, over 100.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.080]   You see, the book of Ephesians chapter 1, as we're studying through the book of Ephesians,
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:11.400]   the first chapter lays the foundation of God's predestination, adoption, election of us.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:18.280]   If you read chapter 1, there is a theme that is repeated over and over and over.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.160]   You may have caught it, you may not have caught it when you were studying through it, but
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:28.400]   the theme that he repeats over and over in Ephesians chapter 1, it was all his doing,
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.680]   his will.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.040]   Let me just read you a couple of verses, Ephesians 1, 5.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.440]   He predestined us to adoption.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:40.960]   He predestined us, meaning he planned it and he fulfilled it, as sons through Jesus Christ
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.320]   to himself, according to the kind intentions of his will.
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:51.400]   Verse 6, to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.400]   name of his beloved.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:58.760]   The theme of he did it, he planned it, he willed it, he purposed it, over and over again.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:03.160]   Again in verse 11, also we have obtained an inheritance having been predestined according
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:08.600]   to his purpose, who works all things after the counsel of his will.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:15.480]   So if you go back and read chapter 1, if there is one theme above God's election, he predestined,
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.640]   he did all of that, it's he did it.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.720]   It was his purpose.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.720]   He planned it.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.720]   He executed it.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:29.120]   Every part of our salvation was carefully crafted and carried out.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:35.560]   But what we need to understand is, prophecy in the Bible isn't God looking down the road
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:40.000]   and looking at a crystal ball and saying, "Oh, okay, that's what's going to happen."
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.200]   That's not what prophecy is.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.760]   Not the biblical sense of prophecy.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:50.720]   He's not telling the fortune of each individual or the history of mankind that he looked down
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.640]   at the end times and he said, "Oh, that's what's going to happen," and then he wrote
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.640]   that down.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.220]   Now, that's what John did.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:03.640]   When God revealed to him the end times, John took what he saw and he put it down on paper.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.660]   But that's not God.
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:10.960]   When the Bible talks about God prophesying or telling us what's coming, it's because
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.000]   he's going to fulfill it.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.800]   He's telling us his will.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:20.960]   Now, the problem, the difference between us and God is, I can tell you, like today, we're
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:26.640]   going to be having a meeting at 1 p.m. and at 1 p.m. we're going to have certain things.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.760]   We're going to pray for certain things.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.020]   We're going to inform you of certain things.
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:34.080]   But I can't guarantee you 100% that's going to happen.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.280]   I mean, there's good odds that's going to happen because I don't know if I can make
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.680]   it on the way home, something might happen.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.240]   I don't know if Zoom is going to break down.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.000]   I don't know if this meeting is too big and there's too many people showing up, if it's
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.600]   going to work properly.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.200]   I don't know if the mics are going to work.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.680]   I don't know if the power outage is going to happen.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.860]   I could look at that and say, "I'm hoping that it'll happen.
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.640]   We're planning that it'll happen."
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:04.600]   But only God can say something's going to happen and it happens 100% because he is able
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.600]   to do that.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:11.760]   So every prophecy of the Bible, when we talk about fulfilled prophecy, all it is is God
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.680]   making sure that when it happens, it's him.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:23.160]   That we see what is happening and we recognize this was God's plan all along.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.560]   This is not happening randomly.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.240]   Things are not out of control.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:33.160]   Jesus' death and crucifixion wasn't out of his hand.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:38.800]   Jesus actually says in John 10, 17 to 18, "For this reason, the Father loves me because
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.200]   I lay down my life so that I may take it again.
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.880]   No one has taken it away from me, but I lay it down on my initiative.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.760]   I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it up.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.440]   This commandment I receive from my Father."
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.120]   He said, "No.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.040]   Yes, I am going to be crucified by the hands of the Gentiles.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.320]   I will be handed over by the leaders of Israel.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:09.400]   I will be mocked and I will be forsaken by my own people."
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.400]   But Jesus says, "No.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.800]   Ultimately, it is I who lay down my life and it is I who take it back up."
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:21.720]   So when we see the prophecies being fulfilled, we have to look at that as when you look at
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:27.440]   fine art, one of the first things that they always look for is authentication.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:32.800]   If Picasso is the painter, they want to make sure that his signature is there, that it
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.120]   matches up with all the other things that he has done.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.360]   And so when they match it up, it could be worth a few bucks if it's an imitation or
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:47.160]   it could be worth a million dollars depending on the authentication of the author or the
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.820]   person who painted this picture.
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.760]   Prophecy is fulfilled in the same way.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.180]   When we see it being fulfilled, we recognize God purposed this.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.520]   This is what he said he was going to do.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.200]   This is what he said how he was going to do it.
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:07.480]   And then when he actually does it, the purpose of that is, "Ah, it's him.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.680]   He's the one we've been waiting for.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.920]   He said he was going to come on the donkey."
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.600]   Ultimately, it was not Zachariah.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.040]   It was not Moses.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:22.280]   Zachariah and Moses was only looking at the vision that God gave them and was writing
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.480]   that down.
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.580]   Ultimately, it was God himself who said to Moses, who said to Zachariah, who said to
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:37.040]   Isaiah, "I am coming, and when you see these things being fulfilled, you know it was me."
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.440]   In fact, there's so many prophecies about the last week of Jesus.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.040]   Even Psalm chapter 22, it is a messianic passage.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.420]   It's about David crying out to God for his suffering.
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.900]   But the Jews commonly understood this as a messianic suffering.
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:56.680]   But if you look at and study that passage carefully, it is the Messiah, Jesus hanging
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:01.780]   on the cross, and the vision that he has on the cross.
[00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:06.660]   Even his very moment of suffering was prophesied in the book of Psalms hundreds and hundreds
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.140]   of years before.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.740]   Now why do I say all of this?
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:20.800]   Because God did not simply, randomly choose to come and save us.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.200]   From the beginning of our fall, God made a plan.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.480]   He said, "This is what I'm going to do.
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.640]   The seed of the woman is going to crush the head of the serpent, and then he's going to
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:37.800]   raise up Israel, that they may receive the law, that they may shine God, establish the
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:45.280]   tribes, and have the prophets prophesy in every little detail of his birth, his life,
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.720]   his disciples, his suffering, his rejection, his resurrection.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:56.760]   All of it, he planned, and then he devised it, and then he fulfilled it.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:02.180]   Now why does this show us about God's love?
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:08.700]   Because the only answer to why he did that is because he loved us.
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.820]   That will always remain a mystery.
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.820]   Why?
[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:18.500]   I think one of the clearest pictures that we have of this love of God is adoption.
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.980]   I'm very encouraged that there's many families in our church who are praying, and many of
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.660]   you are in the process of adopting.
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:30.900]   The people who got caught right in the middle of this, some of you guys were waiting, maybe
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.460]   in a few more months you'll get news, you'll be able to go out to Korea and different parts
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:39.580]   of the world possibly and pick up your children, but now you have to wait.
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.660]   Even just a few months is a long time.
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:48.700]   I remember when my own family, with Philip and Mary, and now they prayed and waited eagerly,
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:54.060]   and now they longed and was eager to pick a belly.
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:58.220]   The difference between an adoption and birth, and obviously every child is precious, but
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.500]   an adopted child was planned.
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:09.300]   An adopted child had to save up a lot of money, had to pray, had to talk to family and friends,
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.340]   and they had to wait.
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:15.940]   You could see the anticipation not only of the parents, but the friends and extended
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:22.340]   families, just eagerly waiting because this child is so adored and loved even before he
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.460]   ever lives in the house.
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:32.660]   That's the picture, that is pictured for us in the scripture about our adoption.
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:37.240]   He didn't randomly come in and we were born and all of a sudden he recognized something
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.180]   good in us and then said, "You know what, I'm going to, he's cute, she's cute, he has
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.500]   potential, she has potential."
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:52.620]   No, the scripture tells us from the beginning, God planned to come and get us.
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.220]   That's what this triumphal entry is.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.020]   He's coming to get us.
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:02.380]   He didn't plan this a couple of weeks before, he didn't plan this when he told the owner
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.020]   of the cult to get ready.
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:14.180]   From the book of Genesis, the Bible tells us he planned and now he's fulfilling it.
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:19.300]   Every single one of us, when danger hits us, the first thing we do is how can we avoid
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.460]   this danger?
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.020]   That's why when this thing first broke out, like when are we going to go home?
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.780]   We got to protect our children.
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.260]   Many of us ran and saying, "Oh, they're going to run out of toilet paper."
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.300]   We have to have toilet paper, so we stocked up on that.
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:37.260]   What if the supermarket shut down and we need to have food, so we stocked up on that.
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.140]   At least a lot of us did.
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.580]   We purchased properties based upon the crime.
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:47.460]   Part of the reason why Irvine is so popular and expensive is because they have low crime
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:52.940]   rate and parents can send their kids to public school and feel safe.
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.480]   That's our natural inclination.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:00.660]   Every decision that we make, we make based upon how is this going to bring more safety
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.340]   and security.
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:10.220]   Jesus lived his whole life knowing that he will face danger.
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.700]   He didn't do it for himself.
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.220]   He wasn't a thrill seeker.
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:19.280]   The Bible says he planned and he actually faced the crucifixion.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:24.900]   Every action that he takes this week takes him closer to the cross.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:29.220]   The worst thing that he would do when he enters into Jerusalem is to go to the temple because
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:33.380]   that's where all the leaders who wanted to kill him was hanging out.
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:38.380]   The worst thing that if he did go to the temple was to make a scene and to announce to people
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.560]   that he's there.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.700]   He flips over the tables.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.980]   That's the worst thing.
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:48.160]   If he was a man who was looking for security and safety, first of all, he would have never
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.160]   entered Jerusalem.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.260]   He would have stayed in Galilee, maybe went further out to Turkey.
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:23:02.820]   Instead, every part of his life was intentional and deliberate and executed because God loved
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.580]   us deliberately.
[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.060]   He purposed to love us.
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:12.220]   So Palm Sunday, he's coming in to rescue us.
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:17.260]   Number two, God's love is patient.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.400]   God's love is patient.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:24.500]   It says in Luke chapter 1941 that Jesus was weeping.
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:29.900]   As he was writing in, you have to understand this scene because there's only two places
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.380]   in the Bible where it's described where Jesus was weeping.
[00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:38.940]   The other time was at Lazarus' burial.
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.840]   Now there's a whole different story behind that which I'm not going to get to today,
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:47.720]   but we can understand, at least superficially, why someone would be crying at a funeral.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:52.000]   But Palm Sunday was a parade.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.360]   In fact, the palm branches that people were waving...
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:00.040]   Since I got my prop, I got to use this one more time.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.560]   The reason why they were waving these palm branches is because the palm branches at that
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.320]   time represented victory.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:13.200]   So usually what they did was when soldiers would go out to battle and they win their
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:18.840]   enemy and the soldiers would march back into town, the people would greet them in celebration
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.300]   with palm branches.
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:28.180]   So when Jesus came into Jerusalem and they were waving the palm branches, they were recognizing
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:34.440]   that somebody powerful was coming into town, that he was going to bring victory.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.660]   It's similar to when soldiers go to war and they come back, or at least you see films
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.680]   of it where they throw confetti.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:46.600]   If we want to celebrate and we're really excited, if we're excited we'll say, "Yay."
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.800]   If you're really excited, you get confetti and throw it.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.800]   You just kind of like...
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.040]   An exuberance.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:56.320]   That's the scene that we see as Jesus is coming down, coming into Jerusalem.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:02.400]   In fact, in the Gospel of Matthew, he said that the crowd was stirred.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.980]   And the word "stirred" in Greek is seismos.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:10.520]   And you could already tell what that word means, is where we get the word seismic, earthquake.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.200]   He said it was that electric.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:18.860]   In fact, this took place during Passover, and by the number of lambs that they have
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:24.040]   record of that was sacrificed at the temple at that time, they believe that the number
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:30.240]   of people that possibly could have been in Jerusalem at that time was over 1.5 million
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.240]   people.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:37.360]   I don't think it was 1.5 million people greeting Jesus, but this was not any normal crowd.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.400]   This is probably the biggest crowd that Jesus has seen.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.720]   And they were all elated.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:46.600]   There were rumors about Jesus raising Lazarus, it was a very prominent family.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:51.240]   And even the leaders wanted to shush that.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.240]   They were concerned.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:58.460]   I mean, this man just raised Lazarus, how are we going to get rid of this guy now?
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:05.320]   So you can imagine the electricity, and yet, right in the middle of that, we see Jesus
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.320]   weeping.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.380]   You know what's interesting to me when I read that?
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:13.860]   Is that there is no explanation, there's no description of the disciples coming to Jesus
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.100]   and asking, "What are you doing?
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.100]   Why are you weeping?"
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.020]   Look at these people, they're crying out.
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.660]   They're so elated.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.660]   I can imagine the disciples were thinking that when they come into Jerusalem, that this
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:25.960]   is what they were going to face.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.420]   And that's why they were constantly asking, "When the kingdom comes, when these people
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:36.040]   finally recognize who you are, like we have, and they come and they make you king, who's
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.760]   going to sit on the left and who's going to sit on the right?"
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:43.100]   I'll bet you the disciples were elated over this.
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.600]   And there's no description, there's no mention of this, of the disciples like, "What is he
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.600]   doing?
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.600]   Why is he weeping?"
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.900]   It wasn't until later.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:57.060]   After everything was done, Jesus was resurrected, maybe after the ascension, Jesus cried.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.220]   Remember when Jesus cried when he was coming down?
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.220]   Remember?
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.180]   What was that?
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.660]   Just like in any other, they didn't understand, they were too afraid to ask because every
[00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:11.540]   time they asked, Jesus would say, "Why didn't you know?
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.620]   Haven't you been paying attention?
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.600]   I've been telling you this all this time."
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.260]   So my guess is they were probably afraid to ask and it wasn't until after the resurrection
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.940]   they realized Jesus wept.
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:22.700]   That's why we have record of it.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.460]   But it is a strange scene.
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:32.500]   In the midst of probably one of the biggest parade that Israel has seen, Jesus, the one
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.660]   that they were celebrating, was weeping.
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.860]   It's kind of like you're in a birthday party and everybody's singing "Happy Birthday,"
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:43.460]   confetti falling everywhere, and the guy who's supposed to blow out the cake is just weeping.
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:48.260]   And everybody just ignores him because they want the cake.
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.740]   Jesus' delicious cake.
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.780]   This is the best cake that they're going to ever have.
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.380]   So the person that they're celebrating is weeping, but they're just eager to get to
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.500]   the cake.
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.700]   That's what I see here.
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:03.620]   Jesus is weeping, they're not asking what's going on.
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:09.380]   But by his own words, he describes, he says in verse 42 of Luke chapter 19, "If you had
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:14.700]   known in this day, even you, the things which make for peace, now they have been hidden
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:19.500]   from your eyes, for the days will come upon you when your enemies will throw up a barricade
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:23.440]   against you and surround you and hand you on every side.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.100]   And they will level you to the ground and your children within you, and they will not
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:33.460]   leave in you one stone upon another because you did not recognize the time of your visitation."
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:44.660]   I remember years ago, we were coming out of China and one year SARS broke out in China.
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:49.820]   And maybe about a month before we were supposed to go, we got information from our denomination
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.100]   saying, "You guys can't get in there.
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:55.180]   China is not allowing anybody from outside to come in because of this outbreak."
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:29:00.820]   So we ended up scrambling and last minute we ended up going to Romania.
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:04.460]   And so our ministry is different in Romania because we can't speak their language.
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.620]   So we made it into this presentation.
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:11.180]   And at that time, body worship at our church at that time was a big thing.
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:16.260]   So we had some of our ladies and the guys, we'd practice body worship and then we'd give
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.260]   a short sermon.
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.500]   And so we have this skit presentation that we prepared.
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.040]   We were eager to go to Romania.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:26.940]   And I remember the very first church that we went to, our ladies were doing the body
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.180]   worship and give a short testimony.
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:34.060]   And I saw a lady way in the back, and this is probably about a group of about 200 people
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.060]   maybe.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.040]   So it wasn't a tiny church.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.460]   And she was weeping and crying and saying something.
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:44.620]   And the whole time I was thinking, "Wow, she's really touched."
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.420]   She must have, I mean, we can't speak the language, but clearly she understands the
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:49.820]   Holy Spirit and she's weeping.
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.540]   And so after it was over, I went to one of the translators and said, "Hey, I saw that
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:54.540]   old lady crying.
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:55.860]   What was she saying to you?"
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:59.300]   And then he seemed reluctant to tell me.
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.420]   And then I said, "Well, what did he say?"
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.220]   And he's like, "Well, it's not good."
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.940]   So I'm like, "Oh, really?"
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.140]   It was complete opposite of what I was thinking.
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.420]   I said, "What was she saying?"
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:14.420]   She said, "How can they do this in the church?"
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:21.140]   Romania is such a conservative, and we got rebuked for smiling up on the stage in one
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:22.580]   of the churches.
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.060]   And I remember that just deflated everything that I...
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.980]   I was so excited.
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.940]   We had seven more days of this.
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:34.420]   And I couldn't tell our team, because if I told our team, because it was the very first
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.420]   church, like every church we go to, they're going to...
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:37.420]   People hate us.
[00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.420]   But we're going to do it anyway, because we're here, so let's do it.
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:44.100]   I kept it to myself until after it was over, and I told them what happened.
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:49.900]   But it completely deflated everything.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:55.900]   Imagine this party, this huge celebration, and Jesus is saying, "You have no idea what's
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:56.900]   coming."
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:01.180]   They completely missed it.
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:06.900]   What they were seeking and what Jesus was seeing was not just different.
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.300]   It wasn't just off by a couple of degrees.
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.540]   It was going to clash big time.
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:18.780]   And Jesus says, and it's fulfilled in AD 70, that the Romans came in and completely destroyed
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:24.380]   the temple, never to be established again, at least in its glory.
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:28.380]   And Israel, as an official nation, basically disappears.
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:35.140]   Reappears, a couple thousand years later, to fulfill God's promise, but they completely
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:36.780]   missed it.
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:40.060]   You see, God's love is patient.
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.060]   And why?
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:46.820]   If that was the case, and he knew that they were going to reject him, why walk in, knowing
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.340]   what they were going to do?
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:54.260]   Knowing that they would reject him, the very people that he loved and cared for?
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.900]   Jesus weeps over them.
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:03.100]   You know, in Luke chapter 15, Jesus rebukes the Pharisees, and because he was hanging
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.860]   around with sinners, he said, "How can you, if you're a rabbi, how can you be hanging
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:06.860]   around with sinners?"
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:11.220]   And Jesus gives three parables, and the first one is the lost sheep.
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:16.380]   In the lost sheep, you have out of the hundred, one sheep strays, the shepherd goes after
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:20.120]   him and brings him back in celebration.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.740]   And then he has the parable of the lost coin, same thing.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:29.980]   Loses a coin, sweeps the whole house until they find the lost coin, and then they celebrate.
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:34.900]   And then the prodigal son, the lost son, is mentioned.
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:40.140]   But what's different about the lost son is he's not searching.
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.860]   He actually releases him.
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:46.180]   He said, "My life will be so much better, and I know you have money, and that's all
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.180]   I need.
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.380]   Why wait till you die?
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.900]   Can you give it to me now?"
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.840]   The father actually gives him his portion.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:57.900]   He goes out and he squanders it, and it's only when he's living in squalor, he raised
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:02.300]   all of his money and realizes that it would be better to be his father's servant than
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.380]   to be his son.
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:12.940]   So with his tail behind, with his tail under his knees, I forgot what that's...
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:13.940]   Between his legs.
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:17.500]   Okay, I'm a fop.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:25.300]   Tail between his legs, he comes crawling back in, and the father is eagerly waiting, eagerly
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.780]   waiting.
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:32.440]   He sees his son way off in the yonder, and he goes out and grabs him, hugs him, puts
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:37.140]   his cloak back on, puts his slippers back on, and he ran back in and celebrates.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:40.260]   And obviously, the older brother is like, "Man, I've done nothing.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.700]   I didn't do all this, and I don't have this."
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:51.220]   But the point of the whole story is his father released him because the only way to get him
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.420]   was to wait till he comes back.
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:57.920]   I mean, the patience of our God.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.060]   The reason why he didn't reject him is because he knew.
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:07.620]   Even though as he was weeping over them, knowing the judgment that was coming, he knew that
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:13.500]   he had to wait until his resurrection, until they repent to come back to him.
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:19.580]   Isaiah 49, 15 says, "Can a woman forget her nursing child and have no compassion in the
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.540]   son of her womb?
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:26.960]   Even these they may forget, but I will not forget you."
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.300]   That's our God.
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.140]   He's deliberate.
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:32.180]   His love is patient.
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:37.500]   Over and over again, the Bible tells us that he did what he did because he had compassion.
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:42.860]   Matthew 9, 36, "Seeing the people, he felt compassion for them because they were distressed
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.220]   and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd."
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:49.860]   Matthew 14, 14, "When he went ashore, he saw the great crowd, and he had compassion on
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:52.260]   them and had healed their sick."
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.100]   He healed them because he was compassionate.
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:59.660]   Matthew 15, 32, "The feeding of the 5,000, Jesus called his disciples to him and said,
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:04.300]   'I have compassion on the crowd because they have been with me now three days and have
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:10.060]   nothing to eat, and I am unwilling to send them away hungry lest they faint on the way.'"
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.460]   Let me stop right here.
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:16.500]   Just in case any of us thinks that Jesus didn't care whether they ate or not, because Jesus
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:20.800]   said, "You're coming to me because you ate the bread, not because you saw the sign."
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.820]   It wasn't because Jesus didn't care that they were hungry.
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:28.140]   It says he fed them because he was compassionate.
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:35.820]   Their problem was they thought that if they ate, that they've arrived to their destination.
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:38.260]   He was compassionate to the lepers.
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.560]   He was compassionate to the demon-possessed.
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.420]   He was compassionate to the widow.
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.460]   He was compassionate to the two blind men.
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:51.680]   One of my favorite passages in the Bible is Isaiah 42, 3, where Jesus quotes in the synagogue
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.680]   in the beginning of his ministry, and he says, "A bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:01.840]   burning wick he will not extinguish."
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:09.400]   There's nobody more patient than our God, not even your parents.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:16.800]   No amount of love of your husband, your wife, your mother, your father, your best friend
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:21.960]   can be as patient with us as God has been with sinners.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.080]   God's love is deliberate.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.160]   God's love is patient.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:32.400]   Jesus came into Jerusalem knowing he would be rejected, weeping over the sins of his
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.800]   people, and yet he did it anyway.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:42.720]   Third, God's love is powerful.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.760]   When he came in, the people were shouting, "Hosanna."
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.600]   The word "hosanna" literally means to save us.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:53.760]   But what they were yelling was not save us from our sins.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.440]   They were yelling, "Save us from poverty.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:59.360]   Save us from the Roman oppression.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:04.960]   Save us so that we may become the great nation."
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:10.600]   Every Jew greeted each other with "Shalom," just like we say, "Hi, hey, what's up?"
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.000]   Their greeting was "Shalom."
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.560]   And "Shalom" had deep theological meaning behind it.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.480]   It meant peace.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:22.560]   All throughout the Old Testament, we are told that God will bring peace.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.280]   So they quoted this.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.360]   Basically they were saying, "Shalom.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.600]   May God's peace be upon you.
[00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.240]   May God's peace be upon you."
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.400]   Kind of like when somebody sneezes, we say, "God bless you."
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.120]   It was their way of saying, "God bless you.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.120]   God bless you."
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:43.160]   But their idea of blessing was no different than the world, because they did not recognize
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.920]   their sin.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:52.200]   The law that God gave them was to reveal their sins so that sin may become utterly sinful.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.080]   The day we wore it as a badge of honor.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:55.960]   We have the law, so we are special people.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.800]   We are closer to God than you.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.640]   In the midst of all of this, Jesus is weeping.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.200]   He says, "Judgment is coming because you did not know."
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:09.760]   He says, "Only," in verse 42, "if you had known in this day, even you, the things which
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.360]   make for peace."
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:17.000]   Yes, God promised peace when the Messiah came.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.400]   The donkey that he rode to come in signified that peace.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:27.080]   But the peace that they were looking for and the peace that they wanted was on a collision
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.720]   course.
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:35.880]   Jesus says in John 8, 36, "So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed."
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.240]   If the Son makes you free.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:43.080]   But again, their idea of freedom was freedom from tyranny of the Romans.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.240]   And they completely missed the point.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:49.040]   As soon as they realized that Jesus wasn't going to fulfill their longing, they didn't
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.040]   want him as king anymore.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:53.440]   In fact, they needed to get rid of him.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:39:00.040]   And Jesus, during his ministry, made it clear to his disciples, John 14, 27, "Peace I leave
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.040]   with you.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.540]   My peace I give to you.
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.740]   Not as the world gives do I give to you."
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:13.760]   The power of his love, people who are recipients of this love have peace.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.960]   Even in the midst of storm.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.880]   Even if we lose our jobs.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.000]   Even if we get sick.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.920]   Even if we end up dying early.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.980]   We have peace.
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:27.160]   Because we know we're just passing through.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.960]   We're just passing through.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:34.600]   So whatever we miss out on here, it's just temporary anyway.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:41.600]   So the biggest problem that we've had, we've had our own sins, the consequence of our sins,
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.680]   it was crucified on the cross with Jesus Christ.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.280]   And that's what he means when he says, "My peace I give unto you."
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:50.440]   And it's a peace that the world does not understand.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:55.800]   This is a peace that will only come when we have peace with God.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:02.800]   That's why in the Bible, in the New Testament, in the church, the common greeting in the
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:08.400]   New Testament was, "Grace and peace to you."
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:13.720]   As the Jews were saying, "Shalom," the New Testament believers and apostles were saying,
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.720]   "No, shalom."
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.960]   But "charis," grace.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.380]   This shalom is going to come by the grace of God.
[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:24.140]   And that's what he was referring to on the cross, is death and resurrection.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:28.180]   We will never have peace of God until we have peace with God.
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.880]   And that's what Jesus was saying.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.920]   But that peace of God is so powerful.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:42.380]   In Philippians 4, 11-13, Apostle Paul, sitting in prison, possibly, possibly this prison
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:43.840]   sentence may end up in death.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:48.520]   And he says this, "Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content in whatever
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.800]   circumstances I am."
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.480]   Now when he says, "I have learned the secret of being content," he's not talking about
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.520]   deep meditation.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:02.040]   He's not talking about going to woods and focusing on an object and saying, "Meditate
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:06.320]   and tap into your inner self and find peace."
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:13.360]   It wasn't something that he learned from discipleship and going to some school.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.520]   He's talking about his connection with Christ.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:20.000]   "I have learned the secret of being content in every circumstance.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   I know how to get along in humble means," which he is in now.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.960]   "I also know how to live in prosperity," which he used to live.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:32.480]   And many prosperous people were supporting his ministry.
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:37.560]   "In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry,
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.280]   both of having abundance and suffering in need.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:44.280]   I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:47.640]   I bet you many of you who are sports fans know that verse very well.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.880]   "I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.320]   Seth Curry has that on his Philippians 4.13.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.560]   "I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:00.640]   That passage was not about dominating your opponents in the basketball court.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.800]   That's not about CEOs of companies saying that our company is going to dominate this
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.800]   world.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:13.960]   Apostle Paul is talking about finding contentment in Christ that supersedes every other contentment.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:20.200]   So whether the storm comes or whether we are in peace, according to the world, whether
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:27.720]   the pestilence passes us or whether it visits us, whether our business does well or it doesn't
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:34.320]   do well, I have learned the secret of being content, and that's the powerful love of Jesus
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.360]   Christ.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:41.440]   And this is the love that the world cannot understand.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:45.240]   That's why he says, "When we are anxious," in Philippians 4, 6, and 7, "to pray, to come
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:50.400]   to God, be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and suffocation, with thanksgiving,
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:56.280]   let your requests be made known to God, and the peace of God which surpasses all comprehension
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:01.160]   that the world does not understand will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:08.120]   Again, let me read a final passage of encouragement, 2 Corinthians 4, 7-12.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:14.920]   This powerful love of Christ, what it does to people who are completely, completely connected
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.440]   to Christ, anchored in Christ.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:21.920]   Paul says in describing his life after meeting Christ, the secret that he's talking about
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:28.000]   in Philippians, 2 Corinthians 4, 7-12, "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels."
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.080]   In other words, it may seem common.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.120]   It doesn't seem like a big deal.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:36.480]   By the views of the world, earthen vessel.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:43.840]   "So that the surpassing greatness of the power of the will of God and not from ourselves,
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:51.000]   we are afflicted just like everybody else in every way, but we are not crushed."
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.080]   We're perplexed, meaning Apostle Paul doesn't understand everything.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:59.920]   And there's a lot of things that happen in the world that we don't understand either.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:08.840]   Paul says he is perplexed but not in despair, persecuted but not forsaken, struck down but
[00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:14.600]   not destroyed, always caring about in the body the dying of Jesus so that the life of
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:19.200]   Jesus also may be manifested in our body.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:24.400]   For we who live are constantly being delivered over to death for Jesus' sake so that the
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:28.160]   life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:33.080]   So death works in us but life in you.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:36.720]   That's the power of the cross.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:43.920]   God's love is deliberate, God's love is patient, and God's love is powerful.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:51.840]   So I pray that during this season of anxiety and uncertainty that Christ would truly become
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.760]   our anchor.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.560]   I want to introduce this song again.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:59.080]   We sang this last week, but I want to...
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:03.680]   I asked the praise team to sing it one more time because it's such a powerful song.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.200]   It is "Well With My Soul."
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:12.080]   And I ask that when we sing it, that it would truly be our confession.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:16.800]   And I know there's a lot of you who are very anxious because you're at the hospitals and
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:24.640]   you're being exposed to this virus that's going on, the uncertainties of what's happening.
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:29.660]   Some of you just started a business and you're really suffering.
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.400]   You don't know if this is going to make it.
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:35.280]   Some of you, I've been hearing through the grapevine, have been laid off.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:39.000]   And we don't know if it's going to be a furlough, we don't know when this goes back, what the
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.760]   economy's going to look like.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.440]   Right now there's a lot of anxiousness and uncertainty.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.800]   Well, this song, it is "Well With My Soul."
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:53.360]   The man who wrote it, Horatio Spafford, was a man who knew suffering very intimately.
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:59.600]   There was a great fire in Chicago that wiped out his business and he was facing possibly
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.800]   losing everything that he had.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:07.680]   And he planned, after that, he planned a trip with his family or to go and took a boat and
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:12.960]   he sent his family ahead and a great storm came and took out his family.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:16.880]   And only his wife was saved from that.
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:23.080]   I mean, he suffered greatly and he received a letter from his wife and his wife started
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:27.280]   the letter by saying, "Saved alone."
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:31.480]   So you can imagine the pain that this man was in.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:35.560]   He was in a circumstance where he could have easily asked, "Why?
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:36.560]   I've been faithful."
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:43.240]   I mean, he was a man of God and yet why would you do this to me?
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:47.440]   But instead, he was so anchored in Christ.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:54.920]   And so, look at the words that he pens to describe a man who's been affected by God's
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:58.440]   deliberate, patient, and powerful love of Christ.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:04.720]   When peace like a river attendeth my way, when sorrows like sea billows roll, whatever
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:12.120]   my lot, thou hast taught me to say, "It is well, it is well with my soul."
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:19.200]   Verse two, "Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come, let the blessed assurance
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:25.440]   control that Christ has regarded my helpless estate and hath shed his own blood for my
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.800]   soul."
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:31.840]   Verse three, "My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought, my sin not in part but the
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:36.120]   whole is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more.
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:41.760]   Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, oh my soul, it is well, it is well with my soul."
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.520]   Let's pray.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:51.680]   Heavenly Father, we pray that this Palm Sunday, that we would not simply spend it like any
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:48:00.500]   other week, any other Sunday, but help us, Lord God, to join the chorus of millions and
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:06.400]   millions of Christians around the world, remembering what you have done for us.
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:13.000]   I pray, Lord God, that your love would convict us, revive us, renew us, and that through
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.120]   all that is happening now, that you would bring revival, a greater affection for your
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:24.640]   name, greater anchoring toward Christ may result from all of this.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.080]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
