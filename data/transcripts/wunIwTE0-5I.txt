[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:58.300]   - Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.300]   Let me get a few announcements.
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.300]   First of all, this week is our all church praise and prayer.
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.300]   And so we won't be having our regular Bible study,
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.300]   our home groups.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.300]   But at 7.30, again in this room,
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.300]   we'll have time of corporate prayer.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.300]   So please try to come a little bit earlier.
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.300]   And again, the shuttles will be running for parking,
[00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.300]   but if you want to park nearby,
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.300]   it's probably best if you came a little bit earlier.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.300]   Next round of our membership class
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.300]   is happening on September 29th,
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.300]   which is on a Sunday at 9.30 in the Youth Chapel.
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.300]   There's an eight-week course.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.300]   So if you are applying to become a member,
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.300]   this is a must class that you need to take.
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.300]   It's starting, again, on September 29th.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.300]   Regional Thanksgiving dinner hosts.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.300]   Okay, so as you guys know,
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.300]   every year we have a regional Thanksgiving
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.300]   where we break up into, I forget how many,
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.300]   30 or 40 different groups.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.300]   And so this is not a sign-up to participate in that.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.300]   This is to host.
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.300]   So if you are interested in hosting a home
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.300]   where you'll be assigned anywhere from 20 to 25 people
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.300]   to come and to celebrate Thanksgiving together
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.300]   on that Sunday, there is a sign-up table outside.
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.300]   So if you walk outside, as soon as you'll run into that.
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.300]   And so please sign up.
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.300]   And you do need to be a member to do this.
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.300]   So if you're willing to do that, please go and sign up.
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.300]   We need maybe about 40 homes, okay?
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.300]   And then, lastly, our Reformation Night
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.300]   on October 31st at 4.30.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.300]   This is, again, obviously a replacement for Halloween.
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.300]   And so they need volunteers to help for that, that night,
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.300]   and to set up and, you know, various things that's happening.
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.300]   So if you're willing to help participate,
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.300]   either for decoration or purchasing food
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.300]   or running some of the games, if you can go and volunteer.
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.300]   And I think it's also at the same table.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.300]   So if you're walking out and you want to volunteer for that night,
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.300]   please go and sign up for that, okay?
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.300]   All right, let me pray for our offering.
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.300]   I'll give you a minute to give.
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.300]   If you brought a physical offering, again,
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.300]   we have a box in the back.
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.300]   As you're walking out, you'll see it hanging on the wall.
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.300]   Otherwise, I'll give you a minute to do that
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.300]   and then after our main time of praise,
[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.300]   our brother Bradley is going to come up
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.300]   and give his testimony and be baptized.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:12.300]   All right, let's pray.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:16.300]   Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.300]   Thank you for the gathering of the saints
[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:22.300]   that we may corporately worship you in one voice.
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.300]   And I pray that you would continue to strengthen our community,
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.300]   that we would, day by day, week by week,
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.300]   become more and more like Christ,
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:35.300]   that we would be worshipers who will worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.300]   We pray, Father God, as we've gathered here,
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.300]   help us to fix our eyes upon Christ,
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.300]   that we be strengthened, that we would worship,
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.300]   and even in this giving,
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.300]   that it would be an act of worship and thanksgiving,
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.300]   expression of our love towards you,
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.300]   that it may be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.300]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.300]   (soft piano music)
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:05.300]   (soft piano music)
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:10.300]   (soft piano music)

[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.300]   (soft piano music)
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.300]   Let us all rise and let's spend a few moments
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.300]   to greet the neighbors around us.
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:52.300]   (crowd murmuring)
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:57.300]   (crowd murmuring)
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:22.300]   (soft piano music)
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:27.300]   (soft piano music)
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.300]   When we walk with the Lord.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.300]   When we walk with the Lord
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.300]   In the light of his word
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:42.300]   What a glory he sheds on our way
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:47.300]   While we do his good will
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.300]   He abides with us still
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:56.300]   And with all who will trust and obey
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:01.300]   Trust and obey
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.300]   For there's no other way
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:09.300]   To be happy in Jesus
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:14.300]   But to trust and obey
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:19.300]   (soft piano music)
[00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.300]   (soft piano music)
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.300]   Not a shadow
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.300]   Not a shadow can rise
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.300]   Not a cloud in the skies
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:39.300]   But a smile quickly drives it away
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.300]   Not a doubt or a fear
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:46.300]   Not a sigh or a tear
[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:53.300]   Can abide while we trust and obey
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.300]   Trust and obey
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.300]   For there's no other way
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:05.300]   To be happy in Jesus
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.300]   But to trust and obey
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:14.300]   (soft piano music)
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:21.300]   (soft piano music)
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.300]   God above can prove
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.300]   The delights of his love
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:35.300]   Until all on the altar we lay
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.300]   For the favor he shows
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.300]   And the joy he bestows
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:49.300]   Are for them who will trust and obey
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.300]   Trust and obey
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.300]   For there's no other way
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:17:00.300]   To be happy in Jesus
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:04.300]   But to trust and obey
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:13.300]   (soft piano music)
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.300]   Then in fellowship
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.300]   Then in fellowship sweet
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:23.300]   We will sit at his feet
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.300]   Or we'll walk by his side
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.300]   In the way
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.300]   What he says we will do
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:37.300]   Where he sends we will go
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:44.300]   Never fear only trust and obey
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.300]   Trust and obey
[00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.300]   For there's no other way
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:56.300]   To be happy in Jesus
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:00.300]   But to trust and obey
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.300]   Trust and obey
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.300]   For there's no other way
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:11.300]   To be happy in Jesus
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:16.300]   But to trust and obey
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:35.300]   (soft piano music)
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:46.300]   (soft rock music)
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.300]   - Who has held
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.300]   Who has held
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:55.300]   The oceans in his hands
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.300]   Who has numbered
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:02.300]   Every grain of sand
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.300]   Kings and nations
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.300]   Tremble at his voice
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.300]   All creation
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:16.300]   Rises to rejoice
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:21.300]   Behold our God
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.300]   Seated on his throne
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:29.300]   Come let us adore him
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:34.300]   Behold our King
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.300]   Nothing can compare
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:44.300]   Come let us adore him
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:52.300]   (soft rock music)
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.300]   - Who has given
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:59.300]   Who has given
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.300]   Counsel to the Lord
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.300]   Who can question
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.300]   Any of his words
[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.300]   Who can teach
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:15.300]   The one who knows all things
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.300]   Who can fathom
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:23.300]   All his wondrous deeds
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:28.300]   Behold our God
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.300]   Seated on his throne
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:36.300]   Come let us adore him
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:41.300]   Behold our King
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.300]   Nothing can compare
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:51.300]   Come let us adore him
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:21:00.300]   (soft rock music)
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.300]   - Who has felt
[00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.300]   Who has felt
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.300]   The nails upon his hands
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:15.300]   Bearing all the guilt of sinful man
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.300]   God eternal
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.300]   Humble to the grave
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.300]   Jesus Savior
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:29.300]   Risen now to reign
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:34.300]   Behold our God
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.300]   Seated on his throne
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:42.300]   Come let us adore him
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:47.300]   Behold our King
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.300]   Nothing can compare
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:57.300]   Come let us adore him
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:00.300]   (soft rock music)
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.300]   - You will reign
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.300]   You will reign
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.300]   - Let your glory fill the earth
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.300]   - You will reign
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:15.300]   - Let your glory fill the earth
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.300]   - You will reign
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.300]   - Let your glory fill the earth
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.300]   - You will reign
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:27.300]   - Let your glory fill
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:32.300]   - Behold our God
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.300]   Seated on his throne
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:40.300]   Come let us adore him
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:45.300]   Behold our King
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.300]   Nothing can compare
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:53.300]   Come let us adore him
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:58.300]   Behold our God
[00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:02.300]   Seated on his throne
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:07.300]   Come let us adore him
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:12.300]   Behold our King
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.300]   Nothing can compare
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:24.300]   Come let us adore him
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:35.300]   - Amen, you may be seated.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.300]   - Hi, everyone.
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.300]   I grew up in a God-centered household.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:40.300]   I went to church every Sunday,
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.300]   read the Bible every day,
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.300]   and did Bible studies every weekend.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.300]   However, I had a very false understanding of God
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.300]   and what it truly meant to be a Christian.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.300]   Romans 10:9 says,
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.300]   "If you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.300]   "and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead,
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.300]   "you will be saved."
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.300]   From this, I thought that all I had to do
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.300]   was somewhat believe that Christ died for me,
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.300]   and then I would go to heaven.
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.300]   But everything in that relationship was superficial,
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.300]   and though I'd always heard that Jesus died for my sins,
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.300]   nothing meant anything to me about why he did it
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.300]   and how great his love was to pay that sacrifice.
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.300]   I used to think I was saved simply because I believed
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.300]   there was a God somewhere in the universe
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.300]   that I could call on for help.
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.300]   But deep down, I doubted whether God even existed.
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.300]   On the outside, I looked like a Christian,
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.300]   but inwardly I struggled with my faith.
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.300]   As I became a teen,
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.300]   I started wanting to skip church on Sundays,
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:38.300]   and during the week I lived no differently than a nonbeliever.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.300]   Despite not believing in God,
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:43.300]   I still convinced myself that I was somehow saved.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:47.300]   However, two years ago, my family changed churches.
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.300]   In the first lesson in youth group,
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.300]   I learned about the parable of the sower
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.300]   and the four types of soil.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.300]   I realized that the path of a real Christian is narrow
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.300]   and that I was actually among the many
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.300]   on the wide path toward destruction.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.300]   After that service, I felt very conflicted in my heart,
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.300]   knowing that I was living with a false identity
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.300]   pretending to be a believer,
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.300]   when in reality I was far from it.
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.300]   I didn't want to come back here.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.300]   I wanted to go back to our old church,
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.300]   where I could maintain my passive knowledge of God
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.300]   and take comfort that I was saved.
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.300]   I didn't want to commit
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.300]   because I wanted to keep living my own way.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.300]   But we continued to come here,
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.300]   and slowly my hardened heart softened.
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.300]   Phrases and songs that I'd heard for years
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.300]   started to make more sense,
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.300]   and I finally understood the weight of Jesus' death on my life.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.300]   I felt guilty that I had lived so long for myself,
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.300]   and for the first time I understood my sinfulness.
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:45.300]   I asked myself, "Why would Jesus want to save someone like me,
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.300]   someone who's only lived for himself
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.300]   and indulges in the world?
[00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:52.300]   What did I do to deserve any of this love?"
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.300]   Then I realized that I had misunderstood
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.300]   the gospel my entire life.
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.300]   I'd always thought that faith had to be justified by works.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.300]   But faith was never like that, but by grace,
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.300]   and that Jesus died for me while I was still lost and confused,
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.300]   that I might ultimately be saved.
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.300]   A holy God never stopped loving me despite my sin.
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.300]   I finally understood what his grace meant,
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.300]   and I wanted to know more about him.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.300]   I started praying every day,
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.300]   and in this I found what it truly means to be a Christian--
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.300]   someone who desires to seek God,
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.300]   who understands that they're a terrible person
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.300]   deserving of the worst punishment,
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.300]   but is saved by an unyielding and unconditional love
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.300]   they don't deserve.
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.300]   I wanted to get baptized today
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.300]   to unite myself in Christ's death and resurrection
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.300]   as someone with a real relationship with God,
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.300]   not one that's only on the surface.
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.300]   I now understand Jesus' sacrifice for me
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.300]   and want to fully surrender and glorify God
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.300]   for the rest of my life.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.300]   Thank you.
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.300]   [applause]
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.300]   ...you understand when you go into the water,
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.300]   you're united in Christ's death,
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.300]   come out united in Christ's life.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.300]   At that time, you can praise the Father, the Son.
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:22.300]   [applause]
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.300]   All right, thank you, Bradley,
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.300]   for that clear and powerful testimony.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.300]   If you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.300]   to Luke chapter 9,
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.300]   we'll be reading from verse 12 through 17.
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:46.300]   Luke chapter 9, verses 12 through 17.
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:51.300]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.300]   "Now the day was ending,
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.300]   and the twelve came and said to him,
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.300]   'Send the crowd away,
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.300]   that they may go into the surrounding villages
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.300]   and the countryside and find lodging
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.300]   and get something to eat.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.300]   For here we are in a desolate place.'
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.300]   But he said to them,
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.300]   'You give them something to eat.'
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.300]   And they said, 'We have no more
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.300]   than five loaves and two fish.
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.300]   Unless, perhaps, we go and buy food
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.300]   for all these people,
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.300]   for there are about five thousand men.'
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.300]   And he said to his disciples,
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.300]   'Have them sit down to eat
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.300]   in groups of about fifty each.'
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.300]   They did so, and had them all sit down.
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.300]   Then the two fish, and looking up to heaven,
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.300]   he blessed them and broke them,
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.300]   and kept giving them to the disciples
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.300]   to set before the people.
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.300]   And they all ate and were satisfied,
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.300]   and the broken pieces which they had left over
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.300]   were picked up, twelve baskets full."
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.300]   Let's pray.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:49.300]   Father, we pray for understanding.
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:53.300]   We pray for deeper knowledge of who you are,
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.300]   and that we would hear your voice,
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.300]   that your people may follow.
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.300]   We pray for your Holy Spirit
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.300]   to guide and lead us, convict us,
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.300]   and mold us according to your purpose.
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.300]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:09.300]   Just to review,
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.300]   again, whenever we study the Bible,
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.300]   we need to understand the context
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.300]   in which this text is written in.
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.300]   And so, we've been looking at the Gospel of Luke,
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.300]   and Jesus' primary thing that he's been doing
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.300]   up to this point is to identify his credential.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:28.300]   We were talking about how last week,
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.300]   King Herod was asked a question
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.300]   because of his reputation
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.300]   and the miracles that he was performing
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.300]   and what he was preaching,
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.300]   and he said, "Could this possibly be Elijah?
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:42.300]   Could this possibly be one of the prophets?
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.300]   Could this be John the Baptist
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.300]   who was risen from the dead?"
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.300]   And the question that he asked is,
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.300]   "Who is this man?"
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.300]   And that's exactly why Jesus was doing
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.300]   what he was doing, to identify his credential.
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.300]   He was trying to show
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.300]   his disciples and the crowd
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.300]   his power over the storm.
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.300]   And even they were amazed
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.300]   that after walking with him for so many years,
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.300]   that he had authority
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.300]   to just command the storm to stop,
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.300]   and it stops.
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.300]   We saw that he had
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.300]   authority over demons,
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.300]   a legion of demons,
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.300]   that they couldn't control this man.
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.300]   He was wreaking havoc in that area,
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.300]   and Jesus, all he does is show up
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.300]   and they're terrified.
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.300]   So the disciples saw that, and they said,
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.300]   "Who is this man that even the demons are terrified?"
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.300]   And as he is going on his journey
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.300]   to heal this young girl,
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.300]   and a woman who's been
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.300]   hemorrhaging for 12 years,
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.300]   all she does is reaches out and touches him,
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.300]   and he says, "Power leads him,"
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.300]   and he heals him.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.300]   He has power over nature, he has power over demons,
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:52.300]   he has power over disease,
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.300]   and then finally he has power over death.
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:56.300]   And in case anybody had
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.300]   any question about his identity,
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.300]   Jesus was making it very clear.
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:04.300]   This miracle that he performs here,
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.300]   the feeding of the 5,000, is very unique.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.300]   Not because of the power
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.300]   that he was demonstrating.
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.300]   He's already demonstrated his power
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.300]   over demons and nature,
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.300]   and even over death.
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.300]   But this is the only miracle
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:21.300]   that is mentioned in all four Gospels.
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:24.300]   And it's not by accident.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.300]   You would think that
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.300]   the young girl that he raised from the dead,
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.300]   the demoniac who had
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.300]   legions of demons in him,
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.300]   that that would be worthy enough that
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:35.300]   all the disciples would remember.
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.300]   That's something that needs to be into the Gospels,
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.300]   that we all were able to remember.
[00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.300]   But of all the miracles, this is the miracle.
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.300]   And you can almost say
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.300]   it's out of the many miracles that he performed,
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.300]   it's one of the kind of mundane ones.
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.300]   Just feeding people.
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.300]   But this is the miracle
[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.300]   that is mentioned in all four Gospels.
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:56.300]   And there's a reason for that.
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.300]   And when you understand the context,
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.300]   and hopefully at the end of the sermon,
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.300]   that you can understand
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.300]   why this was recorded for everybody.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.300]   If you look at Jesus' ministry,
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.300]   he's been with his disciples
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.300]   anywhere from a year and a half to two years.
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.300]   And so after this miracle,
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.300]   he's at the pinnacle of his success,
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.300]   where he has thousands of people following him
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.300]   everywhere he goes.
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.300]   And then after he performs his miracle,
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:23.300]   he begins to turn his attention toward Jerusalem.
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.300]   And if you read any commentary,
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.300]   they'll tell you that his focus,
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.300]   he performs other miracles,
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.300]   but his focus now begins to be on his disciples.
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.300]   He spends a lot more time
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:34.300]   privately with his disciples,
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:36.300]   instructing them, telling them,
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:38.300]   and preparing them for the cross.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.300]   And so you'll see
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.300]   that he begins to turn his attention
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.300]   toward his disciples,
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:47.300]   and he begins a slow trek down to Jerusalem.
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:48.300]   So you can kind of say
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.300]   that this was kind of like
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.300]   the end of his public ministry.
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.300]   Not that the public wasn't with him,
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.300]   not that he wasn't performing any kind of miracles,
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.300]   but official public ministry,
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.300]   he kind of closes after this,
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.300]   and then he begins to give his attention
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.300]   to what is private.
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:07.300]   Now, why is this so important?
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:11.300]   Hopefully, we'll sum it up at the end,
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:14.300]   and why he left this mark,
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.300]   and why the Gospels,
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.300]   all four Gospels,
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.300]   remind us of this miracle.
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.300]   In any time we study the Bible,
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.300]   we need to understand the context, right?
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.300]   If you just read it on the surface,
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.300]   you may not understand the nuance
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.300]   of little things that are being said
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:30.300]   and why they did what they did.
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.300]   So what I want to start with
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.300]   is to understand the context,
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.300]   the condition of the people, right?
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.300]   So that you can kind of get a picture
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.300]   of what this crowd is like.
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.300]   And when they said that they were hungry,
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.300]   what it was actually like.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.300]   The excitement toward Jesus
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.300]   has hit its peak.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.300]   In Luke 9, 10-13, 10 and 11 says,
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.300]   "When the apostles returned,
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.300]   "they gave an account to him, Jesus,
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.300]   "of all that they had done.
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.300]   "Taking them with him,
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.300]   "he withdrew by himself to a city
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.300]   "called Bethsaida."
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.300]   Bethsaida is on the other side of Galilee.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.300]   "But the crowds were aware of this
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.300]   "and followed him,
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.300]   "and welcoming them, he began speaking to them
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.300]   "about the kingdom of God
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.300]   "and curing those who had need of healing."
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.300]   Now why did Jesus take his disciples
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.300]   to the other side of the lake?
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.300]   They just came back from a long mission trip.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:20.300]   And they came back and reported.
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.300]   And so he was taking them
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.300]   to the other side of Galilee to rest.
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.300]   To take a break.
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.300]   But as soon as the crowds heard
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.300]   that they were gone,
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.300]   they packed up their bags
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.300]   and they chased them down to the other side.
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.300]   In John chapter six one it says,
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.300]   "After these things, Jesus went away
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:40.300]   "to the other side of the Sea of Galilee,
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.300]   "otherwise known as Tiberias."
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.300]   This is an area where it was mixed
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.300]   with Jews and Gentiles.
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.300]   But the primary area
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.300]   where Jesus was doing his miracles
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.300]   was the other side.
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.300]   That's where the crowds were.
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.300]   But they followed Jesus
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.300]   all the way to the other side.
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.300]   Now you have to remember,
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.300]   this is not a small lake.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:02.300]   This is quite a trek to get to the other side.
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.300]   Mark chapter 6, 33 it says,
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.300]   "The people saw them going
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.300]   "and many recognized them
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.300]   "and ran there together
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.300]   "on foot from all the cities
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:14.300]   "and got there ahead of them."
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.300]   They were looking for Jesus
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.300]   and when they couldn't find him,
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.300]   he says, they ran expecting.
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.300]   Said, "Oh, you know what?
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.300]   "We saw Jesus and his disciples
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.300]   "get on a boat
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.300]   "and they're headed toward the other side."
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.300]   As soon as they hear,
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:24.300]   they pack up their bags
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:25.300]   and their children
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.300]   and whatever they had,
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.300]   they go over there.
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.300]   And as soon as Jesus lands,
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.300]   it says, "The mob."
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.300]   Again, so this is not
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.300]   an organized crowd.
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.300]   This is not a group of people
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.300]   who came to a conference
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.300]   opening and guards coming in
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.300]   with name tags.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.300]   This is 5,000 men.
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.300]   At least that's what's recorded here.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.300]   5,000 men who are running
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.300]   toward Jesus.
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.300]   Now we know that number 5,000
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.300]   is just the count of men.
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.300]   That we know that there are
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.300]   women and children there.
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.300]   You know how we know that?
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.300]   Where did he get the fish and the loaves?
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.300]   A child.
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:05.300]   A child brought it.
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.300]   So we know that there are children there
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.300]   and we know wherever there's children,
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.300]   it's not just the fathers.
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.300]   The mothers are nearby.
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.300]   So a conservative count
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.300]   of the total number of people
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.300]   is somewhere around 20,000.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.300]   I've read that some think
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.300]   it was as large as 30,000 people.
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.300]   I don't know if you've ever seen
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:30.300]   a crowd of people, like a mob.
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.300]   I don't think you've ever seen,
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.300]   maybe even on television,
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:38.300]   a mob of 20,000 people running.
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.300]   That's a scary scene.
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.300]   And that's what the Bible describes,
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:45.300]   that they were so excited about Jesus,
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:49.300]   they just would not leave him alone.
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.300]   I remember years ago,
[00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.300]   we were coming in and out of China,
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.300]   and we came out of this market,
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.300]   and there was a few homeless people
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.300]   there asking for money.
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:03.300]   And 10 kuai would be equivalent
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.300]   to about $1.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:06.300]   And 10 kuai, for them,
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.300]   was a decent amount of money.
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.300]   They can get a meal with that.
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.300]   So I reached into my pocket,
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.300]   and what I thought was 10 kuai
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.300]   came out at 100 kuai.
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.300]   The red bill came out.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:20.300]   And as soon as they saw the red bill,
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.300]   and I quickly tried to put it
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.300]   back into my pocket,
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.300]   and I remember seeing somebody
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.300]   grabbing my right hand.
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.300]   And I forced my 100 kuai
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.300]   back into my pocket,
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.300]   and I saw a man.
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.300]   I felt a man just pulling my hand
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.300]   out of my pocket.
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.300]   And then I was struggling to get it in,
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.300]   and then next thing I know,
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.300]   I feel somebody else on the other side
[00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:41.300]   reaching into my pocket,
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.300]   and I'm grabbing that person.
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.300]   And next thing I know,
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.300]   here's this grandma with this small child
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.300]   in the back searching through my pockets,
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.300]   and I knew I was in trouble.
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.300]   And all of a sudden,
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.300]   I started getting attention
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.300]   of all the people there.
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.300]   Next thing I knew,
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:56.300]   I had four or five different people
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:57.300]   grabbing at my limbs,
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:58.300]   trying to get into my pocket
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.300]   to reach for that money.
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.300]   So I knew I was in trouble,
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.300]   so I had enough strength
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.300]   to kind of push them aside
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.300]   because that was a grandma
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.300]   that was doing that.
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.300]   So I pushed them aside,
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.300]   and I remember passing Alex,
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.300]   who's in Taiwan right now,
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.300]   who was nearby,
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.300]   and I pushed them aside,
[00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.300]   and I started to run,
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.300]   and I told Alex,
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.300]   "Hey, Alex, go and catch a taxi."
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.300]   So some of you guys,
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.300]   there's a few people in this room
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.300]   that remember that trip,
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:26.300]   and I told Alex,
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.300]   "Hey, go to the other side
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.300]   "'cause I'm going to run this way,
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.300]   "and hopefully I could ditch them,
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.300]   "and then I'll come and jump into the taxi,
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.300]   "and we'll get away from this."
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.300]   And as I pushed them,
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.300]   and as I started running,
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:36.300]   I turned around,
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:38.300]   they started running after me.
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.300]   I said, "I thought that guy had a crutch.
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.300]   "He's healed!"
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.300]   (laughter)
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:46.300]   And so I had to run across the street,
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.300]   and then I could make a sharp left turn,
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.300]   and they were chasing me the whole time,
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.300]   and by the time I got to the taxi,
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.300]   you know, Alex had a taxi ready,
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:54.300]   and I jumped into the car,
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.300]   shut the door,
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.300]   and even as we were taking off,
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.300]   they were banging on the door
[00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.300]   because they wanted that 100 kuai.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.300]   Now, that was about four or five homeless people,
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.300]   and I remember thinking,
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.300]   "Man, we got out of that."
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.300]   And to this day, I tell that story, right?
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:12.300]   The Bible says that there were 500 men
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.300]   with their wives and children
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.300]   would not leave them alone.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:24.300]   Years ago, we used to have church picnics,
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.300]   church sports day.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.300]   Some of you guys who've been here for a while
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:27.300]   remember that,
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:30.300]   and we had it until we were about 400 people,
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:34.300]   so we used to go park nearby in Irvine,
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.300]   and we used to have games.
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:37.300]   We used to have volleyball,
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.300]   and obviously, we stopped doing that,
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.300]   and part of the reason why we stopped doing that,
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.300]   it was just utter chaos.
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:45.300]   I remember having games
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:48.300]   and having maybe about 10 teams lined up,
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.300]   and we're trying to give instructions
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:53.300]   of you're going to go down and turn around
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.300]   and come back and just simple instructions,
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.300]   and I remember once we got lined up,
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:00.300]   different people were going at different times,
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.300]   and we had those megaphones,
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.300]   and we're trying to say,
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.300]   "No, we didn't start yet,"
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:07.300]   but already half of them are gone,
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.300]   and just utter chaos for about an hour and a half
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.300]   because they couldn't hear our voice,
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:13.300]   so we couldn't get anything done.
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:15.300]   So after that, we say, "Okay, that's enough.
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.300]   "We can't do this anymore."
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:19.300]   That's with 400 people.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.300]   This is 20,000 people
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.300]   who are packed up with small children
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:29.300]   coming after Christ.
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.300]   They come after Christ,
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.300]   and they're so enamored with Him,
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.300]   they weren't even thinking.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:36.300]   They followed Him out into the desolate place
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.300]   without food.
[00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:40.300]   I don't know about you,
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.300]   but any time we have an event at church,
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.300]   the first thing that we have to ask ourselves
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.300]   is how we're going to feed these people.
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:50.300]   Yesterday, we had the BAM retreat here,
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:55.300]   and we had about 240 singles who met over the weekend,
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:57.300]   and one of the biggest things that needs to happen
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:01.300]   is we have to figure out the food.
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.300]   What are they going to eat?
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.300]   How are they going to eat?
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:05.300]   How much money is it going to take?
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:09.300]   Again, that's with 200 people.
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.300]   The biggest problem when we go to a retreat
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.300]   with maybe about 1,000 people is the food.
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:14.300]   Where are they going to eat?
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.300]   Every time we have a retreat,
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.300]   where are these 1,000 people going to get in the cars
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.300]   and go and find food,
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.300]   and we have to distribute and all this?
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:25.300]   Imagine 20,000 people are running to Christ
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.300]   without thinking about food with young children,
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:32.300]   and they come, and Jesus is ministering to them,
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:34.300]   and then it becomes nighttime,
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:38.300]   and they realize, "Hey, we don't have food.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.300]   What are we going to do?"
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.300]   Now, that's the context.
[00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.300]   So this is not an organized mob, an organized group.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.300]   This is not a retreat with 20,000 people.
[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.300]   This is not a conference where you have people organized,
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.300]   coming, sitting down.
[00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.300]   We have a schedule.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.300]   This is a mob that came after Christ,
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.300]   that Jesus was ministering to.
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.300]   So I want you to understand the context
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.300]   in which this takes place.
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.300]   So that's the crowd.
[00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:09.300]   I want you to understand the condition of the disciples.
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:13.300]   They must have been tired.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.300]   The whole reason why they're on the other side
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:15.300]   is to take a break.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.300]   They just came back from a long mission trip,
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:21.300]   and Jesus was taking them aside to get some rest.
[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:24.300]   And this mob comes,
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.300]   and instead of sending them away,
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:27.300]   Jesus begins to minister to them.
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:30.300]   So can you imagine how tired they must have been?
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:32.300]   And I've shared this before out in India
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.300]   when we do the medical camp.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.300]   We have several teams.
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.300]   We have the eye care team,
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.300]   we have the medical team,
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.300]   we have the VBS team,
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:43.300]   and then we have the security team.
[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:45.300]   We have the security because almost always
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:46.300]   at the end of the day,
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:49.300]   we have a larger crowd than when we started.
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.300]   And so we need to have security in there
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:53.300]   because they're always pushing to try to get through the door
[00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:54.300]   because they want to see the doctors
[00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:58.300]   and get glasses or get some sort of treatment.
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.300]   And so at the end of the day,
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.300]   the people who are at the door basically
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:07.300]   was wrestling with the crowd for four, five, six hours.
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.300]   That's with maybe 100, 150, 200 people.
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:16.300]   This is 20,000 people with 12 disciples,
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:18.300]   and they just wouldn't leave them alone,
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:23.300]   even on the other side of the sea.
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.300]   Now, again, I say all of this to you
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.300]   because I want you to understand the state of mind
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:30.300]   that the disciples must have been in
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.300]   when the sun's going down,
[00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.300]   and they see all these people and children running around,
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.300]   and there's nothing to eat.
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.300]   In Luke chapter 9, 12, it says,
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:43.300]   "Now the day was ending, and the 12 came and said to him,
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.300]   'Send the crowd away.'"
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.300]   I want you to stop and think about that.
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.300]   Now, we can read that superficially and say,
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:54.300]   "Well, they were so concerned about the people.
[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.300]   Hey, they don't have food.
[00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.300]   What are we going to do about them?"
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.300]   It could be, and I'm not saying it is not,
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:01.300]   but when I understand the context,
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.300]   when I read this,
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:06.300]   I could tell there's a tinge of irritation
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:09.300]   because they're tired.
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.300]   It's not our fault.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.300]   You're the one who came after us.
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:14.300]   You wouldn't let us rest,
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.300]   and you don't have food.
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:17.300]   Jesus, send them away
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.300]   that they may go into the surrounding villages
[00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:19.300]   and courtside."
[00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:23.300]   I think knowing all that we know,
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:25.300]   this is an educated guess,
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:26.300]   but by this time,
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.300]   they're pretty irritated with the crowd, right?
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.300]   And that's why when Jesus,
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.300]   that woman who was hemorrhaging,
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.300]   touched Jesus,
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.300]   "Who touched me?"
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:36.300]   He's like, "Jesus, everybody's touching you."
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:39.300]   "What do you mean, who touched you?"
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.300]   I can imagine these guys are just tired,
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.300]   and they're not leaving them alone.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:47.300]   He said, "Jesus, send them away."
[00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:48.300]   Right?
[00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:49.300]   "Send them away.
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:51.300]   Let them find a village,
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.300]   and maybe after they go,
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.300]   we can get some rest,
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:55.300]   or maybe we can sneak away
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.300]   and go to the other side."
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.300]   I don't know about you,
[00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:00.300]   but I sense that there's some irritation
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:04.300]   on their part, right?
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.300]   But what's interesting here
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:11.300]   is that Jesus had something in mind.
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.300]   This was not just a random event.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.300]   In Luke 9:13, he said,
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:16.300]   "But he said to them,
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.300]   'You give them something to eat.'"
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.300]   Right?
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.300]   He said, "Then he was like,
[00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.300]   'Send them away.
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.300]   Take them to the village.
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:23.300]   Get away.'"
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:24.300]   He said, "No, you give them something to eat."
[00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:25.300]   And they said,
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.300]   "We have no more than five loaves and two fish,
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.300]   unless perhaps we go and buy food
[00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:33.300]   for all these people."
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:36.300]   That's called sarcasm.
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.300]   Right?
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.300]   Even if they had the money,
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.300]   how's 12 people going to go get food
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.300]   for 20,000 people?
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:43.300]   So he's like,
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.300]   "You want us to go get it?"
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.300]   Right?
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.300]   Again, I sense some irritation.
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:51.300]   Right?
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.300]   "You want us to go get food?"
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.300]   John 6, 5-7, it says,
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:57.300]   "Therefore Jesus, lifting up his eyes,
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.300]   seeing that a large crowd was coming to him,
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.300]   said to Philip,
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:02.300]   'Where are we to buy bread
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.300]   so that these may eat?'
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:08.300]   This he was saying to test him."
[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.300]   He had plans already
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.300]   to draw out his disciples
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.300]   because he wanted to show them something.
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:15.300]   "For he himself knew
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:16.300]   that he was intending to do,"
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:17.300]   Philip answered,
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.300]   "Two hundred denarii worth of bread
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:20.300]   is not sufficient for them
[00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:23.300]   for everyone to receive a little."
[00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.300]   Two hundred denarii would be equivalent
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:28.300]   to something around $20,000.
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:31.300]   That would be $1 per person.
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:32.300]   Right?
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:36.300]   So imagine if by today's meal,
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.300]   it would cost at least $10 to $15
[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:40.300]   just to get a panini.
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:41.300]   Right?
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:43.300]   And you might get a drink, maybe.
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.300]   Right?
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:48.300]   $1, maybe get us some bread
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:51.300]   and some onion.
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.300]   Maybe if we have a little bit left over,
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.300]   we can throw some cheese in there.
[00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:56.300]   And they're saying,
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.300]   "Well, even $20,000.
[00:46:58.300 --> 00:46:59.300]   They would just get a taste.
[00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:00.300]   That's not enough."
[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:01.300]   In other words,
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:04.300]   "Jesus, what are you talking about?
[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.300]   All these people need to eat
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.300]   and you're telling us that we would...
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:09.300]   How are we going to do that?"
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.300]   In Mark 6:37,
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.300]   "And he answered them,
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.300]   'You give them some tea.'
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.300]   And they said to him,
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.300]   'Shall we go and spend 200 denarii on bread
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.300]   and give them something to eat?'"
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:21.300]   Again, sarcasm.
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:22.300]   What's interesting here
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:24.300]   is that up to this point,
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.300]   they saw Jesus' power.
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.300]   This would be the minor miracle
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:30.300]   compared to the other stuff
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:32.300]   that they've seen.
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:33.300]   He calmed the storm.
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.300]   He tells the storm,
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.300]   he said, "Enough!"
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:37.300]   And the storm abates.
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.300]   A legion of demons.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.300]   They shudder in fear.
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:45.300]   And he commands this legion of demons
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.300]   to get out.
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.300]   And they get out.
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:49.300]   Diseased woman,
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:50.300]   just by touching him,
[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:51.300]   being near him,
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:52.300]   is healed.
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.300]   This hemorrhaging woman.
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:56.300]   A dead child is raised
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:57.300]   simply by his word.
[00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:58.300]   They saw this.
[00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.300]   They had front row seats to all of this.
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:01.300]   But when Jesus said,
[00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.300]   "You feed them."
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:03.300]   He's like, "What?
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:04.300]   What are you talking about?
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:05.300]   How are we going to do this?
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:06.300]   We don't have enough money.
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.300]   You want us to go get the food?
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:16.300]   Why was it so hard for them to believe?
[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.300]   Are we any different?
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:20.300]   You know, we get together
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:22.300]   and we talk about how awesome God is
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.300]   and how he created the universe
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:25.300]   and where everything's made by him
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:28.300]   and for him.
[00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.300]   But the thing that we wrestle with
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:31.300]   is not the creation of the universe
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.300]   or that Jesus died for our sins
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:35.300]   and we're going to go to heaven
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:36.300]   and eternity
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:37.300]   and a new heaven and new earth
[00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:38.300]   is going to be created.
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:39.300]   It's like we believe all that.
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:40.300]   We sing about all that.
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.300]   We praise God for that.
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:43.300]   But we wrestle with like,
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:47.300]   "Is he really going to pay our bills?
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:50.300]   Is he really going to take care of our needs?"
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:54.300]   It's the mundane, pedestrian things,
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.300]   common things that we wrestle with.
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:58.300]   There's a reason why Jesus says
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:48:59.300]   in Romans 8.32,
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:02.300]   "He who did not spare his own son,
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.300]   but gave him up for us all,
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:05.300]   gave his only begotten Son up for us,
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:07.300]   how will he not along with him
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:10.300]   give us all these things?"
[00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:13.300]   If he gave his only begotten precious Son,
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.300]   why do you have such a hard time believing
[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:17.300]   that all the other things
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:20.300]   that God would not withhold?
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:24.300]   And yet, isn't that who we are?
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:25.300]   It's the mundane things.
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:27.300]   We become blinded to the things
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:29.300]   that are around us so easy
[00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.300]   that we're able to take care of
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:32.300]   and those are the areas
[00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:34.300]   that we kind of have a difficult time
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:36.300]   believing in God.
[00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:37.300]   We only believe in God
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.300]   that's far away
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.300]   and does mighty, great things
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:42.300]   that we can't even possibly imagine.
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:43.300]   But anything that you and I think
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:44.300]   that we are capable of doing,
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:45.300]   we have a hard time believing
[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:48.300]   that he's going to step in.
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:49.300]   That's our tendency.
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:51.300]   We are oftentimes blinded
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.300]   to the most mundane things.
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:55.300]   And the most powerful miracles in life
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:59.300]   are usually pretty mundane.
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:02.300]   The fact that you and I breathe
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.300]   is mundane.
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.300]   That's a miracle of God.
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:09.300]   The fact that we're not destroyed?
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:10.300]   Mundane.
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.300]   Miracle of God.
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.300]   Think how often we celebrate people
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.300]   who remember our birthdays
[00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:18.300]   and, "Whoa, they're such a good friend.
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.300]   "They're such a good friend.
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.300]   "They do so much for us.
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:22.300]   "They remember.
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.300]   "They're so kind."
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:26.300]   And then the mom who wakes up
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:27.300]   every single morning
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.300]   to cook you breakfast.
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:31.300]   "I don't want eggs today."
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:34.300]   Again?
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:37.300]   The people who do the most for us,
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:41.300]   we have a tendency to be blind toward.
[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:42.300]   So as much as we look at this,
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:45.300]   how can they not have believed this?
[00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.300]   We all struggle with it.
[00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:49.300]   The things that are nearby,
[00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:50.300]   things that are close,
[00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:51.300]   things that you and I think
[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:53.300]   that we are capable of doing,
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.300]   we have a hard time believing.
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:58.300]   The disciples had a difficult time.
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:03.300]   How are we possibly going to feed them?
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:06.300]   So it's in that context, right,
[00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:07.300]   that we need to understand
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:10.300]   Jesus' response.
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:13.300]   If the disciples were tired,
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:14.300]   imagine the one
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:17.300]   that they were chasing after.
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:18.300]   They were trying to get through
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:20.300]   the disciples just to touch him,
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.300]   just to be near him.
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:24.300]   He goes to the other side
[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:25.300]   in Matthew 14, 13 to 14.
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.300]   "Now when Jesus heard about John,
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:29.300]   he withdrew from there in a boat
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:32.300]   to a secluded place by himself.
[00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:33.300]   And when the people heard of this,
[00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:34.300]   they followed him on foot
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.300]   from the cities.
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.300]   And when he went ashore,
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.300]   he saw a large crowd
[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:40.300]   and felt compassion for them
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:44.300]   and healed their sick."
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:48.300]   Now imagine if Jesus was so dead tired
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:50.300]   that in the middle of the storm,
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:53.300]   he was sleeping.
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:54.300]   And the disciples are like,
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:56.300]   "Do you not care?"
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:57.300]   Imagine, just humanly speaking,
[00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:59.300]   how tired he must have been
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:00.300]   that he wasn't waking up,
[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:02.300]   that the professional fishermen
[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:03.300]   were afraid for their life.
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.300]   Can you imagine the water
[00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:06.300]   coming into this boat?
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:07.300]   And Jesus was so knocked out.
[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:09.300]   That's how tired he was.
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:10.300]   So he goes to the other side
[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.300]   to take a break,
[00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.300]   and they come running toward him.
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.300]   How would you have reacted
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:18.300]   if that happened?
[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:19.300]   I don't know about you,
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:20.300]   but I think most of us,
[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:21.300]   no matter how benevolent
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.300]   and patient and kind you are,
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:25.300]   it's like, "Really?"
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.300]   After all that,
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:29.300]   you're not going to give me a minute?
[00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:30.300]   You're not going to give me a minute?
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.300]   I could imagine the disciples
[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:33.300]   were probably thinking the same thing.
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:35.300]   "Really?"
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:38.300]   There's a reason why we got on the boat.
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:39.300]   To get away from you.
[00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:41.300]   Just one night.
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:42.300]   One night.
[00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:44.300]   Give us a break.
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:46.300]   And they see thousands of them
[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:47.300]   running toward him,
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:50.300]   and Jesus' response when he went ashore,
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:51.300]   he saw a large crowd,
[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:54.300]   had compassion
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:55.300]   instead of being irritated,
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:53:00.300]   it says he began to heal them again.
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:02.300]   He kept on doing his ministry.
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:03.300]   In Mark 6, verse 34,
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:04.300]   when Jesus went ashore,
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:05.300]   he saw a large crowd
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:08.300]   and felt compassion for them
[00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:09.300]   because they were like sheep
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:10.300]   without a shepherd,
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:13.300]   and he began to teach them many things.
[00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.300]   He was on his break.
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:16.300]   I mean, if anybody deserved
[00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:19.300]   a little break, it was Jesus.
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:20.300]   And when they came to him,
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:21.300]   instead of being irritated,
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:23.300]   he says he began to heal them.
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.300]   He began to teach them.
[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:28.300]   And they were like sheep without a shepherd.
[00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:29.300]   So we can understand why Jesus
[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:32.300]   was so dead tired in that boat.
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:34.300]   They just would not leave him alone,
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:35.300]   but he saw them,
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:38.300]   and he had compassion.
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:39.300]   A sheep without a shepherd
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:42.300]   is completely helpless.
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:43.300]   A sheep without a shepherd
[00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:46.300]   is hopeless.
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:47.300]   It's vulnerable.
[00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.300]   The wolves can come
[00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:51.300]   and attack them at any time.
[00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:53.300]   They don't know how to eat.
[00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:56.300]   They don't know how to live.
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:59.300]   So in the midst of his fatigue,
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:01.300]   his disciples being irritated,
[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:04.300]   trying to go and get a break,
[00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:05.300]   he sees them coming
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:10.300]   and says he had compassion.
[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:14.300]   Did Jesus need to feed them?
[00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:15.300]   It wasn't like a conference
[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:16.300]   where they advertise
[00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:18.300]   and he drew a crowd to himself.
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:19.300]   He was trying to get away
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:20.300]   from the crowd.
[00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:21.300]   He was a mob who ran toward him.
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.300]   It's your fault.
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:25.300]   You came to him.
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:28.300]   Can you imagine
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:29.300]   anything that you do
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:32.300]   where you don't calculate the food?
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:33.300]   Everywhere you travel,
[00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:34.300]   you have to figure out
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.300]   like how are we going to eat?
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.300]   Do they have breakfast there?
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:37.300]   How are we going to eat lunch?
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:38.300]   How are we going to eat dinner?
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:41.300]   Especially if you have small children.
[00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:42.300]   If you don't figure out
[00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:43.300]   how your children are going to eat,
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.300]   you can't go.
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:46.300]   I don't care.
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:47.300]   Maybe you love Hawaii,
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:48.300]   but there's no food there.
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:50.300]   You can't go.
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:52.300]   These guys were so enamored with Christ.
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.300]   They didn't think about bringing food.
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:55.300]   They just ran.
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:56.300]   Where is he?
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:57.300]   Picked up their bags, their kids,
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:59.300]   and from all over,
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:00.300]   they ran to him
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:02.300]   and then it was getting late at night
[00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:03.300]   and they realized,
[00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.300]   shoot, we forgot to bring food.
[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:07.300]   What are we going to do?
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.300]   Instead of being irritated,
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:12.300]   Jesus begins to heal them
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:15.300]   and begins to teach them
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:19.300]   and feeds them.
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:22.300]   This is who our God is.
[00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:24.300]   Not just here.
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:26.300]   If you read the Old Testament carefully,
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:28.300]   a lot of people read the Old Testament
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:29.300]   superficially and say,
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:31.300]   oh, he destroyed the Canaanites
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:33.300]   and he brought the judgment,
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:36.300]   the flood.
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:39.300]   Doesn't judgment make sense?
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:41.300]   If somebody robbed your house,
[00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:44.300]   don't you want justice?
[00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:45.300]   If you sent a kid to school
[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.300]   and a bully beat up your kid,
[00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:51.300]   don't you want justice?
[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:54.300]   If somebody came and robbed your car,
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:57.300]   you're not hoping grace for them.
[00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:59.300]   Where are the police?
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:00.300]   How come we're allowing
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:03.300]   all this crime to take place?
[00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:06.300]   So doesn't justice make sense?
[00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:09.300]   If you anger this holy God
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.300]   and he's going to crush you,
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:12.300]   who are you?
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:14.300]   Who am I?
[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.300]   Just start over, crush it, start over.
[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:18.300]   His justice makes sense.
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.300]   His anger makes sense.
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:25.300]   What doesn't make sense is his compassion.
[00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:27.300]   In fact, in the Old Testament law,
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:31.300]   when he told the Israelites,
[00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:32.300]   when you harvest,
[00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:35.300]   leave the corner of your harvest alone.
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:36.300]   For what purpose?
[00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:39.300]   Because when the foreigners come into town,
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:40.300]   this is during a period
[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:42.300]   when they don't have restaurants,
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:43.300]   they don't have places to go.
[00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:45.300]   If a foreigner comes into town
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:46.300]   and they don't have anything to eat,
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:47.300]   leave a portion of that
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:50.300]   so that they can eat.
[00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.300]   Who cares?
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:54.300]   Why are they traveling without food?
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:56.300]   These foreigners, these pagans,
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:57.300]   these idol worshipers,
[00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:59.300]   they're coming into Israel.
[00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:00.300]   Who cares about these foreigners?
[00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:02.300]   Let them starve.
[00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:05.300]   But he put it into their law.
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:08.300]   Leave that corner for them
[00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:10.300]   so that these foreigners are coming in
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:12.300]   so that they can eat.
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:15.300]   Why does he care?
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.300]   In fact, it says,
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.300]   he took the five loaves,
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:21.300]   in Luke 9, 16, 17,
[00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:22.300]   and the two fish,
[00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:23.300]   and looking up to heaven,
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:24.300]   he blessed them and broke them
[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:25.300]   and kept giving them to the disciples
[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:26.300]   and set them before the people,
[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:29.300]   and they all ate and were satisfied.
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:32.300]   Satisfied meaning that they were full.
[00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:34.300]   And the broken pieces,
[00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:35.300]   which they had left over,
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:38.300]   picked up 12 basketfuls.
[00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:41.300]   There's two things I want to mention here.
[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:43.300]   One, why does he even use
[00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:46.300]   the five loaves and two fish?
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:47.300]   Right?
[00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:48.300]   I mean, five loaves and two fish,
[00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:49.300]   it's interesting because
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:51.300]   when we think of five loaves,
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:53.300]   it's usually like loaves, right?
[00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:54.300]   And even that's not enough,
[00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:55.300]   but when you actually understand
[00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:57.300]   what the loaf means at that time,
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:59.300]   it's biscuits.
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:00.300]   So basically it was,
[00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:04.300]   his mom packed him just enough food for him
[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:06.300]   for a child, right?
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:08.300]   Why does he even need that
[00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:11.300]   to feed 20,000 people?
[00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:14.300]   And yet he does.
[00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:15.300]   And that's how he works.
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:16.300]   That's a pattern in which--
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:18.300]   why does he need the 12 disciples
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:21.300]   to go proclaim the gospel?
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:23.300]   These guys who betrayed him
[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:24.300]   right before he goes to the cross,
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:26.300]   you're going to use these guys?
[00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:29.300]   He's going to use us?
[00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:30.300]   Just think about just this week
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:32.300]   how distracted you were.
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:34.300]   Just think about this week
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:36.300]   how anxious you were.
[00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:38.300]   The people that hurt you,
[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:40.300]   that you kept regurgitating.
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:45.300]   And he's going to save the world through us?
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:46.300]   Can you imagine this kid
[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:48.300]   who gave Jesus the five loaves
[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:51.300]   and three fish?
[00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:53.300]   He probably went home and said,
[00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:56.300]   "You know that food you ate?
[00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:58.300]   "That was mine."
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:58:59.300]   I said, "What are you talking about?
[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:00.300]   "We fed 20,000 people."
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:01.300]   "I know.
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:04.300]   "I'm the one who gave it to him."
[00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:06.300]   And he probably became a celebrity.
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:08.300]   I bet you for the rest of his life,
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:10.300]   he said, "Oh, that's the five loaves,
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:12.300]   "three fish kid.
[00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:13.300]   "That's the kid."
[00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:14.300]   Probably until the day he died.
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:16.300]   I bet you on his gravestone
[00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:18.300]   he says, "Five loaves, three fish."
[00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:19.300]   That's probably what he had.
[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:20.300]   That's what probably he was known for
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:23.300]   for the rest of his life.
[00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:25.300]   But the reason why he was probably highlighted
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:28.300]   is simply because God used him.
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:30.300]   Can you imagine him walking around?
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:33.300]   He's like, "Yeah, I did it.
[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:35.300]   "Without my five loaves and three fish,
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:36.300]   "Jesus would have never been able
[00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:39.300]   "to feed these 20,000 people."
[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:40.300]   Can you imagine that?
[00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:41.300]   Can you imagine how ridiculous
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:45.300]   that must have sounded?
[00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:47.300]   And yet that's what we struggle with
[00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:49.300]   when God uses us.
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.300]   It's like, boom.
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:54.300]   It's because God recognized my talent.
[00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:56.300]   God recognized what I have.
[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:59.300]   I actually had a pastor friend many years ago
[00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:02.300]   who told me that he thinks that the reason
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.300]   why Japan is so hardened toward the gospel
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:07.300]   is because the right people haven't gone.
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:08.300]   And obviously he was a young man
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.300]   when he said this.
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:14.300]   And he said, "I think God can use me in Japan."
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.300]   Because he was a great preacher,
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:18.300]   bearing a lot of fruit.
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:19.300]   And he said, "If God sends me to Japan,
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:24.300]   "I think I can bear fruit there."
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:25.300]   Can you imagine how ridiculous
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:29.300]   that must have sounded?
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:33.300]   Well, that pastor no longer walks with the Lord.
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.300]   He fell into some sin.
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:37.300]   He was disqualified.
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:41.300]   And as foolish as that sounds,
[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:45.300]   the only reason why he allows us
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:50.300]   to participate is his grace.
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:53.300]   It's not because he needs us.
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.300]   Don't you think evangelism would be better
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.300]   if we moved out of the way
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:00.300]   and God just said, "Believe."
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:01.300]   And he just got his Bible
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:02.300]   and just gave it to you.
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:05.300]   It's like, oh my gosh.
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.300]   Don't you think it would be much more effective
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.300]   than a bunch of people who are wrestling,
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:11.300]   struggling, and doubting, and infighting,
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:13.300]   and questioning each other,
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.300]   and that we're the avenue
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.300]   in which God's going to use
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.300]   to bring the gospel to the world?
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:21.300]   And yet he does.
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:25.300]   But that's why his primary instruction to us
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:29.300]   is to abide.
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:31.300]   And as soon as they got proud,
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:33.300]   remember what Paul said?
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:34.300]   Not many of you are wise.
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:37.300]   Not many of you were smart.
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:39.300]   Not many of you were noble.
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.300]   God chose the base thing.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:42.300]   He chose you because you are base,
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.300]   because you are nothing,
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:47.300]   to dumbfound the wise.
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:49.300]   Right?
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:54.300]   Because that's why his primary instruction
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:56.300]   is to abide.
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:59.300]   And some of you might not like this,
[01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:01.300]   but the reason why he tells us to abide
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.300]   is because he doesn't trust us.
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:04.300]   Right?
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:06.300]   I mean, that goes against everything that I hear.
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:08.300]   God believes in you.
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:10.300]   He doesn't believe in you.
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:11.300]   He doesn't believe in you.
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:15.300]   I don't believe in you.
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:18.300]   I don't believe in myself.
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:21.300]   He didn't give these 12 people
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:23.300]   who are utter failures and say,
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:24.300]   "You know what?
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:25.300]   "I'm going to give you another chance
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:28.300]   "because now I believe in you."
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:29.300]   Right?
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:32.300]   And imagine if that was the case.
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:33.300]   Peter was already compromised.
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:34.300]   Paul had to rebuke him
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:36.300]   and had to record that in Galatians
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.300]   for eternity.
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:39.300]   Believe in it.
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.300]   You're going to believe this guy?
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:42.300]   No.
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.300]   It was his grace
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:48.300]   that allowed this boy to participate.
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:50.300]   And his claim to fame
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:54.300]   was simply that God used what he had.
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:57.300]   That's all he's telling us to do.
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:00.300]   Just all he's telling us to do.
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:02.300]   Trust me.
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:03.300]   Trust me.
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.300]   Abide in me.
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:05.300]   I will do the work.
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:08.300]   I will multiply what you have.
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.300]   I will do it.
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:12.300]   But you know what's also interesting
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:15.300]   is that after he does that,
[01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:19.300]   he says there were 12 baskets left over.
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:22.300]   If we had an event and we made food
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:24.300]   and we had 12 baskets left over,
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.300]   we would probably have an immediate meeting
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:27.300]   and say,
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:29.300]   "Hey, we didn't calculate this correctly.
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:32.300]   "That was a waste."
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.300]   Was Jesus not counting?
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.300]   Is that why?
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.300]   Was that a mistake?
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:37.300]   He over-calculated?
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:40.300]   Did he multiply too much?
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:41.300]   And that's why he had 12 baskets?
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:43.300]   Well, guess what?
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:48.300]   Guess who had to carry those 12 baskets?
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.300]   Right?
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:51.300]   Who would be the candidate
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:52.300]   that would be the best fit
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:54.300]   to carry these 12 baskets?
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:56.300]   I'm guessing
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.300]   that every one of those disciples
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.300]   had to strap that on,
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:01.300]   and when Jesus said, "Let's go,"
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.300]   it's like, "Oh, I'm already tired.
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:06.300]   "Now I've got to carry this?"
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.300]   Now, why do you think he did that?
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:09.300]   He had already told us
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:10.300]   that Jesus was deliberately doing this
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:13.300]   to draw them out.
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:14.300]   I bet you every time
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:15.300]   they had that strapped on,
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.300]   it's like,
[01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:20.300]   "Don't ever question me again."
[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:21.300]   He said, "How are you?"
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.300]   And then they look at the basket
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:24.300]   and they're like, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:27.300]   "That's right."
[01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:28.300]   What was he trying to teach them?
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.300]   Not only about who he is,
[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:33.300]   his credential to his disciples,
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:36.300]   but why the leftover?
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.300]   Because the purpose of this miracle
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:42.300]   ultimately was to reveal himself.
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:43.300]   To reveal himself.
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:47.300]   Remember the first miracle?
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.300]   He turns water into wine.
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:51.300]   Remember what the guests say?
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:53.300]   They said, "You know,
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.300]   "typically in a wedding,
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:55.300]   "they will bring the good wine first,
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:57.300]   "and then after they drink it,
[01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:58.300]   "and then they had enough,
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:04:59.300]   "you get the bad wine,
[01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:01.300]   "so they can't tell the difference.
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:02.300]   "But why at your wedding
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:05.300]   "do you have the best wine at the end?"
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:06.300]   In other words,
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:08.300]   when he turned water into wine,
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.300]   it was better than anything that they had.
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:11.300]   And that's the pattern
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:12.300]   that we see over and over
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.300]   in Ephesians 3, 20 and 21.
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:15.300]   "Now to him who is able
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.300]   "to do far more abundantly
[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:19.300]   "beyond all that we ask or think,
[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:20.300]   "according to the power
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.300]   "that works within us,
[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:23.300]   "to him be the glory in the church
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:24.300]   "and in Christ Jesus
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:25.300]   "to all the generations
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:26.300]   "forever and ever.
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:27.300]   "Amen."
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.300]   Remember Luke chapter 5,
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.300]   when Jesus is calling his disciples,
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:32.300]   he says, "After fishing all night,
[01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:33.300]   "they didn't catch anything?"
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:35.300]   He says, "Throw it to the other side."
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:37.300]   To the other side.
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:39.300]   These professional fishermen,
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:41.300]   generational fishermen,
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.300]   and here's this carpenter.
[01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:43.300]   It's like, "Oh, maybe you just
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:45.300]   "didn't throw it onto the other side."
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:46.300]   Right?
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:49.300]   Anything that you and I are good at,
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:51.300]   we have a hard time trusting God.
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:52.300]   Right?
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.300]   So if you're good with numbers,
[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.300]   you don't trust God with the numbers.
[01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:58.300]   I can take care of this.
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.300]   Whatever you're gifted in,
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:02.300]   you have a problem trusting God in.
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:03.300]   These fishermen,
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:05.300]   they're like, "We fished all night."
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:07.300]   Like, "I know you're the Messiah,
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:10.300]   "but we're professional fishermen."
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.300]   And he says, "Simply because you said it,
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:12.300]   "I'm going to do it."
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:13.300]   And they throw it,
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.300]   and they catch.
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:15.300]   How did they catch it?
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:16.300]   They caught so much,
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.300]   it says the boat was sinking.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.300]   Well, why did he do that?
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:20.300]   Why don't you just catch just enough
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.300]   so they can come in and sell it
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:23.300]   and make some money?
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.300]   He was trying to make a point.
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:27.300]   He was trying to make a point.
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:31.300]   Him, who was able to do far more abundant,
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:34.300]   beyond your expectation.
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:35.300]   Philippians 4, 19-20,
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:37.300]   "And my God will supply all your needs
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:38.300]   "according to what?
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:41.300]   "His riches and glory in Christ Jesus."
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:43.300]   The purpose of this miracle
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:44.300]   was not simply to feed them.
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:45.300]   I mean, he had compassion on them,
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:47.300]   but it was to reveal his glory
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:50.300]   and what kind of glory
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.300]   that they needed to see.
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:52.300]   2 Corinthians 9, 8,
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:55.300]   "And God is able to make all grace abound to you
[01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:56.300]   "so that always,
[01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:58.300]   "having all sufficiency in everything,
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.300]   "you may have abundance
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.300]   "in every good deed."
[01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:05.300]   There's a reason why Jesus said,
[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:06.300]   "I have come to give life,"
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:09.300]   and to give this life what?
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:12.300]   Abundantly.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:15.300]   He didn't just save us from hell.
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:17.300]   He didn't just say,
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:18.300]   "I'm not going to punish you."
[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.300]   He said, "I'm going to give this life,
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:21.300]   "give this life abundantly,
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:23.300]   "beyond your expectation,
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:26.300]   "so that you know who I am."
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:28.300]   1 John 3, verse 1,
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:29.300]   "Behold, what manner of love is this,
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:33.300]   "that he lavished on us."
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.300]   He didn't just love us.
[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:35.300]   He says, "He lavished on us,
[01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:39.300]   "that we would be called the children of God."
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.300]   God demonstrates his love toward us
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:43.300]   in that while we were yet sinners,
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.300]   Christ died for us.
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:45.300]   He didn't come look for us
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:48.300]   because we were diamond in the rough,
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:49.300]   that we had some sort of potential.
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:50.300]   He's looking for people
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:54.300]   that is going to add to his kingdom.
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:58.300]   You know what's interesting about all of this?
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:01.300]   That after he performs his miracle,
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:02.300]   the Bible tells us
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:07.300]   that they wanted to forcefully make him king.
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:09.300]   They were excited.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:12.300]   They may have seen and heard about his miracles.
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:14.300]   Now every single person,
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:16.300]   all 20,000 plus people,
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:19.300]   tasted the miracle.
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.300]   Every single one of them.
[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:23.300]   They said, "Wow, if he can heal the sick,
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:25.300]   "he can control the demons,
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:27.300]   "he can even raise people from the dead,
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:30.300]   "and he's going to feed us?
[01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:33.300]   "He has to be our king."
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:34.300]   So Jesus takes a break
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.300]   and goes to the other side,
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.300]   and they follow him to the other side.
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:41.300]   "Jesus, where did you go?"
[01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:44.300]   And then Jesus sees right through them.
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:45.300]   "You're not coming to me
[01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:46.300]   "because you know who I am.
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:47.300]   "You're coming to me
[01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:50.300]   "because you ate and you want more."
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:53.300]   He says, "I am the bread of life."
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:54.300]   And he has a discussion back and forth,
[01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:58.300]   and he realizes that they don't really believe him.
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:01.300]   They just want the gift that he can give.
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:02.300]   And then he says to them,
[01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:03.300]   "If you do not drink of my blood
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:04.300]   "and eat of my flesh,
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:06.300]   "we have no relationship."
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:09.300]   And then in John 6, 66, it says,
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:10.300]   "From that moment on,
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:13.300]   "many of them turned away
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:16.300]   "and no longer followed him."
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:19.300]   Now here's the kicker.
[01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:23.300]   Jesus knew all this already.
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:29.300]   Jesus was not surprised by what he saw.
[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:31.300]   Jesus was not shocked.
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.300]   "How can you do this to me?"
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:34.300]   He knew all of this
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:38.300]   when he saw them running to him.
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:41.300]   He knew the very next day
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:42.300]   the majority of these people
[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:45.300]   are going to turn away from him.
[01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:47.300]   And yet when he saw them,
[01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:51.300]   he had compassion.
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:55.300]   He had compassion.
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:58.300]   Think about the way you and I respond
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:01.300]   when we see Phil.
[01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:02.300]   You go to a restaurant,
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:05.300]   and the waitress doesn't treat you correctly,
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:07.300]   one star.
[01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:09.300]   Don't ever come to this store again.
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:10.300]   People come to our church,
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:12.300]   and maybe somebody didn't welcome you
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.300]   the way you wanted to be welcomed.
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:16.300]   Brilliant.
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.300]   Never coming here again.
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:19.300]   You know, I came here trying to park the car,
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:21.300]   and I have nowhere to park the car,
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.300]   and these guys weren't telling me where to go.
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:26.300]   What kind of a church is this?
[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:27.300]   I don't know how many people say,
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:28.300]   "I don't want to go to that church
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:32.300]   "because they're not very welcoming."
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:33.300]   We buy a house,
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:35.300]   and we have neighbors
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:37.300]   who aren't acting a certain way.
[01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:38.300]   I can pack up and leave,
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:39.300]   go somewhere else.
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:43.300]   What kind of a neighborhood is this?
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:45.300]   Because that's a natural way
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:47.300]   that people respond.
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:49.300]   If we see filthy, if we see danger,

[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:54.300]   I'm not going to put up with that.
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:57.300]   Jesus saw all of it,
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:01.300]   and yet he had compassion.
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:04.300]   He didn't turn away from us.
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:07.300]   He came toward us,
[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:09.300]   and that while we were yet sinners,
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:13.300]   Christ died for us.
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:17.300]   That's why we come to worship him.
[01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:20.300]   That's why we adore him.
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:23.300]   That's why we await for his second coming
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:26.300]   because we wait for a savior
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:27.300]   who knows all our filth
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:31.300]   better than anybody else,
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:35.300]   and yet he calls us his children
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:38.300]   and invites us,
[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:40.300]   invites us to have confidence
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:42.300]   to enter the throne of grace
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:44.300]   that in times of need
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.300]   that we will find help,
[01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:48.300]   that even if everybody else
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:51.300]   is irritated by our weaknesses,
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:55.300]   we have a savior who's compassionate.
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:58.300]   Don't you want to worship this God?

[01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:02.300]   Don't you want to tell the world
[01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:05.300]   about this God?
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:09.300]   May Christ and Christ alone
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:11.300]   be glorified in us.

[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:24.300]   Father, we thank you for who you are.

[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:41.300]   As we see the magnitude of your love

[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:47.300]   that all we can do for the rest of our lives

[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:52.300]   May Christ receive the reward
