[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.560]   - Welcome back to the podcast.
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.600]   Welcome to June, June 1st, a Thursday,

[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.180]   John Piper's sermons are now being curated
[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.620]   in a new podcast from Desiring God
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.740]   called Light and Truth, Light and Truth.
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.700]   So if you want your five days a week
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.340]   fill of John Piper sermons, old sermons and new sermons,
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.820]   subscribe to our new podcast, Light and Truth.
[00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.580]   And I'm sure many of you already have.
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.100]   But on this Thursday episode,
[00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.820]   we're back in studio with Pastor John
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.260]   to field a question from Dustin in Indianapolis, Indiana.
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.180]   He writes this, "Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.580]   "In light of 1 Timothy 2, verses one to four,
[00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.520]   "how are we to pray for unrighteous leaders?
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.620]   "How about presidents and other politicians?
[00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.940]   "How do you do it?
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.200]   "And what specifically do you pray for?"
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.060]   - Let's read the text that Dustin is referring to
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.020]   so that we can be specific.
[00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.980]   It's 1 Timothy 2, one to four, I'll read.
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.620]   "First of all then, I urge that supplications, prayers,
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.620]   "intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people,
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.620]   "for kings and all who are in high positions,
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.560]   "that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life,
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.460]   "godly and dignified in every way.
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.100]   "This is good and it is pleasing
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.460]   "in the sight of God our Savior,
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.580]   "who desires all people to be saved
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.300]   "and to come to a knowledge of the truth."
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.020]   So Paul is calling for Christians to pray for all people.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.640]   We focus on the kings, but it says all people.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.700]   I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions,
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.900]   thanksgivings be made for all people.
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.580]   And then the kings and all those in high positions
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.800]   are a subset of all people.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.740]   They are mentioned explicitly, I think,
[00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.560]   because they are especially relevant
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.820]   for the purpose of the prayer mentioned in the next clause,
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.720]   namely that we may lead a life that's peaceful and quiet,
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.680]   godly, dignified in every way.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.080]   So I take the all people to mean
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.060]   that wherever we look in the world
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.100]   and see people who might in some way make decisions
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.720]   that have a bearing on the circumstances
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.840]   in which Christians live, we should give thanks,
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.720]   underline that, thanksgiving for all people,
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.300]   we should give thanks for whatever proper role they fill,
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.300]   and we should ask God to incline their thoughts
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.420]   and incline their wills toward those decisions
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.700]   which carve out a space of justice and peace and freedom
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.460]   that allow Christians and others to live out our faith
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.880]   without physical resistance and without tumults
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.940]   and lawlessness and mob rule and war.
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.540]   That would include using their civil powers
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.660]   to restrain different forms of injustices.
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.660]   So there are two levels at which we pray
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.260]   for people in high positions.
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.680]   One is that they be saved.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.640]   And Paul said in Romans 10, one,
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.720]   "My heart's desire and prayer to God for them
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.760]   is that they may be saved."
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.080]   And he was referring to his Jewish kinsmen,
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.380]   whatever their rank, whether they're a high priest
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.640]   or a synagogue ruler or just an ordinary Jewish person,
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.660]   he's praying, "God, save my kinsmen."
[00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.840]   So that's what we do for all people
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.240]   who come into our mind, we ask God to save them,
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.440]   to show them the truth and beauty of Christ
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.740]   and to incline their hearts,
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.340]   to believe and embrace Christ as their savior
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.500]   and Lord and treasure.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.460]   Our hope as we pray this is that they will then,
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.900]   if they have any kind of authority at all,
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.220]   they will then see more clearly
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.300]   which decisions they have to make
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.620]   are just and peaceable and freedom loving
[00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.260]   so that some measure of freedom and justice and peace
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.660]   can be established so we can go about our lives
[00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.220]   without tumult or attack.
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.060]   That's one level, salvation.
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.100]   The other level of prayer is for leaders,
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.740]   even if the first prayer is not answered right away,
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.240]   namely for their salvation,
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.740]   even if that's not going to happen right away,
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.140]   we keep on praying for them.
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.260]   Paul does not say to pray only for Christian leaders
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.740]   or only that leaders become Christian.
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.740]   In fact, it seems to me that Paul assumes in this context
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.580]   that most of the leaders Timothy would be praying for
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.340]   are not Christians.
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.860]   They're mainly Roman officials at various levels,
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.780]   emperor, governors, military leaders, town justices,
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.900]   as well as some Jewish synagogue leaders and so on.
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.380]   They're virtually all unbelievers.
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.100]   That's what he's mainly referring to.
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.340]   And the way we pray for unbelievers
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.420]   besides praying for their conversion
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.020]   is at the second level I'm talking about,
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.980]   namely the level of providence.
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.900]   At least that's one way to describe it.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.060]   We know from scripture, Proverbs 21, 1,
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:12.060]   the king's heart is a stream of water
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.780]   in the hand of the Lord.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.820]   He turns it wherever he will.
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.940]   Now that's true of all kings, rulers,
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.580]   whether they're godly or not.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.580]   So we pray that God in his all governing providence
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.780]   over unbelievers and believers will incline the thoughts
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.780]   and the wills of non-Christian rulers to make decisions,
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.880]   even within their limited framework of right and wrong,
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:49.200]   that are just and freedom-producing and peace-producing
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.560]   so that those things that would enable Christians
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.080]   to proceed with their ordinary lives would hold sway.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.080]   And I think the way Paul calls for prayer for leaders
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.400]   contains a warning for us of how not to think
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.560]   about the role of rulers in relation to the Christian faith.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.120]   In spite of what I said about praying for their conversion,
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.280]   which is what we do for all people,
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.880]   that's not what Paul focuses on in this text.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.600]   Paul is writing in a situation
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.560]   in which civil authorities are virtually all non-Christian.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.060]   They may be ignorant of the Christian faith.
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.060]   They may be neutral.
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.000]   They may be hostile.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   So Paul's foremost thought is not that these prayers
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.040]   are prayers for Christian advocacy.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.600]   I think this is crucial.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.680]   He's not telling us to pray that civil authorities
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.440]   would become a conscious weapon
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.780]   of explicitly Christian promotion of the faith.
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:04.760]   He's thinking about pagan rulers who remain pagan
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.520]   but still are influenced by the providence of God
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.600]   to bring about in their limited, godless framework
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.480]   some measure of justice and peace and freedom.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.640]   Christians benefit from this, as others do,
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.480]   but this providence of God is not an example
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.840]   of Christians trying to turn state power
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.780]   into an explicit promoter of Christ's spiritual kingdom.
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.940]   Now, the reason I mentioned that warning
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.940]   is because Jesus said to Pilate at his trial,
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:49.260]   this is John 18, 36, "My kingdom is not of this world.
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:54.880]   If my kingdom were of this world,
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.640]   my servants would have been fighting
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.460]   that I might not be delivered over to the Jews,
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:06.180]   but my kingdom is not from the world."
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.700]   In other words, Jesus was eager
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.660]   that Christians not look to civil authorities
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.780]   for the establishment of his kingdom on earth.
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.060]   The way the state keeps the peace
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.820]   and the way Christ spreads his saving rule
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.020]   are radically different.
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.500]   So we don't pray that the state
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.160]   become an arm of the church.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.700]   We don't pray as if the kingdom of God,
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.700]   the saving reign of Christ, is of this world
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.340]   or that it would be advanced
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.460]   through an explicitly Christian use of the sword.
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:51.940]   Rather, we pray that God would have mercy on us
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.380]   and on the world whom he aims for us to evangelize
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:01.100]   in this text and would cause the hearts of presidents
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.420]   and governors and mayors and legislators
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.900]   to make decisions that bring about justice
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:12.380]   and peace and freedom so that we can go about our lives
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.540]   of worship and godliness and love
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:19.060]   and evangelism and world missions.
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:19.900]   - Amen.
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.180]   He has a good warning here about misreading this text
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.060]   as political advocacy.
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.660]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.340]   And thank you for joining us today.
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.900]   If you want to ask Pastor John, email us your question.

[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.380]   Next week, we have two questions about pastoring.
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.740]   Can single men pastor?
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:46.580]   That's on Monday.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.100]   Can single men pastor?
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.620]   And then how much should pastors make?
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.180]   That's Thursday.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.020]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke.
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.860]   Pastor John and I will see you next week.
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:56.900]   Have a great weekend.
