[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.780]   Okay, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 9, and I'm going to be reading
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.920]   from verse 25 through 29.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:19.900]   Romans chapter 9, verse 25 through 29.
[00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.620]   As indeed he says in Hosea, "Those who are not my people I will call my people, and her
[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.960]   who is not beloved I will call beloved.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.680]   And in the very place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' there they
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.600]   will be called sons of the living God.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.980]   And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, 'Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.020]   sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will be saved.
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.400]   For the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earth fully and without delay.'
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.920]   And as Isaiah predicted, 'If the Lord of hosts had not left us offspring, we would have been
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.320]   like Sodom and become like Gomorrah.'"
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.960]   Let's pray.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.520]   Gracious Father, we ask that you would anoint this time, that your word, that your living
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.360]   word would go forth and would judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.760]   We pray, Father God, that you give us fertile ground of hearts to listen, to apply, to be
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.200]   eager, Lord God, to hear from you.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.560]   I pray that you would filter every word that comes out of this mouth, that it may be used
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.200]   for your grace, for your glory.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.960]   So we ask for your Holy Spirit to guide and lead us and empower us.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.680]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.480]   Again, we're jumping back into the book of Romans and as you know, Apostle Paul has been
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.200]   going over the details of the gospel and he's been answering in the last maybe about three
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.200]   or four weeks that we were together in the book of Romans.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.000]   In the book chapter nine, he's been answering the question, if the gospel of grace is true,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.520]   what does that mean for the nation of Israel?
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.500]   Does it mean that God has changed his plan?
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.920]   Is God going another direction?
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.080]   So Paul has been expositing and he's been going through the Old Testament, he's been
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.220]   going through various passages to declare that our God is the same.
[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.040]   What I want to go through today, and I'm just going to jump right into the text this morning.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.600]   The three things that we want to observe from this passage, because again, this is connected
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.960]   to the previous chapters, and the three things that we want to convey through this text of
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.200]   observation I want you to see is that one, that the gospel that he is declaring is the
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.440]   same in the Old Testament and in the New Testament.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.240]   That's point one, and we're going to take some time to talk about that.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.920]   The point two is the gospel that he is declaring was always meant for the world and not just
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.920]   for Israel.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.400]   The gospel was always meant for the world, not just for Israel.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.680]   Third, the gospel reveals God's severity and his mercy, both.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.000]   So we're going to use that as an outline to kind of work through the text this morning.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.960]   But the first thing that we want to look at that Paul has been arguing, and he will continue
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.720]   to argue in this text, is that the God of the Old Testament and the message of salvation
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.520]   is the same as the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.720]   See again, you and I lived during an era where, not just during an era, but in a place of
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.200]   the world where the New Testament is probably about 95% of the preaching and the teaching
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.600]   that you hear in our generation in this particular part of the world is primarily coming from
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.840]   the New Testament.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.520]   Now that in and of itself is not a problem, because the New Testament is also the Bible,
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.520]   so as long as we're learning the Bible, but there's a reason why two-thirds of the Bible
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.880]   is the Old Testament.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.400]   And we have a tendency to kind of gravitate toward the New Testament because we superficially
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.160]   think that the God of the New Testament is an easier sell.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.200]   In fact, you hear a lot of non-Christians, the politicians, they'll talk about certain
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.480]   verses that are being quoted in the New Testament, that love is patient and is kind, and certain
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.600]   verses that are romantic or certain verses that may be useful for their political gain.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.800]   But whenever they come to the Old Testament, they always mention about stoning homosexuals,
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.720]   or if they're disobedient to parents, there's capital punishment if you don't obey the Sabbath
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.480]   and certain dietary laws.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.280]   And so, because the Old Testament, at least on the surface, seems like it's a more difficult
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.280]   sell.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.360]   It's a lot harder to explain the God of the Old Testament, so our tendency is to gravitate
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.840]   toward the New Testament.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.280]   Now, I've always known that this to be true, but it was confirmed for me many years ago
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.120]   when our pastoral staff, I think, no, the very first one, it was me and a couple of
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.000]   my pastor friends, we attended together for the gospel.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.240]   And at that time, the presider asked, "How many of you, out of 3,500 pastors, how many
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.600]   of you are preaching through the Old Testament?"
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.240]   It just happened at that time, I happened to be in the Old Testament.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.240]   So we stood up and, to my surprise, there was only about 11 to 12 people standing.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.920]   And so we were all shocked that out of this many pastors, two-thirds of the Bible being
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.680]   the Old Testament, that a very, very small percentage of people were actually teaching
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.680]   through the Old Testament.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.120]   Now, it doesn't mean that it's not being read.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.440]   It's not saying that it's not being quoted, but to teach systematically through the Old
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.440]   Testament.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.560]   Now, I didn't have to be at that conference to recognize that because when I was going
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.000]   through at that time, through the Old Testament, I found out that there's maybe about one-tenth
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.280]   of the study material available in the Old Testament than it is in the New Testament.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.080]   In fact, any passage in the New Testament, if you go online saying, you know, Romans
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.680]   chapter 9, verse 25, you'll probably find, you know, several pages of sermons about,
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.660]   you know, documents and somebody's study on various words.
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.760]   You go to the Old Testament, you type in a passage, you might find maybe two sermons
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:14.560]   in the Book of Judges, three sermons on 1 Kings, maybe one sermon on Chronicles.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.560]   And so usually even the preaching through the Old Testament is very sparse.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:25.780]   And so if you try to go find material on the Old Testament to study, it's very, very sparse.
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.680]   So I had a very difficult time when we were going through the Old Testament.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.740]   I know a handful of you were there when we were doing that, that it was very difficult
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.840]   to like, well, what do we focus on and how do I preach this?
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.280]   And week after week because I had toâ€¦
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.520]   I didn't have a lot of examples to follow.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.140]   Now having said that, again, that conference only confirmed to me, and the reason why I
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:55.800]   bring all this up is because you and I live in a generation where the God that we know,
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:02.080]   at least majority of our paradigm of understanding of who God is, is coming from selective passages
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.600]   in the New Testament.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:09.560]   Again, like I said, that in and of itself is not a problem.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:16.800]   But a problem or a danger that that can cause is that we don't have this concept, we don't
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.640]   have this understanding of weightiness of who God is because God spends thousands of
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:29.800]   years trying to teach the nation of Israel and ultimately to the world who He is.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.960]   And that when we come to the New Testament and reveal the necessity of the cross, it
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.580]   was more than several thousand years of preparation through the tabernacle, through the giving
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:45.200]   of the law, through the history, through the various festivals of the nation of Israel,
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.960]   through God's judgment and restoration over and over again, revelation of God's character
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.320]   and who He is.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.680]   And all of that played as a foundation so that when Christ came, that there would be
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:04.120]   this recognition that there is a dire need for a Savior.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.680]   When we see the God of the Old Testament disconnected with the God of the New Testament, or somehow
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.720]   different, we have clearly missed the point.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.440]   So if you happen to read the Old Testament and superficially look at it and say, "Wow,
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.320]   the God of the Old Testament seems like a different God," I strongly encourage you
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.600]   to go back and read it.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.560]   And this is not just a pastor talking.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.560]   Go back and read it.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.500]   I mean, really thoroughly read it, just like you read the New Testament.
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.040]   Read verse by verse, chapter by chapter, and really understand the context, not just certain
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:41.280]   verses that are taken as a quote, but I'm really talking about reading it.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.080]   You will find the same God in the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.360]   But until you see the same God of the Old Testament and the New Testament, there's a
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.760]   disconnect in how you understand the Gospel.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.360]   Because that's how the Gospel was presented to us.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:09:01.160]   See, by the time we get to the New Testament, we're standing upon thousands of years God's
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:06.280]   preparation so that the nation of Israel will be to recognize their sins.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:12.520]   See, if you go to the God of the Old Testament, God spends all that time setting up the temple,
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.800]   the tabernacle, the giving of the law, and the first thing that impression that you get
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.300]   from the Old Testament is God doesn't say, "Come."
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.300]   That's not what He says.
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.240]   He doesn't say, "Here I am.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.760]   I'm so gentle and caring and merciful.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.760]   Just come."
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.520]   That's not the God that we see in the Old Testament.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.900]   The God of the Old Testament basically says, "Stay away.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:41.780]   That if you draw near to me with dirty hands, you will die."
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:47.920]   And so all the process of the tabernacle is a process of warning people, "Do not come
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.060]   to me.
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:54.400]   And if you do come, you must follow exactly what I tell you to do."
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:00.120]   So if you remember in Leviticus chapter 10, after he establishes the law of how to draw
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.520]   near to him, the very first two priests that come, they offer up strange fire.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.720]   Remember what happens to them?
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.180]   They get consumed and God destroys them.
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.880]   And He says, "Anyone who comes to me, I will show myself as holy."
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.760]   Now does that sound like an inviting God?
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.800]   The very first two priests that come because they offered something that was not prescribed,
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.160]   they get consumed and they die.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.520]   Now if that was isolated incident and we say, "Well, that happened in Old Testament, but
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.200]   you know, later on, God just kind of softened up."
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.260]   That is not the case.
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:42.580]   The whole stretching out of Israel's history is revelation of God who is holy, holy, holy.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.720]   That a sinful man is not able to be in His presence.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:52.480]   And so if we understood His nature, we would understand why the nation of Israel, every
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.600]   time they broke God's commandment, judgment came upon them, just like God said.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.440]   So when we come to the New Testament, we say, "Well, that's not the God of the New Testament
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.640]   since God consumed all His wrath upon Jesus."
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:10.240]   But you will study, when you study the New Testament carefully, you will find that that
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.440]   same God who detests sin of the Old Testament is the same God of the New Testament.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.520]   And if you don't recognize that in the New Testament, again, I strongly encourage you
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.480]   to go back, read the New Testament systematically.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:27.080]   Don't just take verses here and there and it is being quoted in sermons, but study through
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.120]   the Gospels.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.960]   Study through Hebrews, study through Romans, study through the book of James, study Revelation.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.560]   If you don't get it, we'll study through Revelation and you'll see.
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.720]   It is the same God of the Old Testament.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.440]   Or vice versa, you may look at the Old Testament and say, "Wow, God is so vengeful and hateful
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.100]   and you know, He can't stand it, He's just quick to judge."
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.240]   Study the Old Testament carefully, see if you don't see a patient and merciful God of
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.240]   the Old Testament.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.880]   He is the same God.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.840]   Now why is this important?
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.040]   It's important because the nation of Israel, like Paul is writing this letter, this Gospel
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:08.840]   to the nation of Israel, and Israel is having a hard time reconciling the God that they
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.040]   thought that they knew.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:17.960]   And so when Paul says this salvation is not of the law, but is by grace.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.880]   It has always been by grace.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.260]   It's not by race, but by grace.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.400]   And that's the part where they had a hard time reconciling.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:30.240]   So the God that we knew was you have to keep the law and if you keep the law, God blesses
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.240]   you.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.240]   If you don't keep the law, God's going to curse you.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:38.280]   And so we just thought that that was the God that we worshipped.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:44.440]   You and I live in a generation where we try to kind of at least water down hell and judgment
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.480]   and wrath of God because it's a difficult self, right?
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.160]   At least where you and I live.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.680]   So kind of water that down, we emphasize certain things that would be more palatable to people.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:03.760]   Well Israel, their issue with the Gospel is completely the opposite.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:10.040]   Which was, well if what you're saying is right, if Gospel is by grace alone, this is
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.840]   a God that we couldn't approach.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.040]   This is the God that we came to the temple and we had all these regulations to get to
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.040]   Him.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.840]   This is the God who wiped out the earth because they didn't obey.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.960]   This is a God who sent His own people into captivity for 70 years because they wouldn't
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.360]   keep the law.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:32.200]   Now you're saying that the Jews and the Gentiles are going to be saved simply by grace, by
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.320]   faith?
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.480]   They have the exact opposite problem.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.720]   How can that holy God be the same God that you're preaching?
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.100]   That doesn't make sense.
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.000]   So the problem that our generation have of like, wow, if God is so loving and generous
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.400]   and caring, how can He judge anybody where the Jews had an issue with the exact opposite?
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.360]   If God is a holy, holy, holy God that we've been taught that we can't even mention His
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.080]   name.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.200]   And now you're saying that even the Gentiles were pagans and eating whatever they want,
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.480]   now they can enter the throne of grace just like us?
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.800]   How could that be?
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:14.320]   That is why Paul has been spending all this time expositing the Old Testament.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.000]   That the gospel that he's been presenting in the first eight chapters of Romans is the
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.960]   same God of the Old Testament.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.600]   That's why he says, he gives the example of Isaac and Ishmael.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.360]   Ishmael should have been the rightful heir because he was the son of the flesh, but he
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.560]   said no, Isaac is the son of the promise.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.760]   He gives the example of Jacob and Esau.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.480]   Esau being the older brother should have been the heir.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.400]   Instead, God chooses Jacob by His sovereign plan.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.040]   He said, well, does that mean that there's any kind of injustice in God?
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.120]   How can that be if He just sovereignly chooses?
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.640]   Again he gives the example in Exodus 33, 19, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.600]   I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.080]   And he gives an example of how he dealt with Israel and the nation of Egypt.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.200]   As an example of all the things that you're protesting has always been.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.920]   That's how God has always worked.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:15.120]   And then finally he said, well, if the gospel is true, how can he find fault?
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.240]   Again he goes to the Old Testament.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.720]   He gives the illustration of how we are the clay and he is the potter.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:26.320]   How can we dare come before God and put him in the trial seat and say, well, if you don't
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.320]   prove yourself to me, I'm going to reject you.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.560]   Again going back to, have you forgotten who God is?
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.320]   Who are you, oh man, to question God?
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.000]   Even the potter has the right to do this.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.160]   In other words, he may be beyond you, but don't forget who God is.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:50.040]   So he's been systematically arguing through the Old Testament to teach us that this is
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.040]   the same God.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.440]   Now, before I move on to the second point, I want to emphasize this.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:04.840]   Because you and I, again, because we've been saturated in one end, right?
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:10.960]   Where certain passages have been taken, maybe even in context have been taken to highlight
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:17.160]   certain aspects of the gospel and certain aspects of God's character.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:22.120]   If we're not careful, we can have an incomplete picture of our God.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:28.440]   Because it is not just important, it is absolutely essential that you understand who God is.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.960]   To understand what he does.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:38.280]   The God of the Old Testament who detests sin is the same God of the New Testament.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:43.000]   A God who looked at the earth and because of their multiplication of their sin and said,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.760]   "I have had enough," and he wipes them all out and only allows eight to survive to repopulate
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.760]   the earth.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:55.960]   That's that same God who crucifies his son to save us.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.620]   It's that same God.
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:03.120]   So if we don't recognize, if we don't see the cross in the light of the totality of
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.900]   God revealed to us in the Old and the New Testament, there's always going to be something
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.800]   about the gospel that we don't understand.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.980]   And typically what happens is when we don't understand, we just kind of sweep it under
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.320]   the rug.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.320]   We don't have a good answer for it.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.560]   So we just kind of like emphasize certain things and then when you talk about hell,
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:26.000]   kind of like, yeah, it's there, you know, you get separated from God, but we don't talk
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.200]   about the torment.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.440]   We don't talk about the punishment that is eternal.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:35.840]   Because it's difficult for us to explain because the God that we've created in our generation,
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.200]   it's hard for us to reconcile all of that.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.600]   We have to make sure that the gospel we understand and proclaim is the gospel that comes from
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.480]   the full counsel of God, all of God.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:55.920]   And our life and our application and our obedience is coming from the full counsel of God, not
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.360]   just taking one over the other.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:06.360]   See, Paul is trying to bring God in the gospel of the whole Bible.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.760]   It may not sit well with some people.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.720]   There's certain things that the Gentiles had a problem with.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:15.440]   There's certain things that the Jews had a problem with, but the gospel itself was never
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.900]   compromised.
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:18.900]   God does not change.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.280]   He does not change the core of his message and how somebody is saved because you have
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.400]   a harder time, or that person has a harder time, because he's the potter.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.280]   We are the clay.
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:35.920]   So the first thing that we wanted to continue on is the message that he's been giving, that
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.200]   God of the Old Testament is the same God of the New Testament.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.880]   The second part is where I want to spend more time on, is that the gospel has always been
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.480]   for the world, not just for the Jews.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.280]   The gospel has always been for the world and not just for the Jews.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.560]   He quotes Hosea chapter 2 in verse 25.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:00.520]   He says, "Indeed," he says to Hosea, "those who are not my people, I will call my people,
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:05.000]   and her who is not beloved, I will call beloved."
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.080]   And then he quotes Hosea 1, "And in this very place where it was said to them, 'You are
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:13.360]   not my people,' there they will be called sons of the living God."
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.480]   So if you look at that text in the book of Hosea, you'll know, if you've ever studied
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:22.600]   the book of Hosea, that passage is referring to Israel, not Gentiles.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.960]   Paul here seems to be referring to the Gentiles.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:30.560]   In other words, you mean all the Gentiles are coming to faith?
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:36.600]   And he uses this text that was originally used for the Jews in saying, see, God has
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.480]   always intended to bring people who were not his people and make them his people.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.040]   So how do we reconcile that?
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.800]   Is Paul just kind of taking liberty to apply it any way he wants, or is this a legitimate
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.080]   use of this text because it was meant for the Jews?
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.960]   I think if you were studying this text, that's a legitimate question to ask.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.480]   You have to understand, whenever you see prophecies in the Old Testament, and we're going to be
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.080]   going over this when we study the book of Revelation, there's always three applications
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.080]   of prophecy.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.120]   And it is true, the Old Testament is true, the New Testament.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.160]   There's an immediate historical application, there's an application in the second coming
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.240]   of Christ, and there's an application at the end times.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:21.960]   So when you look at this prophecy in Hosea, basically God was telling them that because
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:27.600]   of their many sins, God says, I'm going to release you to your sins and I'm going to
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.560]   treat you like an unbeliever.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.720]   And he actually tells them to name your children, you are not my people, you are not loved.
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.520]   And that's not at the end of Hosea, it begins like that.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:46.480]   And then so the rest of Hosea is a proclamation of the reason why God came to that point.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.080]   So those of you who study the book of Hosea and say, wow, you know, God loves us despite
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.200]   all our adultery and sins, he still loves us.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.520]   Now that may be true, but the book of Hosea is not written that way.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.800]   Book of Hosea begins with judgment, that God's going to call you not my people, you're not
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.820]   going to be beloved, and here's the reason why.
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:09.480]   He tells Hosea to go marry a wife named Gomer who was a prostitute, and he said, you're
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:14.100]   going to marry her and she's going to keep committing adultery, but I'm going to command
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.880]   you to keep going after her and reconcile with her and love her despite.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.400]   And then it's going to come to a point where God's going to turn around and he's going
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.360]   to indict the nation of Israel, this is you.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.240]   And this is the reason why God is going to treat you like the Gentiles, like you are
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:34.040]   outside of the covenant because you kept on breaking my covenant and I'm going to release
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.600]   you to that.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:44.000]   Now why does he use that to convey that the gospel was meant for the Gentiles?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.080]   Because though he proclaims that, he says, because of your many sins I've released you
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.880]   and you've broken the covenant, it is no longer relevant because now you are not my people,
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:58.240]   I'm going to treat you as if my love and my protection is not upon you, but despite that,
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:03.080]   he said, there's going to come a time in this very place where I told you that this covenant
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:08.520]   was broken, you're not my people, he said, I will call you again and call you my people.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:13.160]   In fact, he'll go further than that, he'll completely restore you and call you sons of
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.560]   the living God.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:24.920]   Now the relevance of all of this is that the reason why the nation of Israel missed this
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:30.400]   and why they had such a hard time reconciling the gospel, even though the gospel first came
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.240]   to them, it was embedded into their culture, the reason why they missed it is because they
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:40.240]   forgot that they were simple instruments for his glory.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.560]   If you read the Old Testament, New Testament, there is one theme.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:48.480]   And if you ever read any part of the Old Testament or the New Testament and you don't catch the
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.240]   seam, you probably misread it.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.200]   The theme is God is in pursuit of his own glory.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:01.520]   That theme is throughout every single chapter, every single historical document that you
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.520]   will read.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:07.120]   It's all about God pursuing his glory and he's pursuing his glory and the means to which
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:12.200]   he pursues his glory is by pursuing sinful men.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.840]   Salvation of sinners.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:19.000]   So his ultimate purpose is to declare his glory and the way he's going to declare his
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.760]   glory is by pursuing sinners and bringing them to salvation.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:29.000]   That's the underlying theme of the Old Testament and New Testament, every part, even book of
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.800]   numbers, even Leviticus, even Revelation, it's that same theme.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:41.520]   God pursues his glory by the means of pursuing sinners.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.400]   Where the nation of Israel missed all of this was, and I think the best way to illustrate
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.960]   this is to tell you a parable about the pride of the rooster.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.920]   Some of you guys may have heard this before, may not have heard this, but basically the
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.800]   pride of the rooster is, you know, the rooster, you know, lived on a farm.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.560]   He was the only rooster and every morning he would wake up and he would crow.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.560]   Cock-a-doodle-doo.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.560]   Right?
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:06.280]   I was trying to do that this morning and then my throat hurt so I can't do it.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.280]   Cock-a-doodle-doo.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.360]   So you can imagine, right?
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:13.320]   So if you've ever been on a farm early in the morning, you'll hear a rooster, cock-a-doodle-doo
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.240]   five in the morning.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:20.140]   And this rooster thought that the sun came up because of him, that he was the one who
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:24.280]   raised the sun every morning because every time he cock-a-doodle-doo, the sun would come
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.280]   up.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.760]   And so he'd walk around in pride.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.840]   And so all the farm animals, the cows and the chickens and the goats would look at that
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.520]   and they would look with envy.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:41.520]   He said, "Wow, that rooster, you know, on the surface looks like nothing, but without
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.520]   him we wouldn't have the sun."
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:49.200]   Now everybody suspected that maybe it wasn't him, but nobody knew for sure because every
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.840]   morning he would crow and the sun would come up.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:58.840]   Well one day he was walking around and he tripped and he hurt his neck.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.320]   And so he lost his voice, right?
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:08.400]   And so he was worried all day long, like how, if I don't crow tomorrow morning, if I don't
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.360]   cock-a-doodle-doo tomorrow morning, the sun's not going to come up, the farm is going to
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:16.040]   die, the cow is going to die, they're all so dependent upon me, you know?
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:20.120]   So he couldn't sleep all night and he was thinking about all these different ways to
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.200]   bring the sun out.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.200]   Maybe he can fake his voice.
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.760]   Is there a recording of my voice somewhere?
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.760]   And he couldn't figure it out.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.400]   And sure enough, five o'clock came and the sun came up.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.480]   He said, "Huh, it still came up.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.720]   Something must have gone wrong."
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.800]   So he thought maybe it was a special day.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.420]   So he waited another day and was trying to figure it out.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:45.680]   Next morning came, sure enough, he couldn't crow and his voice doesn't yield.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.960]   And the sun still came up.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:53.480]   And after about a week or two, he realized, "Hmm, maybe it wasn't me after all."
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:58.280]   So he became humbled, right?
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:05.440]   That's the parable about the humility or the pride of the chicken, right?
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.600]   The rooster.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.760]   See that's exactly what happened to the nation of Israel.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.360]   The nation of Israel, God said from the very beginning, He said, "Do not think that if
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:21.200]   I let you get into the promised land, that it is because you are a greater nation than
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.200]   any other nation.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.860]   It's not because you are more righteous than anybody.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:28.780]   In fact," He said, "You are very stiff-necked.
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:34.400]   You deserve the same judgment that the Canaanites deserve because you will continue to always
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.720]   forget me and you will continue to worship idols."
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.820]   He said, "I am choosing you because I have a greater purpose and I'm going to use you
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.120]   as my instrument."
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:48.820]   And the nation of Israel, instead of recognizing that they were just instruments for God's
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.200]   greater purpose, they thought that they were it.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.000]   And so they had a hard time with the Gentiles.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.080]   Like we had the patriarchs, we had the law, we had the prophets, we had all of this.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:05.080]   And now you're going to simply say that the Gentiles are just going to come in by faith?
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:09.560]   That's why so much of the New Testament is written to combat these Judaizers because
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.440]   they just couldn't let go.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.920]   I thought God was glorified because of us.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.680]   And that's why Paul says in the book of Romans, he's like, "God is not glorified because of
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.680]   you.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.240]   God is blasphemed because of you."
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:26.040]   He said, "I thought the sun came up because we crowed."
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:32.680]   The nation of Israel, it filled them with pride and that's why he came after the Pharisees
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.040]   because that's exactly what the Pharisees were telling them.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.400]   It was because we're Jews that God was using us.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.880]   And it's because of us that God is gracious to the world.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:46.520]   And that's why they were resisting the gospel because the gospel basically says the door
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:53.040]   is open and is always intended to go to the world.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.320]   People ask all the time, "Why did they choose the nation of Israel?
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.440]   Why were they the special people?"
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.360]   Well, they were just chosen.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.760]   He could have chosen any nation.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:07.320]   He could have chosen any group because his ultimate purpose was always the world.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:12.480]   Matthew 8, 11 to 12, "I tell you, many will come from the east and the west and recline
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.360]   at the table, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:20.360]   While the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness in that place, there
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.720]   will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.080]   He always said it was for the world.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:33.080]   He said people who are not Abraham's physical descendants are going to come in.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.200]   And even while he is doing ministry, he kept on saying the kingdom of heaven is going to
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.320]   be for everybody.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.900]   Now why is this relevant to us?
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:50.400]   Because the same danger that the nation of Israel was under and why they had such a hard
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:57.800]   time accepting the gospel to the Gentiles is the same reason why we stop sometimes with
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.480]   our own salvation.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.560]   We get saved, our family is taken care of, bills are paid, and we start saving money
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.560]   for retirement.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:11.640]   And then there's always in the back of our mind, "Oh yeah, it's about the Great Commission."
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.140]   And you hear it at the church.
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.140]   You hear it at the church.
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.720]   You hear it talked about.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:21.120]   You know, we hear testimonies.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.440]   But that's not us.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.640]   And it's so easy to be filled with pride.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.240]   With desperation to need God.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:35.960]   It's so easy to make someone proud.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:41.880]   You fill them with a little bit of talent, immediately like, "Hmm, I'm better."
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.600]   They go to a little bit better school, "Hmm, my school's better than yours."
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.080]   Like, "I'm three centimeters taller than you.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:55.320]   You lift 150, I lift 158."
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.320]   You play JV?
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.320]   "I played varsity.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.960]   I was a CIFJ."
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.160]   It doesn't take much, right?
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.480]   You make how much?
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.860]   How old are you?
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.400]   It really doesn't take much.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.280]   It really doesn't take much.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:17.640]   Because there's just something inside, innately, kind of like, wanting to be somebody, and
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.600]   then all you have to do is like, "Wow, you're good," or, "Ooh, you're doing this," and
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.920]   boom.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:31.320]   Not realizing that that very nature, that instinct to be somebody, blinds us for our
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.160]   desperation for God.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.600]   We're easily like the roosters.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:43.960]   All the things that we have, maybe because I'm smart, maybe I got a raise, maybe these
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:47.960]   things are happening to me because I'm talented and I'm just a little bit smarter than everybody.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.160]   You'll never say that.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.920]   You're too smart to say that.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.960]   If you say that out loud, you know how you're going to be perceived, and then you're not
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.640]   going to be too smart.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:03.640]   But if you're really gifted and talented, you'll know how to convey that without saying
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.040]   that, so other people will say that about you.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.720]   Then you're really smart.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:12.320]   It doesn't take much to fill us with pride.
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.680]   Once that pride creeps in, it ruins us.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.400]   The nation of Israel just could not accept the gospel to the nations because they thought
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.520]   that their God was exclusive to them and said, "Well, okay, we're going to be generous.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:29.040]   We'll let the Gentiles in, but they need to first do everything that we've done.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.320]   They need to put in their time.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.600]   They need to do everything that we've done."
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.280]   You know, that happens in the church too.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.280]   Be careful.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:42.120]   It happens in the church too, because I see every church that's been around for a while,
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:47.120]   there's always a group of people who are kind of like, "This is my church.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.120]   I've been here.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.120]   You've got to put in your time.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.400]   You've got to sacrifice, and I've given longer.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:55.000]   I've been here longer," and then that becomes a stumbling block.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   That's the nation of Israel.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:05.200]   They just couldn't accept that, but the gospel was always meant for the world.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.600]   Everything that God is doing.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.840]   Why does he bless a church?
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.000]   Why does he bless you?
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Why do you have what you have?
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   It's like, "Oh, God bless us so I can have a nice family and raise my children in safety."
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.120]   It's like, all of that is great.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:25.560]   But in God's big picture, in God's big picture of his will, what does that have to do with
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.720]   him?
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.920]   Is God serving you or are you serving God?
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.920]   What does that have to do with his big picture?
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:39.240]   So does it end with your blessing that you have money and you have safety and your children
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.240]   are saved?
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:45.160]   It was the whole goal of our life, that, to reach that, and then we're there, and then
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.440]   we thank God when we have it, and we don't thank God when we don't have it.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.440]   What was the purpose of that?
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:56.200]   If God's consistent line in the Old and the New Testament, everything that he has done
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:00.600]   and said was for the purpose of his glory and pursuing sinners, what does your wealth
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.000]   have to do with that?
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.480]   What does your health have to do with that?
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.980]   What does your youth, your talent, what does it have to do with that?
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:14.680]   If you don't see the connection, if you don't see the connection with all the blessing that
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:19.920]   God has given, with the bigger picture of what God is doing in human history, then you
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.600]   are outside the will of God.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:25.880]   I don't care how many times you read the Bible, I don't care how hard you serve the church
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:31.360]   or how much money you give, you are outside the will of God, because you have a chunk
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:37.240]   of things in your life, internal or external, that has nothing to do with God's greater
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.560]   plan.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:48.520]   Everything that he gives us is for the purpose of glorifying our Father and pursuing sinners.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:55.060]   That's why Israel had such a hard time understanding the gospel, because God's blessings stopped
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:56.060]   with them.
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:34:01.440]   If God came and overturned the Roman government and put Israel in the place of Rome, that
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:06.140]   would have been the end, at least to them.
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:11.400]   That's why they completely missed the Messiah, because the Messiah didn't come for Israel.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:16.640]   The Messiah came for the world.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:24.400]   Third and finally, the gospel shows, demonstrates God's severity and his mercy.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:28.280]   Romans chapter 11, in the summary of all of his argument of the gospel, he says, "Note
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.000]   then that the kindness and the severity of God."
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.520]   Let me stop right there.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.500]   Note the kindness and the severity of God.
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:41.860]   How often do we think of the gospel as God's revelation of God's severity?
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.180]   But yet that's what Paul says.
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:48.740]   In summary of the gospel message, before he gets to the imperatives in chapter 12, in
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:54.540]   totality it says, "Then consider the kindness and the severity of God, severity toward those
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:35:00.020]   who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness.
[00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:05.180]   Otherwise you too will be cut off, and even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief,
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:10.620]   will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again."
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:16.680]   He describes the gospel as the revelation of God's severity and his kindness.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:21.980]   In Numbers 14, 18, it says, "The Lord is slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love, forgiving
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:27.080]   iniquity and transgression, but he will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:31.680]   of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation."
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:38.040]   He quotes in verse 27, the passage in Isaiah, again a warning to the nation of Israel, "Though
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:42.800]   the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.800]   be saved."
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.600]   Basically in other words, you're saying God's going to bless your physical descendants and
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:53.560]   you're going to have descendants that's going to outnumber the sand, but despite that, despite
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:36:00.560]   that, he said only a few of you, only a few of you, a remnant will be saved.
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:05.480]   In other words, you can look at all the external things and say, "Well, God has blessed us,"
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:10.560]   and you can go to your grave thinking that, "Well, God's been so gracious and blessed
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:18.040]   us," but he said, "Among you, only a few will be saved."
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.320]   Now we can look at that and say, "Well, God's talking to the nation of Israel, he's not
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:27.680]   speaking to us who are at church raising our children and teaching them the gospel.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.520]   Is he talking to us?"
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:36.240]   Well, Jesus warned us in Matthew 7, 13, "Enter by the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:39.200]   the way is easy that leads to destruction.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:43.800]   Those who enter by it are many, for the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.860]   life and those who find it are few."
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:51.120]   Is that true today?
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:56.600]   Now we know it was true in the New Testament because they were being persecuted and it
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.960]   was very difficult to say, "You are a follower of Jesus Christ."
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:04.560]   We know that this is true in Egypt and in Iran and areas of the world where persecution
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.760]   is heavy, but is that true?
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:13.720]   I mean, on the surface, it looks exactly the opposite, right?
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:18.320]   If any of you fell away from your faith, you're going to have a hard time.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.320]   You know why?
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.680]   Because we're going to come after you.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.160]   We're going to come after you.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.840]   You have family and friends who are Christians, they're going to be worried about you sending
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.840]   emails.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:31.120]   We're going to be showing up at your door.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.120]   You can't play softball.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.120]   You know what I mean?
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.960]   You're not going to be able to hang around with them.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:37.960]   You're going to be uncomfortable.
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.280]   There's all kinds of pressure.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:48.720]   If you don't at least have a minimum obedience or minimum standard that you keep.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:54.080]   I mean, to be a Christian in our generation, you hear the gospel and are you interested?
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:55.080]   Yes.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.000]   Then become a member.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Become a member.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   We give you some gifts.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Here's some of your friends that you can hang out with and go drink boba with and play with.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   None of these things are evil.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.320]   None of these things are evil.
[00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:14.280]   But is it narrow?
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.280]   Let's be honest.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.280]   It's not narrow.
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.280]   It's broad.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:22.480]   It's very easy to be a follower of Jesus Christ in Orange County.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.480]   In fact, if you've been raised in the church and all of your friends are Christians, it's
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.200]   very hard not to be a Christian.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:33.440]   You're going to get persecuted for not coming to church.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.440]   I'm not exaggerating.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:37.880]   This is true, especially you college students.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.480]   You're surrounded by people like, "Where were you Wednesday?
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.160]   How come you didn't show up to this?
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.120]   We went and cleaned the church, but you didn't show up."
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:52.600]   You've got all kinds of persecution in the church for not being faithful.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:57.560]   The concern that they had was if you preach gospel by grace and it was that easy, that's
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.560]   it?
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.920]   Just believe?
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.280]   And then we're in a kingdom and then no one can touch us because we're saved by grace
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.720]   and not by work, so even if we fail, God's going to love us anyway?
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:12.640]   Wow, that doesn't sound narrow at all because it isn't.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.160]   So there's a temptation to go there.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.920]   Then you have the Jehovah's Witnesses and the different cults who say, "That doesn't
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.640]   sound right.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.400]   That's too easy because that's not what the Bible says."
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.400]   And then we're to the other end, so now you've got to prove yourself and no one can be sure
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:28.080]   of their salvation, and yet they completely contradict the scripture.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:33.000]   The scripture does say that, but here's the catch.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:43.800]   Salvation is by faith alone, but that faith has to be real.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:47.480]   That faith has to be real.
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.440]   Coming to church doesn't make it real.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.840]   Giving doesn't make it real.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.160]   Being a part of a community doesn't make it real.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.560]   Going out to short-term mission doesn't make it real.
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.880]   Preaching doesn't make it real.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:05.200]   None of that make it real.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:09.800]   Here's an illustration I've used so many times but I'm going to use again.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:16.600]   If I told you that this building is on fire and I said, "Do you believe me?"
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.600]   And you say, "Yes."
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:20.600]   And I said, "Really?
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.920]   You really believe me?"
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.400]   You say, "Yes."
[00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.000]   "You're absolutely certain what I said was true?"
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   "Yes."
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.080]   Then I'll say, "Well, that's kind of shocking."
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:34.280]   "So why is it shocking?"
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:37.120]   I'm kind of shocked that you say that you believe that.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.120]   It's like, "Why?
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.120]   It's so hard to believe."
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:45.160]   Because none of you are running.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.040]   Because none of you are getting out the door.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:51.840]   None of you are picking up your stuff and moving out.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:56.560]   And yet you tell me you are absolutely certain that this is true.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:01.720]   So something doesn't fit.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.560]   Something doesn't fit.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:11.560]   Either you believe that you're made out of Teflon so this fire is going to cause you
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:18.000]   no harm or you don't really believe what I'm saying.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.040]   But something doesn't fit.
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:29.920]   You and I live in Orange County where we live in a, I don't know how the best way to put
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:34.440]   it, lukewarmness is normal.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.480]   It's normal to be a lukewarm Christian.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.240]   It's normal to be nominal.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:45.200]   If anybody catches on fire with God, they're the weirdos.
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.200]   They're the Jesus freaks.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:49.320]   They're the ones who belong in a mission field.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:56.120]   You should go to seminary so you can let some of that out on the pulpit.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:02.720]   It's become weird to live consistently with our faith.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:06.840]   So yes, the gospel has not changed.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.280]   It's the same.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.960]   But it is by faith.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.760]   But it is by real faith.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:19.600]   Not superstition, not piggybacking off of other people, but real faith.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.960]   That's why he begins with a warning.
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:26.920]   He says, "Though there are many in number, only a remnant will be saved."
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:32.060]   And we have to understand the kindness of God in the context of understanding the severity
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.280]   of God.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:38.760]   Because if you don't understand the severity of God, the kindness of God, it sounds like
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:42.160]   a great-grandfather just passing out candy.
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:46.960]   No matter what you do, God is okay with it, and that's the generation that we have.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.600]   You can do whatever you want, say whatever you want.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.200]   It doesn't matter because one saved always saved.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:56.840]   Again, we understand the kindness of God without understanding the God that is presented to
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:00.680]   us through a totality of Scripture.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:07.560]   And why somebody who has no evidence of faith can have absolute assurance when it's completely
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.560]   unbiblical.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:14.840]   See, in Psalm 3119, it says, "Oh, how abundant is your goodness, which you have stored up
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:19.800]   for those who fear you, and worked for those who take refuge in you in the sight of the
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.000]   children of mankind."
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   Did you see that?
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.200]   He says that those who fear him are the ones that God will bless.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.280]   Did you see that?
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:37.360]   Psalm 3119, those who fear, they are the ones who will take refuge.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:41.880]   God reveals himself as a holy, holy, holy God.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.520]   And he says, "If the Lord's host had not left us offspring, we would have been like
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:49.400]   Sodom and we would have been like Gomorrah."
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.080]   Do we presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience not knowing that
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:58.640]   God's kindness is what leads us to repentance, the very reason why you're able to even think
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:04.600]   about God, why you're sitting here listening and even understanding anything if you feel
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:09.800]   guilty or convicted, any of that is because the kindness of God has allowed you to hear
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.320]   it and to understand it.
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:17.920]   Do you not understand that that in and of itself is God's kindness being revealed to
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.120]   us?
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:28.360]   How much of our complaining and excuses is because you and I live in first world, physically
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.360]   and spiritually.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:33.920]   Physically, look at the things that we complain about, the air conditioner, it's a little
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.600]   bit hot in here, right?
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.360]   No, you're okay?
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:39.000]   I'm hot.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.560]   The air conditioner just turned off, so I don't know what happened, right?
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.920]   I spent so much time this week trying to fix the air conditioner, you know, because I heard
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.280]   that the air conditioner downstairs wasn't working, so we had to get electricians to
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:53.240]   come in and various people, so we were here all day trying to connect that.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:57.200]   We got it connected downstairs, now we got to work on the upstairs.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:02.480]   So much of what we talk about, so much of the things that hinder us, like the rest of
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.040]   the world would be a joke.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:09.720]   We buy an iPhone 7 and then we hear that iPhone 8 is going to come out in the next couple
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.960]   months, like, "Dang it!"
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:17.640]   You know, I wasn't wise.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:22.240]   Traffic is miserable, the co-workers, they don't cooperate, they're incompetent, and
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:28.480]   you know, we think about all of these things, and we do that even spiritually.
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:32.280]   I can't grow because I don't have this, and I don't have that, and I don't have anybody
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:36.400]   my age, and I don't have anybody younger, I don't have anybody older, nobody like me,
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.400]   you know?
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:41.880]   I mean, we've got all kinds of reasons why we can't grow.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:48.120]   See, the kingdom of heaven in Matthew 13, 44 to 36 is, "The kingdom of heaven is like
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:52.880]   a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up, that in his joy he goes
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:57.040]   and sells all that he has and buys that field."
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.040]   Did you notice what he said?
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:03.800]   He said, when he encountered the kingdom of heaven, he's talking about Jesus, he's talking
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:09.520]   about his own salvation, that he recognized the value of it, and what did he sell?
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:11.920]   Everything.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:17.040]   Everything he had was worth selling to have Jesus.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.920]   Everything.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.920]   Again in verse 45, "Again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of pearls, who
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:28.880]   on finding one pearl of a great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it."
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.000]   What did this merchant do?
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.120]   He found this pearl, and he found the worth of it, and he sold everything in order to
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:37.680]   have it.
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:41.440]   You see, the kingdom of heaven, the gospel that he's talking about, is when an individual
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:47.520]   recognizing that that is worth more than anything else that I own, anything else I can possibly
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.240]   have in this world, so we sell everything.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:57.760]   He who finds his life shall lose it, and he who finds his life, loses his life for Christ,
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.720]   finds it.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:06.360]   The one who recognizes what it is that he has in Christ will find life.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:13.520]   And the ones who don't, at least in the church, will fake it, will salvage what he can, will
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:18.320]   go through the motions so that he can have friends and be a part of the community, but
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:22.960]   no life, no true joy.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.880]   Jesus is not your refuge.
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.520]   He's not your treasure.
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:29.520]   People are.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:30.920]   Circumstances are.
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.280]   Money is.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:38.880]   But true salvation is in Christ, in Christ alone.
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.360]   You know, it was interesting yesterday, we were going up and down, and as they were trying
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:46.960]   to fix the wires, there was a father and son team that was here, an electrician who was
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:53.060]   connecting these wires, and I was coming downstairs to check to make sure that it was working.
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:56.840]   So they were upstairs, and so I was coming up and down the stairs, up and down the stairs,
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:02.080]   and then the last time I was coming up the stairs, the son looked at me with envy, and
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.920]   he said, "Oh, I wish one day I could come up the stairs like you."
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.520]   And I was like, "Like me?
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.640]   I'm limping all over the place because my knee hurts."
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:17.160]   And the reason why he said that was because his son is in his 20s, he's like maybe 24,
[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:21.480]   25, but he got in a major motorcycle accident.
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:25.920]   And so he wasn't a Christian, but after he got in an accident, he was in the hospital
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:31.040]   for five months, and then he got out maybe about a month ago, so he's not in good condition
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.760]   to be able to work, so he's always limping around.
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:37.560]   You could tell it permanently damaged his leg, so he's always limping around.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:40.560]   And so it was interesting, it just kind of caught me off guard because here's this young
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.840]   man, and he's looking at me with envy.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.320]   I wish I had your legs, like what?
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:51.320]   I've never heard that before, ever.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:54.040]   I would never hear somebody say, "I envy your legs."
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.160]   Like what?
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:04.780]   But then again, it caught me off guard, and I was like, "Huh, it's because of his accident."
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:11.200]   And then it kind of made me look, "Yeah, my legs aren't good, but it's not bad."
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:16.960]   It just kind of made me think, even as I was preparing for this message, like how much
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:29.200]   of our time is spent in self-pity, in playing a victim, and not fixating our eyes upon Christ,
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:34.840]   and forgetting what it is that we have in Him, considering the severity and the kindness
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:39.040]   of God that has led us to repentance.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.720]   Ultimately, that's what the gospel is.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:48.040]   It humbles the proud and lifts up the humble, and the entrance into the kingdom is the same.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:53.120]   Jews, Gentile, rich, poor, educated, uneducated.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:58.040]   Christ has brought us so that we can all call Him our Abba Father, and in the end, that's
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:01.480]   what true worship is, isn't it?
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:07.600]   When we recognize who we were before we met Him, and every Sunday we come, we're reminded
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:10.840]   what it is that we have.
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.040]   You and I, including myself, we're prone to wander.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:16.240]   There's so many distractions.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:20.280]   But in the end, didn't we believe in Jesus?
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:25.880]   Didn't we confess our faith because we were enamored with Christ, and Christ was enough?
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:33.320]   If for whatever the reason, Christ hasn't become enough, that's the problem.
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:36.800]   That's where we need to take a step back and make Christ first.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.800]   Let's take some time to pray.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:42.000]   Well, actually, before we do that, I have a song that I wanted you to introduce to you.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.880]   I don't know if at some point we might sing this, but this is a song that was popular
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.160]   back in the '80s and '90s.
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:52.120]   So some of you who were born at that time may know this song.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.120]   Okay?
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.640]   So if you can put that up.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:58.000]   I'm just going to read it, and then we're just going to play the song.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.240]   So I want you guys to just listen to the songs.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.240]   Some of you guys just may be nostalgic.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:07.240]   You know what I'm talking about.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:10.040]   I'm just kidding.
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:13.880]   I want to introduce this song to you because the lyrics are related to the passage that
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:14.880]   I just read.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:19.600]   "Waiting for angry words to sear my soul, knowing I don't deserve another chance.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:25.600]   Suddenly, the kindest words I've ever heard come flooding from God's heart.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:29.520]   It's your kindness that leads us to repentance, O Lord, knowing that you love us no matter
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:33.240]   what we do, makes us want to love you too.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:37.440]   No excuse, no one to blame, nowhere to hide.
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:41.200]   The eyes of God have found my failures, found my pain.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:47.200]   He understands my weaknesses and knows my shame, but his heart never leaves me.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:51.680]   It's your kindness that leads us to repentance, O Lord, knowing that you love us no matter
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:54.640]   what we do, makes us want to love you too."
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:58.960]   So I'm going to ask you guys to take some time to listen to the song and meditate upon
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:01.800]   that, and then after that, our worship team will come up and lead us in time of worship
