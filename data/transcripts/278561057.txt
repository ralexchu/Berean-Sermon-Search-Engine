[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.080]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 15 verses 8 through 13.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.960]   Romans chapter 15 verses 8 through 13.
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.960]   Reading out of the ESV.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.240]   "For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.200]   in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs and in order that the Gentiles
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.920]   might glorify God for his mercy.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.420]   As it is written, 'Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles and sing to your name.'
[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.560]   And again it is said, 'Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people.'
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.960]   And again, 'Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let the peoples extol him.'
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.880]   And again Isaiah says, 'The root of Jesse will come, even he who arises to rule the
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.880]   Gentiles.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.240]   In him will the Gentiles hope.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.000]   May the God of hope fill you with all joy, peace, and believing, so that by the power
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.160]   of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.'"
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.080]   Let's pray.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.680]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you for the privilege that we have to be able to come
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.840]   and worship you.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.480]   We pray that your word, Lord God, would be your words, not mine, not from human experience,
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.440]   not human thought.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.720]   That your children will truly be able to hear your voice, that we may glorify and honor
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.500]   and follow you.
[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.040]   We pray that you would anoint this time, Father God, that it would go forth and not return
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.480]   until it has accomplished its purpose.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.720]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.000]   The text that we're looking at this morning, obviously all of it is important, but especially
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.920]   this text here in verse 8 through 13, it's a conclusion of the argument that he's been
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.720]   making in the Book of Romans.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.280]   Specifically in the context, he's been making the argument that in light of all the mercies
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.720]   that was taught from chapter 1 through 11, he says, "In view of this mercy," chapter
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.240]   12, "through where we are today, how we ought to live.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.080]   What should be the life of a believer who confesses to believe in justification by faith,
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.080]   that we've been saved by this grace of God, that we are truly affected by the gospel?"
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.360]   If you've been paying attention in the last maybe about 10 to 12 years, there's been a
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.200]   movement called the gospel-centered movement.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.360]   And if you went to any kind of Christian bookstore, you've probably seen gospel-centered parenting,
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.560]   gospel-centered evangelism, gospel-centered church planting, gospel-centered marriage.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.120]   And so this gospel-centricity has permeated every part of our Christian lives.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.120]   It's taught in seminaries, it's in conferences, it's in books that we read.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.080]   Sermons have been adjusted for that purpose.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.480]   And all of these things are great because the gospel is truly the foundation upon which
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.360]   we stand.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.600]   And anytime we stray from that, it becomes something else, where Christ is not central.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.880]   And we can easily become a gathering of people with good morals, doing good things, but then
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.840]   we forget why we're gathered together ultimately to honor and glorify Christ.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.860]   But if we're not careful, gospel-centrality can easily just become vocabulary in the way
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.100]   we say things, how we articulate something, and the way we think.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.700]   But Paul's been teaching, starting from chapter 12 all the way to where we are today, what
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.460]   gospel-centrality means.
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.440]   And the most tangible way that gospel, being gospel-centric, the way it should be applied
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.060]   is in the way that we worship God, in the way that we serve one another.
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.340]   And so specifically, he's been talking about how to handle a strong brother with a weak
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.940]   brother, in particular, these particular things that he's been talking about, eating and drinking.
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.940]   How do we handle that?
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.540]   How do we show grace, especially when we are right?
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.780]   So being gospel-centric is not having the right vocabulary and sermons sounding a certain
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.540]   way, and all of these things may be important, but the real application of that, where the
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.620]   rubber meets the road, is the way that we interact with one another.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.580]   You can be gospel-centric in your speech and have nothing to do with the gospel in the
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.980]   way that we deal with conflict, with people that annoy us, or when we think that we're
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:12.980]   right.
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.140]   Because ultimately, what we worship and why we're gathered together is because Christ
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.540]   saw our sins, and instead of turning away, he approached us and he saved us and covered
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.380]   us by his own righteousness.
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.620]   That's what we believe.
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.540]   That's every song that we sing, at the core of it, that's the message that we sing.
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.300]   But today's text isn't simply a conclusion of that that he's been saying for the last
[00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.300]   three chapters.
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.780]   It's actually a conclusion of the larger text.
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.980]   Remember in the beginning of Romans, Paul is introducing the gospel, and do you remember
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.380]   how he introduced the gospel?
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.420]   I was looking to see how many sermons that I gave on the book of Romans, and we're kind
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.060]   of at the tail end now, and I counted almost 120 sermons on the book of Romans.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.620]   And I started preaching the book of Romans in June of 2015.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.900]   So it's been a little over three years.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.740]   I think it's going to take us maybe to the end of this year to finish the book of Romans.
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.980]   So in all of these things that we've been talking about, even though there might be
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.860]   specific nuances that may have been different, but the central message has been the same,
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.420]   the salvation of the Jews and the Gentiles.
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.860]   So he started the book of Romans by saying, what, all have sinned and fall short of the
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.460]   glory of God.
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.260]   That those who are under the law will be judged under the law.
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.160]   Those who do not have the law will be judged without the law.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.980]   And in chapter three, he summarizes this by saying all have sinned, all, Jews and Gentiles,
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.780]   have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.820]   We are all under the judgment of God.
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.000]   The text that we're looking at today is a conclusion of that argument.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.400]   So when I first started to prepare for the sermon, starting from maybe even last week,
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.280]   my intention was to go through the exposition of chapter eight, verse eight through 13.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.840]   But this is because it is the conclusion of the argument.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.840]   And then the middle, starting from chapter 15, 14 to the end of chapter 16, he's kind
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.360]   of concluding his remarks.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.840]   Like, this is the reason why I'm coming.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.680]   I want to go to Spain.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.680]   I need some of your support.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.000]   And so he's making concluding remarks.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.960]   But the conclusion of what he's been saying from chapter one to all the way to chapter
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.560]   15 is stated in the few verses that are here.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.840]   So it was a three-part message or three-point message, but I divided it into two parts because
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.640]   I think we need to slow down and kind of really dissect what he is saying.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.360]   So I'm giving you a heads up that today's message is going to be a bit more heavier
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.360]   than normal.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.600]   So if you came in kind of half asleep, wake yourself up.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.280]   You know, I'm giving you a warning ahead of time because we're going to be diving into
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.360]   the nuances and the difference.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.360]   And so basically, Paul is going to be giving a broad redemptive outline of the Old Testament.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.360]   Okay?
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.320]   So that in and of itself, you can already see how that's going to be a bit heavy.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.660]   So I want you guys to prepare for that.
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:15.880]   In fact, not only is this a conclusion of 15 chapters of this argument of how all have
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.800]   sin and fall short of the glory of God, Jews and Gentiles, and then the concluding remark
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.680]   is all are saved by the grace of God, Jews and Gentiles.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.960]   So between chapter one and chapter 15, he's been giving the solution.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.160]   He gave the problem, and then he's been giving the solution, and then he gives a conclusion,
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.200]   which is where we are today.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.000]   So what I'm going to do today is I'm going to give you one point, and under that one
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.320]   point, there's four sub-points.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.300]   And then we're going to get to point two and three next week.
[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:53.280]   So the beginning point, the beginning of his conclusion is stated in starting, I'm going
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.200]   to start reading from verse seven all the way to verse nine.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.360]   He says, "Therefore, welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you for the glory of God."
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.960]   Again, and that is the conclusion of chapter 12 to 15.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.920]   And then starting from verse eight, he concludes the larger argument that he's been making,
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:15.360]   "For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God's faithfulness,
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.560]   in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs, and in order that the Gentiles
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.160]   might glorify God for his mercy."
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:28.240]   For the sake of paying attention and to make it easier for you to follow along, the first
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:36.440]   point that I want to emphasize is Christ's sacrifice proves that God keeps his promises.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.760]   Christ's sacrifice proves that God keeps his promises.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:46.360]   Some of you guys may remember a long time ago, a long time ago, it seems like a long
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.840]   time ago, in 1991, there was a movement called the Promise Keepers.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.840]   Anybody remember that?
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.840]   Okay.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.840]   Wow, really?
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:59.520]   Okay, so there was a movement called the Promise Keepers, and it was a bunch of men who started
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:05.640]   this revival among men, and just like the name says, they would gather all the men together,
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.640]   Christian men together, for the purpose of renewing our vows to our wives, renewing our
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.040]   commitment to our families, and thus, Promise Keepers.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.280]   Let's keep the promise that we made when we got married, right?
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.960]   Be godly Christian men.
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.840]   And so there was a huge movement at one point, over 800,000 people have attended this Promise
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.840]   Keepers.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.840]   And the reason why this was so successful is because generally we're not good at keeping
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.720]   promises.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:39.720]   The reason why Promise Keepers as a movement took shape and was so popular is because majority,
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:46.280]   if not every single person, has a testimony of failing in our promises.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.080]   There's a reason why Jesus says in Matthew 5, 33 to 37, he says, "Again, you have heard
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.680]   that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.200]   Lord what you have sworn.'
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:03.000]   But I say to you, do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.600]   God, or by earth, for it is a footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.600]   king.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:14.280]   And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.760]   Let what you say be simply yes or no.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.480]   Anything more than that comes from evil."
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.720]   In fact, Jesus himself said, "Don't take any vows."
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.880]   I know some of you guys are already asking that question, then, you know, everyone who's
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:33.200]   married here has taken some kind of a vow that you violated God's command.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.360]   Well, I'm not going to deal with that today, okay?
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.000]   So I'm just going to let you wrestle with that, and we'll come another time to deal
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.680]   with that, okay?
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:47.200]   But the text, Jesus clearly says, "Do not take oaths."
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.400]   And the reason why is not simply because of the people who are there.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.520]   Think of it from God's perspective.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:11:00.880]   For thousands of years, God's been dealing with his people, and the history of Israel
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.560]   is a history of God's faithfulness and the unfaithfulness of his people.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.120]   That's basically, in a nutshell, the Old Testament.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.600]   Repeatedly over and over again, you see in the book of Judges, where everyone did what
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.520]   they thought was right in their own eyes, and then they would get into trouble because
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:24.420]   they would forget God, and the enemies would come and get attacked, and then God raises
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:30.640]   up a judge, and then a revival breaks out, and then sometimes, not even months, days
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.040]   after revival breaks out, they completely forget about God, and they go right back into
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.560]   their idolatry, and then this cycle over and over again in the book of Judges.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:44.200]   But every time revival breaks out, they're like, "We will not do this again," and then
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.600]   they fall right back in.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.600]   Remember the book of Joshua, when Joshua, he stands before the nation of Israel at the
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:57.000]   end of his life, and he's tired of the people who are holding on to both the world and God,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.080]   and he said, "Choose you this day whom you're going to serve," and as he is finishing up
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:08.560]   his life, I mean, you could see the frustration in his tone, in his writing in Joshua 24.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.960]   Just choose.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.800]   Stop teeter-tottering between these two opinions.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.960]   If it is God you want to serve, serve him.
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.000]   If it is Baal you want to serve, serve him, but stop holding on to both.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.840]   But he says, "For me and my household, we will serve the Lord," and as a result of that
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:32.760]   powerful message, the nation of Israel responds in Joshua 24, 16, he says, "Then the people
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:39.560]   answered, 'Far be it from us that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.680]   For it is the Lord our God who brought us and our fathers up from the land of Egypt,
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:49.160]   out of the house of slavery, and who did those great signs in our sight and preserved us
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.080]   in all the way that we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.440]   And the Lord drove out before us all the peoples, the Amorites, who lived in the land.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.640]   Therefore we also will serve the Lord, for he is our God."
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.800]   So at the end of Joshua's life, he gives this great sermon, and a revival breaks out, and
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.720]   the nation of Israel says, "We will serve the Lord," and in their repentance, they recount
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:19.080]   his faithfulness to the nation of Israel, from delivering them from Egypt, from crossing
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:24.680]   the Red Sea, from his faithfulness and feeding them and caring for them, all throughout the
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.360]   desert and then entering into the Promised Land.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:33.600]   And yet, after this revival breaks out, after this promise, a vow that they take before
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:40.680]   God, it doesn't take long after Joshua dies, they fall right back into idolatry.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:47.720]   And Israel's history is a cycle of promises broken, vows given and then broken over and
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.600]   over again.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.720]   So think of it from Jesus' perspective.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.440]   He's been dealing with his people for thousands of years, and every single promise that they
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.900]   made, they broke.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:04.160]   So he's not simply talking about the people who are standing before him.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.480]   He's saying, "You do not have the power to keep your vow.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.400]   So stop making promises that you can't keep.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.400]   Stop saying that I will do this and I will do that.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:22.800]   You do not have the ability to do that."
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:30.400]   See the only person, only being in the universe who can make a promise and actually keep it,
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.800]   not just the next day, not just a hundred years later, but even thousands of years later,
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.400]   is God and God alone.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:47.000]   So he says all of this has been fulfilled to show you and to the world that God is faithful,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.860]   that what he says, he does.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.860]   Think about our lives.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.280]   Think about even the friendships that we have.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:01.720]   You know, the people that you were closest to the 10 years ago, that you say you're going
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.760]   to live and die with these people.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.600]   Are they all your friends today?
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:13.160]   Think about how easily our hearts can change.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.360]   We don't have any control over tomorrow, whether it is our work, whether it is our family,
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.720]   even with our own children.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:24.840]   We may desire it, but we don't have the ability.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.880]   And even our desire will change from time to time.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.120]   Our salvation wasn't based upon our will.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.880]   It wasn't based upon our discipline.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.960]   It wasn't based upon our determination.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.320]   It wasn't based upon our skill.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.880]   It wasn't anything that you and I stirred up because it is unreliable.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:50.400]   Anything that is dependent upon us is unreliable.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:58.720]   And so he says all this happened to reveal that God is faithful, that God is consistent.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.600]   What he promises, he does.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.300]   And the only reason why you and I are here is because that's who he is.
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:15.160]   The book all throughout Old Testament history is simply a record of the fulfillment of God's
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.160]   promise.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.580]   In Genesis chapter 3, as soon as Adam and Eve falls, he makes a prophecy.
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:24.200]   He promises the world that the seed of the woman is going to come.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.800]   He's going to crush the head of the serpent, talking about Christ.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:35.200]   And so the record of Genesis to the book of Malachi, all of Old Testament, is a record
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.600]   of God fulfilling that promise.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.680]   There's a reason why there's so many genealogies in the Old Testament.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.520]   It's not so that you can go to sleep.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:49.520]   You know, you've worked hard reading the Bible, so here's some genealogy for you to read,
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.120]   just kind of calm you down, right?
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:57.800]   Genealogies are there as a record of the seed of this woman coming.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:03.640]   And that's why, again, the book of Matthew starts with genealogy, to point that Christ
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.360]   is a fulfillment of that promise.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:12.640]   So everything that we read in the book of Genesis all the way to Malachi is God's faithfulness.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:17.560]   So Paul is going to make this argument, but he's not just going to say God's promise,
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.920]   he's faithful, he's going to show it to us.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:25.760]   He's going to recite the Old Testament, and he's going to recite a broad view of the Old
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.480]   Testament, just basically the redemptive history recorded in the Scripture.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:35.120]   And obviously, Paul could have quoted thousands of verses, but he picks four particular verses,
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.120]   and there's a reason why.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.520]   So if you can put up the next...
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:43.960]   So if you look at it, Paul is going to say God is faithful, and he does what he does
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.320]   to show the world that he can be trusted.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:52.560]   And then he quotes four particular passages, and the four verses come from one section
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:59.120]   from the Torah, which is the law, two of them from the Psalms, and one from the prophets,
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.920]   which basically is the summary of the Old Testament.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:07.160]   So he's basically saying this prophecy was not limited to just this one section.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:12.640]   All over the Old Testament, God has embedded what he was planning to do, and what you're
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.800]   seeing now is just the fulfillment of that promise.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:20.760]   That's basically, in a nutshell, an overview of what he's saying here.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:25.000]   So like I said, it's going to be a little bit heavier than normal, because I don't have
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.800]   any stories today, because I need the time to get into the text.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.800]   I may have a story.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.380]   I may have forgotten.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.480]   But I need some time for you to kind of like wrestle and digest this, and I'm going to
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:43.960]   tell you ahead of time that you need to be actively listening to this.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:49.600]   And the reason why, again, I'm not saying that on some Sundays you shouldn't, but in
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:57.960]   particular today, because if you really understand what God's been doing in history, there's
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:03.200]   no way somebody who believes what he is reading here can walk away without a greater sense
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.440]   of confidence in everything that God is doing today.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.960]   So I don't want you to just have a superficial, "Oh yeah, God is speaking."
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.360]   Of course I know that.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.080]   It's one thing to say, "No, no, you can trust him.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.080]   He's faithful."
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.560]   It's another thing to have experienced that and have seen that.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.280]   You may have the same opinion, but the depth is different.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.880]   So I really want you to see what Paul is trying to say.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.880]   He's not just saying it.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.520]   He's going to show it to us.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:39.920]   So the first thing that he says in verse 9, he quotes Psalm 1849.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:45.120]   He says, "Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles and sing to your name."
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:50.640]   Now out of the four verses, I want you to look at, if you look at the first three verses,
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:55.200]   which is starting from verse 9, I told you you're going to have to stay with me.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.840]   "Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles and sing to your name," verse 10.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.920]   And again it is said, "Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people."
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:06.280]   And then verse 11, "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples extol
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.360]   him."
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:13.440]   Do you notice the slight difference between the three verses and where the Gentiles fit
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.440]   into that?
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.440]   You don't need to answer.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:21.360]   I just want you to think a little bit.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.920]   Do you notice the slight difference in the three verses where the Gentiles fit into what
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.440]   he is saying?
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.600]   The first one, "Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles."
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:42.240]   So where the Gentiles are further out and the Israelites are exalting God and they are
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.240]   observing.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:47.080]   He said they are going to observe God's glory.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.320]   In verse 10, "Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people."
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.920]   So the Gentiles now have seen his glory and they have come to him and they are rejoicing
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.920]   and praising God together.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.560]   If you go to verse 11, it says, "Praise the Lord," who?
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.880]   "All you Gentiles, and let all the peoples extol him."
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.400]   So now who is praising him?
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.640]   The Gentiles.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:13.160]   So it is Israelites praising, Gentiles observing, Gentiles and Israel together praising God,
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.560]   and then verse 11 is the Gentiles who are praising God.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:24.200]   And that, in a nutshell, up to this point, is redemptive history that he is outlining.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.720]   So the first verse in verse 9, it says, "Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles," quoted
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:35.640]   from Psalm 1849, where David is praising God for empowering Israel, the nation of Israel,
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.160]   to be successfully conquering their enemies.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.560]   And it is in that context he is praising him.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:50.080]   But he recognizes that God's faithfulness to the nation of Israel is causing the Gentiles,
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:56.520]   the nations, to observe that and praise God for it, which was always God's intent.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:01.440]   In Genesis chapter 12, 1-3, with the inception of the nation of Israel, he says, "Now the
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:07.160]   Lord said to Abram, 'Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.840]   the land that I will show you, and I will make you a great nation, and I will bless
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.500]   you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:19.540]   I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.360]   all the families of the earth shall be blessed.'"
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:28.320]   So from the very get-go, his intention was not simply the nation of Israel.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.320]   Israel was simply a conduit.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:36.240]   Israel was simply an avenue in which God's glory was going to go to the ends of the world.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.480]   So it was never simply about Israel.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.720]   And David recognizes this, that even in their greatest conquest of their enemies, he says,
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:49.060]   "All the Gentiles will praise you because of what you are doing with us."
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:53.680]   In Genesis 18, 18, "Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.120]   all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him."
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.340]   Genesis 22, 18, "And in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.920]   you have obeyed my voice."
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.840]   Genesis 26, 4, "I will multiply your offsprings, and at the stars of heaven, and will give
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.720]   to your offspring all these lands, and in your offspring all the nations of the earth
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.160]   shall be blessed."
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.500]   Genesis 28, 14, "Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:22.180]   abroad the west and to the east, and to the north and to the south, and in you and your
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:26.920]   offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:32.360]   So the record in the book of Genesis is God bringing the nation of Israel, and through
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:38.140]   them as they are being blessed, all the other nations are coming to glorify God.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:44.480]   So even though the history is about, is specific about the nation of Israel, it was never specifically
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.020]   just about Israel.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.340]   That was God's intent, always.
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:53.780]   And that's why Peter, when he speaks and gives his first sermon in Acts 3, 25, he says, "You
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:58.580]   are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant of God made with your father, saying to Abraham,
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:03.500]   and in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:09.180]   So even a new covenant, as they recite the Old Testament, they said that this was God's
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.180]   intent, always.
[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:18.420]   Now I want you to just, you know, I know it's going to start sounding like a lecture, which
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:22.860]   is what my intent is this morning, right?
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:28.100]   I really want you to understand the depth of what Paul is saying here.
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:34.780]   Because if you miss that, or if you just kind of grasp it superficially, you're going to
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:41.020]   say, "God is good, God is love, God is faithful, God keeps his promises," because that's what
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:45.340]   you've heard, and that's what you've read, and that's what you've memorized, and that's
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.580]   a theology that you're supposed to hold.
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:52.980]   There is a world of difference between someone who comes to recognize that in pursuit of
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:58.180]   God versus somebody who heard it and just regurgitated it, because that makes sense.
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:01.460]   So I want you to see it for yourself.
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:06.460]   This was always God's intent, and that's what he means when he quotes that verse in Psalm,
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:07.700]   in David's Psalm.
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.620]   He says this is what God was doing.
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:14.520]   Secondly, in verse 10, "Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people."
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:21.360]   And this is a direct quote from Deuteronomy 32, 43, where Moses, at the end of his life,
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.360]   he writes a song.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.720]   Moses has three songs, and this is the last song that he writes.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:32.900]   And in his song, he recites God's faithfulness to the nation of Israel in the desert.
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:39.160]   But even Moses, the greatest leader in Israel, at the end of his life, recognizes that it
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.960]   wasn't just about Israel.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:48.000]   He said all the Gentiles, all together with God's people, rejoice.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:55.920]   And so whenever God would touch them with his glory, it wasn't just Israel.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.440]   We saw that with Nebuchadnezzar, King Cyrus.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.260]   We saw that with Naaman.
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:04.600]   We saw that with the king of Assyria and all their people.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:11.160]   And when they recognize this tiny little nation that should have been squashed and disappeared
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:16.240]   many times over, not only in the Old Testament, but even in the New Testament, and they say,
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:24.080]   how can this tiny little group of people who are wandering in the desert possibly conquer
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:29.960]   nations that have been fortified, who are solidified in their battle?
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:35.120]   They're better prepared, have more money, and they have walls to protect them.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:40.200]   And yet this tiny little nation with a brand new young leader, Joshua, walks in and the
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.040]   walls just go crumbling down.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.240]   So even the pagans were watching that from a distance and say, there's something about
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.460]   your God.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:55.160]   And even kings, pagan kings, would watch this and give God the glory.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:27:00.240]   And so Moses, recognizing that, in his song says, because of what he is doing with the
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:06.300]   nation of Israel, all the Gentiles will join with him to praise his name.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:11.140]   So by the time we come to the New Testament, we have a group of people called the God-fearers.
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:16.000]   So some of your translation didn't translate it exactly that way, but I think the NASB
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.400]   has literally, it says just God-fearers.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:23.960]   God-fearers are people who are worshiping Yahweh who didn't convert to Judaism.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:32.280]   They somehow came into contact either with a Jew or the message of the Israelites, and
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.520]   they saw God's glory, and they began to worship him from a distance as well, and they were
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.700]   called God-fearers.
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:42.160]   The Gentiles would join Israel to praise his name.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.520]   And so you kind of see the progression.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.400]   God establishes Israel.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.940]   Gentiles watch from a distance.
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:52.800]   And then as God is glorified through Israel, they begin to come and worship him together.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.760]   And then thirdly, we get to verse 11.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:01.080]   Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the people extol him.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:06.640]   And this is coming directly out of Psalm chapter 117, verse 1.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.360]   The significance behind this particular Psalm, we don't know the context.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:15.080]   There's a lot of people who are taking guesses, but we don't have a concrete context of this
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.080]   verse.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:20.780]   But what we do know about this verse is that it is the shortest verse, shortest chapter
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:22.780]   in all of the Bible.
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:29.860]   Let me ask you, what is the shortest verse in the New Testament?
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:30.860]   Jesus wept.
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:35.540]   So some of you guys may know the context of that, John chapter 11, where Jesus is standing
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:41.860]   in front of Lazarus' tomb, and he is overwhelmed with compassion and says, "Jesus wept."
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:45.020]   Most of you probably, if you've been a Christian for any period of time, probably already have
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.080]   known that.
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:51.060]   Maybe not the context, but you probably knew Jesus wept was the smallest verse.
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:54.660]   Because it says, one of those Bible trivias.
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:59.380]   Because it is the shortest verse in the Bible, Jesus wept.
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:05.340]   But do you think that maybe in the synagogues, the rabbis may have asked his congregants
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:06.700]   the same question?
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:12.540]   Maybe he was given a lecture and he said, "What is the shortest chapter in the Bible?"
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:15.500]   Psalm 117.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:20.560]   So my guess is, just like many of you knew and heard Jesus wept was the shortest verse,
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.380]   this is a verse or this is a chapter that they probably knew well.
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.620]   Knew probably pretty well.
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:30.460]   If you've been a Jew for any period of time, this is probably one of those verses that
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:34.660]   was memorized and recited often because of its uniqueness.
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:39.140]   And in 117, 1 and 2, it says, "Praise the Lord, all nations.
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:44.380]   Extol him, all peoples, for great is his steadfast love toward us.
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.940]   And the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever.
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.060]   Praise the Lord."
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:54.100]   This short verse that probably every Jew knew, outside of Deuteronomy chapter 6, 6, the great
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:30:00.140]   Shema, this is probably one of those verses that they memorized because it was just easy.
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:07.660]   And the content is about how all the nations will come and praise him because of his faithfulness.
[00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.700]   That this was embedded into their culture, into their psyche.
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:18.740]   So it is amazing that when Christ came and the kingdom began to get open to the Gentiles,
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:21.620]   why they were so resistant.
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.340]   Because it was embedded.
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:28.740]   And that's why, you know, Luke chapter 15, when Jesus was hanging around with the sinners,
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.620]   the Pharisees, like, "How can you possibly do that?
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:32.620]   Why do you do that?"
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.340]   And then Jesus tells them three parables to return to tables and rebuke them.
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:39.980]   "How did you not know that this was your God?
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.860]   You're rebuking me for hanging around with them."
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.260]   And then he turns around and rebukes them.
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:49.420]   "How could you not join me in reaching out to them when God clearly is a God who pursues
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.780]   sinners?"
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:56.980]   This was so clearly stated in the Old Testament that Paul is giving redemptive history by
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:01.260]   reciting these verses that this is not just something that Paul is just kind of pulling
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.860]   out of his hat.
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:07.780]   That if you read the scriptures carefully, that this is what God was intending to do
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.860]   all along.
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:14.060]   And that's why Jesus says, "You search the scriptures thinking that you're going to find
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.500]   life, but in it, what?
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.540]   Is all about me."
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:21.180]   It was the fulfillment of prophecy that the seed of the woman is going to come crushed
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.540]   ahead of the serpent.
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:27.460]   And all that he is stating in these passages was for that purpose.
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:34.620]   In Romans 9, 25 to 26, Paul has already said, as indeed he says in Hosea, "Those who are
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:37.060]   not my people, I will call my people.
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:40.740]   And her who has not been loved, who has not been loved, I will call beloved.
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:44.800]   And in the very place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' there they
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.860]   will be called sons of the living God."
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:52.220]   And that's where you and I are today.
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:57.540]   At one point, God raised a nation of Israel, and because of them, all the Gentile world
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:05.300]   was in awe, because they clearly recognized that it wasn't their power, it wasn't their
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:09.880]   ability to conquer, it wasn't their expertise in warfare.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:15.540]   They recognized it was their God behind them that caused them to be a force to reckon with.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:19.820]   And then as a result of that, many of the Gentiles began to come to Christ, and then
[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:24.340]   when the time of Christ came, the Gentiles were prepared to come and join the nation
[00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.220]   of Israel.
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:30.460]   But here in Romans, Paul says, "They have experienced the hardening of the heart."
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:37.380]   Now we're in a period of Gentiles, a period where the church has taken center stage, and
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.260]   now we are the light of the world.
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:45.020]   And the same purpose that he had for the nation of Israel, now he's exalting the church, that
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:51.260]   through the church, that the world may know the manifold wisdom of Christ.
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:56.620]   All of this wasn't plan B. This is what God intended, this is what God promised, this
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:01.620]   is what God fulfilled, and the whole book of the Bible is a record of his faithfulness
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.460]   to his promise.
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:09.100]   But the fourth verse that we're going to be looking at is what really gives life to all
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.000]   of these things.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.260]   Verse 12, which is a direct quote from Isaiah 11, 10, "The root of Jesse will come, even
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:21.580]   he who arises to rule the Gentiles, in him will the Gentiles put their hope."
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:28.260]   In other words, it's a prophecy of the Messiah, that all of this, the first three verses,
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:34.180]   the redemptive history, all of this is going to happen through the seed of the woman.
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:35.860]   The Messiah that's going to come.
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:40.740]   In Isaiah 11, 1-2, it says, "There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:45.140]   a branch from his roots shall bear fruit, and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:49.380]   him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:52.780]   of knowledge and the fear of the Lord."
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:59.600]   The reason why this is happening and will continue to happen, despite the unfaithfulness
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:04.540]   of his people, is because of the root of Jesse.
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:12.220]   But I want you to notice here that he doesn't say the fruit of Jesse, but the root of Jesse.
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:17.900]   The fruit of Jesse basically would mean that the nation of Israel, Jesse, again, as another
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:23.540]   way of saying the nation of Israel, that somehow their work and then they maneuvered and some
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.580]   great things happened and the Messiah came from that.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.940]   And we know from Jesus' genealogy that that's not true.
[00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:33.680]   In fact, you look at Jesus' genealogy, you think, "How could the Messiah have come from
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.060]   this genealogy?"
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:40.760]   But you see, he doesn't say the fruit of Jesse, he says the root of Jesse.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:46.960]   If you've ever had a tree in your backyard, in your front yard, when you want to take
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.780]   it out, you don't just cut off the branches, right?
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:53.280]   Because if you cut off the branches and you cut off the tree, there's a possibility, maybe
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:57.160]   not tomorrow, maybe not next year, but at some point it'll grow back.
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.340]   But if you want that tree to completely die, what do you have to do?
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.360]   You have to dig up the roots.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:09.160]   Because the roots, if it is still in the ground, there's hope for life in that stump.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:15.000]   And so when he says the reason why God is able to fulfill all of this is not because
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.280]   Israel's faithfulness, is not because the church's faithfulness, but because the root
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:23.520]   of Jesse, the root is Christ.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.440]   Christ is not the fruit of the church.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:30.280]   Church is the fruit of Christ.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:37.080]   And the reason why you and I still exist today, think about the chaos some of you guys have
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.880]   come from.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:44.140]   And I mean, anybody who's been in church for more than 10 years have horror stories
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.660]   of what you've experienced.
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:51.520]   Maybe it was your fault, maybe it was other people's fault, but you have stories.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:54.020]   And it's not just you.
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:59.960]   If you look at church history, there's periods, chunks of periods in church history where
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.880]   the leaders of the church were killing people for reading their Bible.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:07.480]   I mean, we're not talking about one or two events.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.840]   There are chunks of history where they were deliberately preaching false doctrines, selling
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.520]   the gospel, selling salvation for money.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.300]   And I'm not just talking about one or two periods.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:21.760]   We're talking about this was church history.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:27.640]   You can't study church history without that somehow creeping in every other thing that
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.180]   you read.
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:31.340]   How did we get here?
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.520]   How did the church survive?
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:37.780]   Was it because of smart men, determined people?
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:43.740]   Because people who have PhDs in theology, somehow that God used them to preserve the
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.100]   church?
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:53.180]   The only answer we have is Jesus said, "I will build my church and the gates of Hades
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.120]   will not prevail against it."
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.740]   Because Jesus is the root of the church.
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:05.820]   Only reason why you and I are here is because of that fact.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.660]   Study the Old Testament, study Israel's history.
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:11.700]   See if Old Testament history doesn't sound a lot like the New Testament history of the
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.360]   church.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:18.580]   After reading Israel's history from Genesis to Malachi, your end feeling or end result
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:23.260]   is going to be, "How did Israel, why is Israel not destroyed?
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.240]   Why does he put up with these people?
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:29.460]   How did they get to that point?"
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:36.300]   Simply because, he says, "The root of Jesse was coming."
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.760]   You see why this is so important?
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:49.580]   You see how easily you and I, without making any effort, put our confidence in man, put
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:55.260]   our confidence in the promises of people, friendships that we have at church, maybe
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.760]   even in leadership, certain systems.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.540]   How we so easily twist our confidence in everything that we see.
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:08.540]   Well, we know clearly that Scripture says that, "Just shall walk by faith."
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:13.540]   That our strength is not in numbers, that our strength is not in our experience or background
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:17.300]   or even in our leadership.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:21.100]   Our strength is simply because God said it.
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:25.700]   And he is not man that he should lie, nor the son of man that he should repent.
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:30.060]   Has he not said it and will he not do it?
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.860]   Let me conclude with Romans 11, 11-15.
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:38.580]   It says, "So I ask, did they stumble, the Jews, stumble in order that they might fall
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.700]   by no means?
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:44.300]   Rather through their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:45.300]   jealous."
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:49.580]   Now, if their trespass means riches for the world and if their failure means riches for
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:54.780]   the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean?
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:59.300]   Now I am speaking to you Gentiles and as much then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.940]   magnify my ministry.
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.620]   In order that somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous and thus save some of them.
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:10.620]   And then finally verse 15, "For if their rejection means a reconciliation of the world, what
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:16.180]   will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?"
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.900]   Revival is coming.
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:25.260]   If the gospel was preserved all these years, despite the unfaithfulness of the church,
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:29.900]   imagine how often, how many promises that you and I have made.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:38.420]   After coming back from retreats, hearing this great sermon, coming back from revivals, conferences,
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:45.340]   short term missions, and every time we fail, we repent and we're resolved, I'm not going
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:48.020]   to do this anymore.
[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:50.220]   I'm going to be different.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:54.220]   Every new year resolution, I'm going to be a better Christian, I'm going to know my Bible,
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:58.220]   I'm going to evangelize, I'm going to do this, I'm going to be more gracious.
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:03.100]   And often times it doesn't take long, even on Sundays you'll hear a sermon and be convicted
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:06.540]   and on the way back home you forget.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:09.200]   That's us.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:15.660]   We're not here because we were better determined, we figured out a better way.
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:20.820]   Because the root of our salvation is Christ.
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:28.340]   If you believe that, why would you not build on this solid rock?
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:36.020]   When the storm comes, you don't want to be in a boat because the ground is unstable.
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:41.940]   When the storm comes, you want to get to the shore as quickly as possible because you don't
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:44.740]   know what the ground is going to look like, you don't know when the wave is coming, you
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:49.220]   don't know when the disaster is going to come and flip your boat over.
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:53.460]   That's why he says, "Build your house upon the rock."
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:57.940]   And that rock is Christ.
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:01.780]   Why are you so anxious?
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:06.100]   What are you chasing?
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:09.100]   What are you grieved over?
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.820]   What are you concerned about?
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:19.300]   I pray that the faithfulness of our God will ground you in him and in him alone.
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:30.020]   Let's take some time to pray as we ask our worship team to come.
[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:38.380]   I'm not going to ask you to do anything this morning other than praise God for who he is.
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:45.340]   Thank him that you're here and that you even understood any part of this message.
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:51.500]   It is by the kindness of God that he leads us to repentance.
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:55.980]   So if any part of God's word has softened your heart, convicted you, reminded you, strengthened
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:42:00.160]   you, rebuked you, it's because it's the kindness of God.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:04.020]   So let's fix our eyes upon Christ this morning, just thanking him and praising him for his
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.020]   goodness.
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:05.620]   Let's pray.
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:14.860]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
