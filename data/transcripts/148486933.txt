[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.520]   >> Heavenly Father, we wanna thank you for this evening.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.920]   And we thank you, Father God, for the opportunity for us to come and study.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.200]   We ask, Lord, that your living word would have its purpose,
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.920]   help us to be focused, energized, strengthened.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.720]   And that our state of mind, our hearts, and
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.280]   our lives may all of it, Lord God, be aligned with what you desire for us.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.400]   So we pray for your blessing this evening, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.360]   All right, so just kind of as a overview,
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.000]   we're focusing on chapter seven and eight today, chapter seven and eight.

[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.800]   Were the questions a little bit harder today?
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.400]   Yeah, probably, right?
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.200]   I made it so that it required a little bit more work than normal.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.600]   How many of your tables don't have this sheet?

[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.040]   How many have extra on your table?

[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.960]   There's a few extra on this table.

[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.320]   Esther, do you need more?

[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.600]   How many guys have extra?
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.000]   I know you guys have extra here too.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.280]   You need more?

[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.440]   Who has extra of today's?

[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.880]   David.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.680]   You have extra?
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.280]   How many extra?
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.560]   Esther, they have more here.

[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.400]   And there's more here.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.640]   Just take what you need, let the people come later, they can look for it.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:17.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.380]   All right.
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.640]   I hope you guys had an opportunity to read Second Kings chapter 16, not 15.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.680]   I hope you figured it out.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.120]   I hope you didn't read chapter 15 and then say, it's kind of hard.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.680]   [LAUGH]
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.240]   Or the answer's hidden.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.520]   [LAUGH]
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.240]   Because it was a mistake.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.080]   It was chapter 16, okay?
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.960]   [LAUGH]
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.480]   So what is the background of chapter 16?
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.760]   Basically, the story behind it is that the king of the Northern Kingdom,
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.360]   what's his name?
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.760]   What is the king of the Northern Kingdom?
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.320]   Well, that's the father.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.280]   Pekka, right?
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.600]   And then the king of Assyria?
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.220]   Huh?
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.640]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.480]   It's just for review.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.320]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.320]   Who's the king of Assyria that's coming in?
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.320]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.320]   That's the guy that they want to appoint in Judah.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.340]   Huh?
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.160]   >> Romalia?
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.240]   >> Romalia is the-
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.260]   Okay.
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.120]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.720]   I think it'd be better if you just read through it.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.640]   [LAUGH]
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.320]   Resin, resin, okay?
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.240]   Resin.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.960]   It's in verse one.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.200]   So basically, Pekka, the son of Romalia, Romalia?
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.120]   Yeah, Romalia, and the king of Assyria, they basically joined forces.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.640]   But basically what happened was, they wanted to join forces to attack Assyria,
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.600]   or to defend themselves against Assyria.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.400]   But what the southern kingdom does, instead of aligning themselves with
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:23.800]   Israel and, okay, give me a second, let me get this straight out of my own head.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.760]   Okay, okay, all right.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.240]   So the king of Syria and the king of the northern kingdom,
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.000]   they actually come and ask the king of the southern kingdom
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.680]   to join forces against Assyria, okay?
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.360]   So that's where it's at.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.560]   Not Syria and the northern kingdom came and
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.760]   asked the southern kingdom to join forces against Assyria.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.200]   All right, it's not confusing, right?
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.240]   [LAUGH]
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.800]   It's not that confusing, right?
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.080]   So, but Ahaz, the king of the southern kingdom,
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.400]   basically thinks that this is not a good alliance.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.400]   Instead of joining with them, who does he join forces with?
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.640]   With Assyria, right?
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.240]   And so because he joins forces with Assyria, the two kings get mad at
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.040]   the southern kingdom, and they join forces to come and attack them, right?
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.040]   You read this.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.520]   You're looking at me like I'm saying something you've never heard before, okay?
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.440]   So they come down to attack the southern kingdom, but
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.600]   the southern kingdom, remember, they have alliance with Assyria.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.480]   And so Assyria comes and actually protects them, and
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.640]   then basically defeats the other two kings.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.420]   Yes?
[00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.400]   Okay, why is this so important?
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.400]   Because everything we're talking about is about that event, okay?
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.680]   It's about that particular event where King Ahaz
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.880]   decides to trust in Assyria instead of God.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.440]   And so even though they experience temporary success,
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.160]   God basically is going to bring judgment upon them, right?
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.160]   For not trusting in God and trusting Assyria, he says, basically what he's
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.640]   saying is, you've experienced temporary relief from whatever suffering that you
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.040]   thought was going to come because Assyria got on your plan, but
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.920]   Assyria is actually going to turn on you, and they're going to come attack you, okay?
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.240]   And so that is the historical backdrop behind what's happening, okay?
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.960]   So chapter seven through chapter 12, basically is kind of one theme,
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.800]   and that theme is, what happens to a nation that doesn't believe in God,
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.240]   that turns against God?
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.760]   Was Ahaz a good king or a bad king?
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.360]   He's a bad king, right?
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.280]   So he's mentioned four kings, right?
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.040]   We have, what's the first king?
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:04.760]   Uzziah, right?
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.480]   King Uzziah, who's the second king?
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.400]   Jotham, and then third king?
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.880]   Ahaz, which is this king, and then the fourth king?
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.480]   Hezekiah, okay, so we're not there with Hezekiah yet, okay?
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.440]   So out of the four kings that, the period that Isaiah prophesied,
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.800]   and out of the four kings, who was good and who was bad?
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:34.000]   Ahaz was the bad one.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.680]   Uzziah, was he a good king?
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.200]   Yes, but?
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.720]   Okay, he didn't remove the high places, basically it was idolatry, right?
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.160]   And then Jotham, the same, right?
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.320]   And then Ahaz was bad from the beginning to the end,
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.760]   and then Hezekiah was actually a good king.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.480]   So what's happening here is, Dorian, who's right?
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.160]   Who's right here?
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.160]   Ahaz.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:04.600]   So it was during a period when Israel was actually just completely under Ahaz's reign,
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.600]   they were doing evil.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.880]   So remember we talked about that last week?
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:14.680]   Last week, the prophecies are against during a period when Uzziah was reigning, right?
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.080]   So judgment is coming upon Uzziah and his kingdom, although Uzziah was a good king for
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.320]   the most part, but he didn't get rid of all of the idols.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.080]   So he says, because he didn't completely obey, the judgment of God is coming.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.720]   Now we come to Ahaz, right?
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:36.280]   God talks about judgment, but He also talks about, what else does He talk about?
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.280]   Redemption.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.120]   There's a lot of talk about redemption, right?
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.760]   In fact, at the beginning of it, He's actually pleading with Israel to come and do this,
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.100]   and to test me, and to know me, right?
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:54.720]   So the theme of this passage, or at least I titled it, The Good and Bad of Emmanuel,
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.720]   right?
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.240]   There's a dual nature of Emmanuel that we're going to see.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:04.840]   The famous passage in Isaiah chapter 7, 14, when the virgin shall have a child through
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.840]   a virgin.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:11.840]   And so the theme of this text in chapter 7 and on, but in particular the first two chapters,
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.680]   chapter 7 and 8, is about the presence of God.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:22.180]   Typically, when we think of the presence of God, depending on who you are, if you are
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:28.100]   somebody who's expecting judgment, when God comes, it means judgment, right?
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.780]   If you're somebody who's waiting for redemption, if God comes, it means redemption.
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.820]   So you see both sides of it.
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.540]   He says that Emmanuel is going to come, but we're going to talk a little bit more about
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.300]   that when we get to that text.
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.220]   But when he says the prophecy that I will give you a sign, and the sign will be of the
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:49.900]   Emmanuel, the virgin birth, is that a promise of hope or is that a promise of devastation?
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:55.340]   It's both, and we're going to see that.
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.900]   There's dual nature of Emmanuel, right?
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.740]   So let's start looking at it, okay?
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.300]   Again I apologize if I put the wrong text up.
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.020]   I hope you read it.
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.460]   So today I'm going to go over it a little bit differently.
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.740]   Based on some of the conversations I had, a lot of you guys had questions about the
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.820]   questions that I asked you, that you kind of wanted me to answer some of these.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:22.060]   So today I outlined the study based upon the questions.
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.620]   So if you take previous week's questions that you have and just follow along the questions,
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:31.060]   that's how we're going to be covering it today, okay?
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.980]   So that's how it's organized if you look at it, if you haven't figured that out already,
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:35.980]   right?
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.100]   Why is God helping Ahaz considering how wicked he was?
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:46.500]   So if you look at chapter 7, verses 1 through 9, God sends Ahaz to, God sends Isaiah to
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:52.460]   Ahaz and basically he's encouraging him to trust him, right?
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.940]   Why is he helping him?
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:01.740]   He sends him the Naqtivey of Syria and Ephraim, and Ephraim is just another name for the northern
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.060]   kingdom because God will deliver him from their hands.
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.700]   These two kingdoms are like two smoldering stumps of firebrands.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.660]   In other words, you don't need to fear these kingdoms, right?
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:17.540]   They may be, you might be afraid of them right now, but in my eyes, all they are is a smoldering
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.100]   stump and firebrands.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.540]   In other words, they're already dead, right?
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.500]   The final blow just hasn't come yet, it's going to come, so there's nothing to fear,
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.580]   right?
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:33.660]   So basically God is sending Isaiah to encourage him that don't be afraid of these two things,
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.660]   right?
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:41.020]   These two kingdoms, they're not going to be able to ultimately harm you.
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.620]   God is faithful to his own people and his own promises.
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:48.860]   So even though Ahaz is a wicked king, God's faithfulness to the nation of Israel still
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.380]   stands, right?
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:55.400]   We talked about that even Sunday, about how God is faithful, because of the wickedness
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.540]   of the nation of Israel, has God forsaken the covenant that he made?
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.380]   He said, "By no means," right?
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.060]   And so here's another example of that.
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:07.540]   Here's King Ahaz, even though he was a wicked king, he still considered them his nation,
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.140]   and he's still faithful to them, right?
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:15.060]   So God is not pleading with Ahaz because Ahaz was a king who deserved it, he's trying to
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.180]   preserve his own kingdom, right?
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:23.860]   So Isaiah's son's name, there's three children's names that are mentioned, right?
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.500]   And this is the first one.
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:30.460]   His first son, Shir Jashu, which means a remnant, shall return.
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:38.900]   So remember we talked about that, how the theme in chapter 7 and 8 is about Emmanuel,
[00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:44.020]   and it is a promise of redemption, but it's also a promise of judgment, right?
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:51.100]   So that name, like it does in oftentimes, it reflects what God is doing, it reflects
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.180]   the spirit of that time.
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.660]   And so the first name is a remnant shall return.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:04.580]   But another way to interpret that is only a remnant shall return.
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:09.060]   So in one sense it's a promise of redemption, that despite the destruction, despite the
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.060]   fact that war is coming, you're going to lose, right?
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.940]   Paddy's going to remain, right?
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:18.260]   But another way to interpret that is because of your wickedness, because you didn't trust
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.780]   in God, only a remnant is going to come, right?
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:26.420]   So in one sense it is an encouragement, in another sense it is a warning of rebuke, right?
[00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:31.420]   And you'll see that dual nature all throughout these two chapters.
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:37.660]   Remember we talked about that last time, how judgment is coming, and how he says, remember
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:43.340]   the previous text, from before the terror of the Lord and from the splendor of His Majesty,
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.340]   right?
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:49.740]   When he rises terribly on the earth, so he talks about the splendor and terror in the
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.340]   same, and he repeats that over and over.
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:57.220]   So when God shows up, there's terror for some, and then there's splendor and glory to others.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.260]   But it's the same God, right?
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.460]   And so we see that dual nature all throughout the text.
[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:05.980]   Like God's judgment isn't that he comes and all of a sudden he does one to another, but
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:16.380]   just by his presence, some are terrified and some have hope.
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.380]   What does it mean to put the Lord to the test?
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.780]   And that was the second question.
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:28.340]   When God tells Ahaz, at the end in verse 9 it says, "If you are not firm in faith, you
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.420]   will not be firm at all."
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.700]   And so the next verse it says, "Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz, 'Ask a sign of the Lord
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.980]   your God, let it be deep at Sheol or high as heaven.'"
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.620]   So God is telling him to test me.
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:54.460]   Why is God telling him to test him?
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:59.900]   Was it wrong to test God?
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:00.900]   Don't answer it, okay?
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:04.220]   I just want you to think about it.
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:08.540]   Where in the scripture do you find where it says about testing God?
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.580]   It's more than one place.
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.580]   What does he say?
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.580]   Right?
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:19.580]   So in Jesus' temptation it says, "Do not test the Lord."
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.580]   Right?
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.580]   Do you remember another place where it says about testing God?
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:33.100]   Do you want to read that for us?
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.100]   Or just do it in summary.
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:45.380]   "Do not put your Lord to the test at the waters of Nazareth."
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.380]   Any place else?
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.380]   "In the city of Jerusalem."
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:56.300]   Okay, so that was a form of a test.
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:02.540]   So if you look at the scripture you'll find there are places in I think Numbers, Deuteronomy,
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.460]   where it says not to test the Lord.
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:08.500]   And then if you go, you see an example of Gideon testing God.
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.340]   And then we see an example in Malachi where it says to give tithe.
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.580]   And then it says, "Test me to see if I will bless you."
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.580]   Right?
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:18.580]   So we see both.
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.100]   In one sense it says not to test the Lord, in the other sense it says to test me.
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.660]   So when it says not to test the Lord, what is the meaning behind that?
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:33.940]   Basically if you look at the text of Deuteronomy and Numbers, it's prohibition against unbelief.
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.540]   So testing doesn't mean to try God.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.200]   Testing basically means not to believe in Him.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:44.500]   So what we see in Gideon and Malachi when it says test me, what is he saying?
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.860]   Basically it means trust me.
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:53.300]   Put your trust in me and you will see that my promises will be true.
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.700]   So testing in itself was not evil.
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.780]   It's what's the purpose of the test.
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:03.540]   You know how even when we ask questions there's a difference, at least I've noticed, between
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:07.260]   asking questions versus questioning.
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.420]   Asking questions is a genuine desire to seek an answer.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:14.220]   Questioning is you've already made up your mind and I'm putting you to the test.
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.500]   There's a huge difference between the two.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:22.500]   So the testing that is prohibited is coming to God and saying, "Hey, you're not good.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.500]   Look at all of this."
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.500]   That's you're testing God.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:29.700]   Where you're coming to God and saying, "Well, can I put my trust in Him?
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.340]   Is this a being that I can put my full confidence?
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.900]   I believe, help my unbelief."
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:40.580]   So in Ahaz's situation when he says, "God says to test me, what is God doing?"
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.260]   Just like what he was doing in the first nine verses.
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:47.540]   He's basically telling Ahaz, "Don't put your confidence in Assyria.
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.060]   Don't be fearful of these two stumps that are coming."
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.220]   If you're going to fear anything, fear me.
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:58.900]   And so he says, so he's basically pleading with Ahaz and the nation of Israel, "Test
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:17:59.900]   me.
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.100]   Ask me and I'll show you that what I'm saying is true."
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.540]   And how does Ahaz respond?
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.220]   Again, we talked about this.
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:14.700]   Here's the passages if you're writing it down or it's already there.
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:20.460]   God's giving every opportunity for him to repent but he comes and he says, "No, I don't
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.460]   want to test the Lord."
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:26.460]   And so if you read it superficially, it almost sounds like Ahaz is like, "Oh, I can't do
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.100]   that to my God.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.700]   I can't test the Lord."
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:36.500]   It sounds like a man of faith but we know that that's not who he is.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.460]   The fact that he already made an alliance with Assyria against the will of God already
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.940]   tells us where this guy's heart is.
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.380]   So why does he say this?
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.380]   It's shown clearly.
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:19:01.180]   So if you look at the response of verse 13, if there was any doubt that his response was
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:08.620]   not in a response of honoring God but of unbelief, Isaiah responded and he said, "Hear then,
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:13.380]   O house of David, isn't too little for you to weary men that you weary my God?"
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:19.540]   In other words, his response to God was a statement of unbelief.
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:23.060]   It wasn't just, "Oh, how can I test my Lord?"
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.060]   Or "How can I test God?"
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.460]   It was kind of, "You can't see?
[00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.460]   You can't see?
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.460]   How about now?
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.460]   How about you?
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.460]   You guys are okay?
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.460]   Alright."
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:46.300]   I'm usually short enough where everybody can see me.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.220]   I'm too wide.
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.660]   Alright.
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:57.860]   So clearly his response was a statement of unbelief even though God is pleading with
[00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:58.860]   him.
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:07.180]   Again, it's not because Ahaz deserves it, it's because God loves his people.
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.460]   So what is the sign that he gives?
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.300]   He says, "Well, you're not going to ask for a sign, but I'm going to give you a sign."
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.620]   And this is where that promise of Emmanuel comes.
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.340]   And this is really interesting.
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.900]   I don't know if you've ever had a conversation with somebody who challenged you about the
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:21.900]   word virgin.
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:22.900]   Anybody?
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.900]   I mean, it's not a conversation that comes up casually.
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:29.060]   You know what I mean?
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:34.020]   I actually was out witnessing and one of the professors at UC Irvine actually brought that
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.020]   up to me.
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.700]   That word is not the word for virgin.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:44.900]   And so I actually had to go back and study it while I was in the seminary.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.340]   Despite Ahaz's unbelief, God is going to give him a sign.
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:53.260]   And that sign in verse 14 is the, again, prophecy about the virgin birth.
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:58.180]   But what's really interesting about this here is that the word used for virgin in this text
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:06.260]   is very significant because it has very specific prophecies that's going to be fulfilled immediately
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.260]   and later.
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.660]   Obviously, we know that this is a prophecy that was fulfilled in Christ.
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:17.420]   But this prophecy is also about what's going to happen immediately.
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.060]   So the word that is used for virgin here is a very ambiguous word.
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:27.500]   The Hebrew word is "ama," which can either be translated virgin or young woman.
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.500]   And this is the thing that I remember.
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:33.060]   I was out on campus witnessing and a professor came in and said, "You know the word ama doesn't
[00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.060]   mean virgin.
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.060]   It just means a girl."
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.060]   And I'm like, "Hmm."
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:42.060]   You know, I didn't take Hebrew yet, so I was just like, "No, you're wrong."
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.060]   I'm like, "Why?"
[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:49.380]   I'll tell you why later.
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.860]   So there was this whole premise and I went back to school and I asked my professor and
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:54.860]   he explained this to me.
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:22:01.540]   So basically what's going on here is Isaiah, or God, uses the word deliberately, the word
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.580]   ama, that can be translated either way.
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.140]   So the professor would say, "No, it is not."
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:07.820]   He said, "No, it can go either way."
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:13.620]   But clearly the prophecy that goes to Jesus is translated as virgin, right?
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.260]   Because Matthew uses it that way and it is not wrong to use it that way because it could
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.620]   mean both things.
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:25.620]   The plain word for the word virgin is dula, butula, in Hebrew.
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:27.620]   Yeah, that's about it.
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:34.620]   Anything more I say is going to butcher you.
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.620]   Butula.
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:39.620]   There's a vowel there and I don't know how that sounds.
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.620]   So you're just going to have to guess.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:43.620]   So the typical word.
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:49.620]   If the prophecy was specifically just to talk about virgin birth, the supernatural birth,
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:52.620]   that's the word that could have been used.
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:57.620]   The typical word that's used for a girl or a woman is isha.
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:58.620]   Isha.
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:04.620]   But the word that is used in the text is ama, that's kind of an ambiguous word that could
[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.620]   go either way.
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:11.620]   The reason why this is significant is the sign that he's talking about is an immediate
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:15.620]   sign with an ultimate fulfillment that's going to come in Christ.
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:20.620]   And so the immediate context obviously is not talking about a supernatural virgin birth.
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.620]   The immediate context is talking about, remember we talked about three children, right?
[00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:29.620]   The first one is the remnants will return or only the remnant will return.
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.620]   It has dual meaning, right?
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:39.620]   And then the second meaning is God with us and so the future application of that is the
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.620]   coming of Christ, that Christ is going to come and he's going to fulfill all the promises.
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:49.620]   But immediately God with us and what does God with us mean to them?
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:51.620]   Both.
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:57.620]   He goes back and forth from judgment to restoration, judgment to restoration, right?
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:00.620]   So there's dual meaning in the context.
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.620]   Like God is coming, right?
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:11.620]   Or God is going to be among us because God still loves his people.
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.620]   So it's clear the significance is that the immediate historical application of the birth
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.620]   of Emmanuel can be a woman, right?
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:25.620]   This could be Isaiah's second son and we have third son mentioned in the next chapter.
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:29.620]   Some people think that maybe this was Hezekiah, right?
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.620]   That's an educated guess.
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.620]   We don't know.
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:36.620]   But the prophecy basically is he's telling Ahaz, a nation of Israel, that before this
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:43.620]   child comes and before he turns 13, that these two nations that you're afraid of, so somewhere
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:48.620]   between 13 to 15 years from now, that these two nations that you're afraid of aren't even
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.620]   going to exist, right?
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:57.620]   And so you're going to Assyria asking for Assyria to help you but the real fear that
[00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:59.620]   you should have is not these two nations.
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.620]   It's Assyria.
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:05.620]   What you're relying on to save you isn't really going to save you.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.620]   They're going to actually come and destroy you, right?
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.620]   So that's basically what he's saying.
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:15.620]   And then he basically he's saying, one, you have the fear in the wrong place, right?
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.620]   Those two stumps.
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:22.620]   And then your confidence is also in the wrong place in Assyria, right?
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.620]   And then he says, I'm going to show you a sign.
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.620]   The sign is going to come when Jesus is going to come and all of these things are going
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.620]   to be nothing but then immediately his presence is going to stay with you.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:36.620]   So in other words, that your confidence should really rely on the presence of God, right?
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:42.620]   Anything else, any other confidence that you have is going to be misplaced and eventually
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:46.620]   is actually going to destroy you, right?
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:50.620]   I mean, think about the modern application of that, right?
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:55.620]   If you have confidence in your government, confidence in money, confidence in your ability,
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:26:03.620]   confidence in friendship, you know, one thing that I've learned, you know, and I, you know,
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:08.620]   just in the 40 some years that I've lived is that anything that you think is a good
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:14.620]   foundation for you, right, eventually God will test all of that.
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.620]   Every part of it.
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:20.620]   And that's why, I mean, you see old people who aren't walking with the Lord and why they're
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.620]   so, I'm not saying they're all like that, but there's so many bitter and angry people.
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.620]   You know?
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:30.620]   Because at the end of their life, everything that they've had confidence in has been yanked
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:31.620]   out.
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:32.620]   You know?
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.620]   So if everything that you had confidence in is yanked out and you can't trust it anymore
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.620]   and you don't believe in God, what are you left with?
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:45.620]   You just become bitter, you don't trust anybody and you become isolated, right?
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:49.620]   And so basically what God is saying is that the only place and only being that you can
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:53.620]   have confidence in that won't let you down is God, right?
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:58.620]   So again, this prophecy of the Emmanuel is very significant because he's not simply talking
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:03.620]   about Christ coming, but his presence is with us at all times, right?
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:07.620]   There's an immediate application.
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.620]   So the question is what will happen within the time frame?
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:15.620]   He said before this child turns 13 or the age of accountability that they understood
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.620]   that these two nations will be gone.
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:32.620]   So in the prophecy in chapter, we're in chapter 8, right?
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:41.620]   Oh, we're not in chapter, chapter 7, 18 through 25, right?
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.620]   What is the reference of the fly and the bees?
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:48.620]   The fly streams and the bees may be in reference to their number and their pesky nature.
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:51.620]   Who is that in reference to?
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.620]   The Assyrians, right?
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:59.620]   They're going to come in and they're going to come in huge number, right?
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:11.620]   In large numbers and torment them like flies and bees.
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:17.620]   If you look at verse 18, 20, 21 and 23, it gives you, it says, "In that day the Lord
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.620]   will," and he said, "Here comes a judgment."
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:25.620]   Because you didn't trust in God and you put your trust in man, here comes a judgment.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.620]   He said, "They will come and occupy the land in large numbers."
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.620]   18 and 19.
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:34.620]   Talking about the flies and the bees, right?
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:39.620]   "They will come and disgrace men by shaving off all of the hair on their bodies."
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:43.620]   So you may have read verse 20, kind of like, "Hmm, what does that mean?"
[00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:49.620]   They put razor, the higher, beyond the head, beyond the river with the king of Assyria,
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.620]   the head and the hair of the feet and it will sweep away the beard.
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:58.620]   The reason why they use that is because at that time shaving your head was a sign of disgrace.
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.620]   So if you got into a battle and you lost, one of the things that they may do is to shave
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:05.620]   your head and you'll come home disgraced, right?
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:09.620]   So that's what it means, that these guys are going to come and they're going to disgrace you.
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:19.620]   And the funny thing is, and I don't know if this is connected, years ago I shaved my head
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.620]   when I was a youth pastor at a Korean church.
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:28.620]   And I shaved my head thinking like, "Oh, I'm going to take a vow and I'm going to pray
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:29.620]   and I'm going to seek God out."
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:34.620]   And then one of the Korean elders came up to me and he said, "Did you cheat on your wife?"
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.620]   That's what he asked.
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:38.620]   I was like, "What? Where did that come from?"
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:43.620]   And so I asked him, "Why do you even ask that? I'm a youth pastor."
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:47.620]   And he said, "That's what Koreans do when they do something disgraceful.
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.620]   It's a sign of shame."
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.620]   So I was reading that and I said, "Oh, that's interesting.
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.620]   Maybe it's in all the Asian cultures."
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.620]   But that's basically what this means, is that the enemies are going to come
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.620]   and they're going to put them to shame.
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:09.620]   Verse 21 and 22, "In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:13.620]   and because of the abundance of the milk that they give, he will eat curds.
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:17.620]   For everyone who is left in the land will eat curds and honey."
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.620]   So at first it looks like, "Oh, why would that be a curse?
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.620]   They're going to be eating honey and curds."
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:28.620]   Basically what it means is that the land is going to become so desolate
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.620]   that you have these animals who are producing milk,
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.620]   and there's not enough people to even eat it.
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:37.620]   Typically, honey and curd was food of royalty.
[00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.620]   A common person would not be able to touch that.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:42.620]   But what it's saying is that the land is so desolate,
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:45.620]   there's not going to be enough people to eat it.
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.620]   That's what he's saying.
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.620]   So this wasn't God saying that, "Oh, here's a blessing for you."
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.620]   It's a sign that the judgment is going to be complete.
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:02.620]   The land that you are now is filled with vines worth thousands of dollars,
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.620]   and it will be filled with people coming with bow and arrows
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.620]   to claim the land for themselves.
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:09.620]   Because it's desolate, you're going to have all these people
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.620]   who are coming to claim it by force.
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.620]   As a result of that, you can't even go there.
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.620]   It's not going to be safe.
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:23.620]   So the picture that's drawn is, he said,
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.620]   "They're going to come and they're going to occupy your land,
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:29.620]   like fleas and bees.
[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.620]   They're going to come and conquer your nation.
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.620]   They're going to put you to shame.
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.620]   And then they're going to carry you off.
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.620]   And once they carry you off, the land is going to be desolate,
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:41.620]   and they've got all this food that you're going to be able to eat,
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:43.620]   but you can't even go to that land
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:46.620]   because all these people are coming to take it by force."
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:51.620]   And this is exactly what happens in Israel's history.
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:56.620]   His third child, Mahashalav,
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:01.620]   it means "spoils, speeds, or prey hastens."
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.620]   In other words, it's kind of at the end part of his prophecy
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.620]   about the judgment that's coming.
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.620]   Because they refused to trust in God,
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.620]   instead they put their trust in Assyria.
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.620]   And God comes and takes the land.
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.620]   And the people of Israel,
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.620]   they put their trust in Assyria.
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:23.620]   And God comes and pleads with them
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.620]   not to hold hands with Assyria.
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.620]   They don't listen.
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.620]   And as a result of that, the final judgment
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:33.620]   is that God's going to just kind of withdraw himself.
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.620]   Remember we talked about that last week,
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.620]   that God takes away the hedge, right?
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:41.620]   The kingdoms are already there about to pounce on them.
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:44.620]   The only reason why they're surviving is because God was protecting them.
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.620]   And so God basically is saying he's going to withdraw.
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.620]   And if he withdraws, then whatever happens to them
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.620]   is everything that happened to all the other nations
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:58.620]   is going to happen to them.
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.620]   So what does it mean to reject the waters of Shiloh
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:05.620]   and rejoice over Rezin and son of Ramalia?
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:09.620]   The gently flowing waters of Siloam.
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.620]   How do you say that in--how do you pronounce that?
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:15.620]   I don't even know how to do it in Korean.
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:23.620]   I don't know the Favre accent.
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:27.620]   That sounds like Korean.
[00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.620]   I forgot, my professor said it.
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:33.620]   It doesn't sound like the Greek.
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.620]   The reason why I remember it in Korean
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.620]   is because the Korean sounds much more like the Greek
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.620]   than the English does.
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.620]   English is--it butchers it.
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:43.620]   Anyway.
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:47.620]   I know, but I sing about this word in the New Testament.
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:49.620]   I'm just going to say it in Korean.
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:54.620]   Siloam.
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.620]   That probably sounds--it's probably closer to the real word.
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.620]   It represents the rain of Yahweh.
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:04.620]   In other words, you have this calm river where you can drink from,
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:07.620]   but then you've chosen to go with Assyria
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:10.620]   and compare Assyria to this raging water.
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.620]   And it may sound like it's going to--at that moment,
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.620]   it seems like it's going to do its job,
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.620]   but that you're basically playing with danger.
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.620]   And eventually, that thing's going to swell up,
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:21.620]   and it's going to swallow all of you.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.620]   And that's the imagery that he's giving.
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.620]   When you go after--so put your trust in things that are dangerous,
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:28.620]   that there may be immediates of affection,
[00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:34.620]   but long-term, there's more danger.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.620]   So he says, "Instead, Israel has chosen the wild waters of Assyria
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.620]   and rejoiced in the destruction of Rezend,
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.620]   and the son of Amalia waters will rise,
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.620]   and it will sweep them all away."
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:53.620]   [pause]
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.620]   So as a result, again, the end part of this,
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.620]   what does he tell Isaiah to do or not to do?
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:01.620]   Obviously, to not--to fear man,
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.620]   and you will find destruction and domination from them.
[00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:08.620]   Fear God, and you will find Him to be your sanctuary.
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:14.620]   [pause]
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.620]   Again, the dual nature of God's presence.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:19.620]   It is a sanctuary to those who fear Him,
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.620]   and it is a source of danger for those who deny Him.
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:27.620]   [pause]
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:31.620]   So obviously, for Christians, when we think about the Second Coming of Christ,
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:35.620]   we're thinking of salvation, glorification, right?
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:38.620]   But to the rest of the world, what does Second Coming mean?
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:42.620]   [pause]
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:44.620]   Time's up, right?
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.620]   It says in Peter's writings, and it says, "Why isn't He coming?"
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:49.620]   People are mocking the Christians.
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.620]   "How come He's not coming? How come He's not coming?"
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.620]   Remember what Jesus says? Remember what Peter says?
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.620]   [pause]
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.620]   Why hasn't He come?
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:00.620]   Why, after 2,000 years, has He not come?
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:03.620]   [pause]
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:05.620]   So how is He being merciful?
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:09.620]   [pause]
[00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:11.620]   To be saved, right?
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:13.620]   He's giving time for the Gospel to go out.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:17.620]   So if He came when people were begging Him to come,
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:20.620]   you and I would not be here, right?
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:23.620]   So we're part of the reason why He didn't come in 2,000 years.
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:28.620]   Maybe there's more people that God has in store for them to come,
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.620]   and that's why He's not here.
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.620]   The only reason why He has not come yet is because He's giving opportunity
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:38.620]   for all the elect that He has appointed to come into His kingdom, right?
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:44.620]   But once that time is done and He comes, it means time's up, right?
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.620]   It means salvation for us, but it means judgment for everybody else.
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:51.620]   And there's more who will fall on the other side than those who are elect.
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:57.620]   So again, the dual nature of this whole thing where God is pleading with the nation of Israel to come, right?
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.620]   And so come because that's where salvation is.
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:03.620]   And if you put confidence in anything else, right?
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:08.620]   And that--remember the imagery that we see with Assyria?
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:14.620]   At that moment, what Isaiah was saying didn't make any sense
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:17.620]   because did Assyria help them or not?
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.620]   Yeah, Assyria helped them.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:23.620]   It was because of Assyria that those two kingdoms--at least from his standpoint--
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.620]   said, "What are you talking about?
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.620]   Assyria's going to come and destroy us.
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.620]   They're our friends.
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:31.620]   They're the ones who protected us.
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.620]   If it wasn't for them, we would have been wiped out a long time ago.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:37.620]   You're asking us to put our confidence in God that we don't see,
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:41.620]   and here's a superpower that's willing to protect us and befriend us,
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:43.620]   and you're saying that they're going to hurt us?"
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.620]   It's like, "I don't see it."
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:51.620]   So what God is saying here is going against what He sees and what He's experiencing.
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:53.620]   Eventually it happens.
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:57.620]   He says that in about 65 years, you're going to see all of this.
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:01.620]   Everything that I'm prophesying is going to happen, and it's exactly what happens.
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.620]   It's no different now.
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.620]   Everything that we see is like, "Well, trust in God.
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:09.620]   If I have money, I can pay bills."
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:16.620]   So we seek for things that are tangible, but faith--faith, just like here,
[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:20.620]   at the end of this first section,
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:24.620]   "If you are not firm in faith, you will not be firm at all."
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:28.620]   And that's the theme of what He's been trying to teach the nation of Israel.
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:33.620]   So if you walk by sight, who wouldn't choose this here?
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:36.620]   These guys are just good friends.
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:37.620]   These are superpowers.
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:41.620]   If you had money problems and Mark Zuckerberg wants to be your friend,
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.620]   why wouldn't you befriend him?
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:47.620]   And then you have some weird prophet saying, "Don't befriend Mark."
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:48.620]   You know what I mean?
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:53.620]   Facebook is going to destroy your privacy, and it's going to ruin your friends.
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.620]   You know what I mean?
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:39:00.620]   He said, "Instead of choosing the security and having faith in God,
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:03.620]   you chose to go after the raging waters."
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:04.620]   And it may seem fun.
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:09.620]   It may seem like there's more water in the raging water than a calm stream, right?
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:12.620]   But that raging water is going to come and consume you.
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:15.620]   And it's the same thing, the same thing that God says to the nation of Israel,
[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.620]   the same thing that He's saying to us.
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:23.620]   If you choose to walk by faith, in time you will see the fruit of that.
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:28.620]   If you choose to walk by sight and you go after whatever at that moment is going to answer your questions
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:36.620]   and pay your bills or whatever that may be, eventually the water is going to rise and it's going to consume you.
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:40.620]   He says to not deter, right?
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:49.620]   Isaiah tells the people in 8, 16, 19 not to turn to mediums or necromancers because God has hidden His face.
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:52.620]   In other words, don't turn to these things.
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:40:00.620]   Don't test God and say, "Well, God's not answering my prayers, so I'm not going to go somewhere else."
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:03.620]   God tells Isaiah to continue.
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:11.620]   Though Israel may be facing judgment, Isaiah vows to continue to teach the faithful and continue to hope in Him.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:16.620]   So not only is He encouraging the nation of Israel and warning them, remember,
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:21.620]   He calls Isaiah, "Who will go for me?" and then He says, "Go to these people.
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:24.620]   They're going to hear, but they're not going to repent.
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:26.620]   They're going to harden their heart.
[00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:30.620]   How long, Lord, until all of this takes place?"
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:35.620]   So God turns to Isaiah and says, verse 16, 8, 16,
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:39.620]   "Bind up the testimony seal of teaching among My disciples.
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:45.620]   I will wait for the Lord who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in Him."
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:50.620]   That even in the midst of all of this and all He sees is judgment and destruction and people are not turning to God,
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:56.620]   He says to focus your teaching on the faithful, on the disciples.
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:02.620]   And so that's a vow that Isaiah takes, that even though God has chosen to hide His face from the nations,
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:04.620]   I will continue to put my trust in Him.
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:08.620]   So Isaiah becomes an example of what He's telling the nation of Israel.
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:11.620]   Judgment's coming because of your poor choices.
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.620]   Because of your idolatry, judgment is coming.
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.620]   It's inevitable, right?
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:22.620]   But He's saying the faithful, the remnant, who chooses to stick with God, is going to see better days.
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:25.620]   And so that's the warning and that's the encouragement.
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:34.620]   So if you look at God's challenge to the nation of Israel, His presence, it's not, "Here's point one, two, three, four, five.
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.620]   Here are things that God's going to do, here are things that God's not going to do."
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:40.620]   But in the end, when He shows up, it happens.
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:44.620]   Revival isn't when God comes and He orchestrates certain things.
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:48.620]   Revival happens when God shows up.
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:54.620]   Just like Joe, when God shows up at the end of his life, God doesn't fix everything.
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.620]   He doesn't say, "Oh, He went through all this."
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.620]   He doesn't answer any of His questions.
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:02.620]   He doesn't say, "God did this because you did this and this is going to happen.
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.620]   And the reason why this happened is because I wanted you to show that."
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:05.620]   He doesn't say any of that.
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:07.620]   He just shows up.
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:14.620]   And then once Joe gets a glimpse of His glory, he says, "Now I can die."
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.620]   Right?
[00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:18.620]   God was the answer.
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:27.620]   And so the judgment is, if God's showing up as the answer, the opposite of that is judgment is when God withdraws.
[00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:33.620]   Because our life, God created us for the purpose of declaring and to shine His glory.
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:37.620]   So when God's presence is there, His glory is shining off of us.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:41.620]   So we automatically live because that's why God created us, to glorify God.
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:46.620]   So if God withdraws His presence, what happens to us?
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:49.620]   What's the purpose of existing?
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:50.620]   Right?
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.620]   It's like a computer with no electricity.
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:56.620]   It's just a box.
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.620]   And so that's kind of like what he's saying.
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:03.620]   His presence comes and His presence is the answer.
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.620]   And so he says to put your trust in Him.
[00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:09.620]   Not other things that you see, but in Him.
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:14.620]   All right, so I tried a little bit different so that I can kind of help you along with your questions.
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:17.620]   And hopefully that helps you answer some of the questions that you had.
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:25.620]   And again, I want to encourage you, as you guys spend some time with your small group, if you have any questions, raise your hand and I'll come and try to answer some.
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:30.620]   And then remember the sign-up thing up over here, because it's due on the 4th.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:31.620]   It was my fault.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:33.620]   Last week I was supposed to do it and I completely forgot.
[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.620]   So today is pretty much the last day.
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:39.620]   So please, if you're intending to sign up, do it today.
[00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:40.460]   Okay.
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:50.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
