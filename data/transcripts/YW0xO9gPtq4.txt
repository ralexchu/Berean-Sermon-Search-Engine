[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:25.160]   - Oh yeah, now this is what I'm talking about.

[00:05:41.680 --> 00:06:04.860]   - All right, good morning and happy New Year's,
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.680]   church family.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.780]   I hope you had a good week in the Lord.
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.360]   Whether you had a good or challenging 2024,
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.660]   we know our God is faithful
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.880]   and we trust that he is working in all things.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.380]   So with that, let's begin our service this morning
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.060]   with a song of worship to our God,
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.260]   who is worthy of praise.

[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:40.980]   - All right, good morning.
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.680]   Welcome to Bering Community Church.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.880]   Hope you guys had a restful week.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.780]   I know that this season at the end of the year
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.940]   and beginning of the year is always hectic.
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.180]   But as we face a new year,
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.980]   I mean, there's a lot of things going on.
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.080]   We wanna make sure that we prepare our hearts,
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.380]   that we don't just spend another year
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.480]   just kind of coasting along,
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.280]   but that we're intentional with everything that we're doing.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.580]   And so, as you can see, our banner back here,
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.580]   "Devote Yourself to Prayer,"
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.680]   that is our new theme that we are pursuing.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.380]   And I'll explain 'cause for the next couple times
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.180]   that I'm up here, I'm gonna be going over the text
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.080]   and how we're gonna be focused on this in the new year.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.380]   But a few announcements.
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.380]   First of all, Jubilee Fellowship Lunch.
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.680]   If you are over 50,
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.880]   the Jubilee Fellowship Lunch is happening next Sunday
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.680]   after the third service at 1 p.m. in the Youth Chapel.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.180]   The cost of lunch will be $10.
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.980]   And if you happen to have a child,
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.180]   most Jubilee members don't have children this young,
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:42.180]   but if you do, for 10 years and older, it'll be $5, okay?
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.680]   And today is the last day to sign up.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.280]   So if you go outside, there'll be a table there.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.680]   So go there and please sign up today.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.780]   Today is the last day you can sign up for that.
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:51.980]   Bring in membership class.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.980]   If you are applying to take the membership class,
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.380]   our next class is starting on January 26th at 9.30
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.880]   at the Youth Chapel, and this is an eight-week course.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.880]   Please sign up for that.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.280]   Again, it's starting on January 26th at 9.30 a.m.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.480]   Members meeting happening at the end of the month,
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.880]   January 26th.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.180]   Again, this is every beginning of the year.
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.180]   We go over, you know, the finances and various things.
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.980]   So it is a quarterly mandatory meeting.
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.180]   So if you can't make it, please let us know ahead of time.
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.980]   And along with that, our college department will be having a
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.580]   fundraiser lunch right before it.
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.380]   BAM Retreat, Run to Win.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.780]   It's happening at the end of the month, January 31st to the 2nd.
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.480]   This week is the last week to sign up.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.580]   So if you are applying to go and you haven't signed up,
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.280]   please sign up.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.680]   Last time they did this, they reached the maximum.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.680]   And so after a while, they weren't able to add more people.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.480]   So please sign up as soon as possible.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.380]   And this week is the last week to sign up if you are applying to go.
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.780]   And then lastly, there is a big change that's happening at church
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.480]   with the planning center.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.180]   If you are aware of it, it's the way that we're conducting all the
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.980]   logistics and various things.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.380]   And the way that it will most likely affect you is the -- first
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.880]   and foremost is the offering.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.080]   I know that we switched to Subsplash last year and found out
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.280]   that through various channels in our church that this center is
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.380]   actually much more effective and it's actually more cost effective.
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.180]   So remember, you had to pay a 2% or 2.3% or something like that if
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.580]   you paid with credit card or through the bank.
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.380]   This center is a little bit cheaper.
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:33.080]   If you're going directly from the bank, it's actually only 30 cents
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.080]   instead of a percentage.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.180]   So it's going to be much cheaper and it's much easier to keep track.
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.780]   So we have a short video that we want you to watch.
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.880]   Those of you who learn better visually, like I do, there's a
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.780]   short video that was made by our media team.
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.280]   So if you can watch that, and then afterwards I'll pray.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.180]   And then it's starting today, right?
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:50.980]   Yeah, starting today.
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.180]   So we're going to give you maybe a little bit longer for offering
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.280]   time because they're going to have to figure this out.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.080]   And then if you can't figure out today and you need help like I do,
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.480]   there is a table outside that you can go.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:08.180]   So if you're part of the Jubilee ministry and you need a step-by-step
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.880]   guide like I do, you can go visit that table after service and
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.780]   they'll give you the instructions that you need to help you set it
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.580]   up on your app, I think.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.080]   Okay?
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.280]   Let's watch the video.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:23.980]   Here's how to set up a new payment method on the BCC app.
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.180]   Click give on the bottom right-hand corner and then click on the
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.780]   three lines in the top right-hand corner.
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.480]   Select login.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.680]   This will prompt you to enter in your phone number.

[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.380]   So as soon as you put in, I think your phone number, right?
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.780]   Put in your phone number, your information will pop up.
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.280]   If you're not a member, it's not listed.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.680]   You're going to have to manually put those things in.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.180]   Okay, so let me pray for the offering and then we'll give you a
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.880]   little bit extra time to do this on your app.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.580]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much for your continued grace.
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:51.280]   Help us, Lord God, to see how desperately we are in need of you
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:51.880]   every day.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.080]   That our worship to you
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.480]   would be a necessity in our life.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.880]   It would be an overflow of joy.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.180]   Help us to seek you with all our hearts and not just casually
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:05.980]   attend worship.
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:11.080]   We pray that even in this giving, this new year, Lord God, help
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.980]   us to be intentional with all parts of our lives and we ask
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:19.080]   Lord that you would help us that even with our finances that we
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.780]   would glorify you this morning and may it be multiplied for the
[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.680]   sake of your kingdom.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.580]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.

[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:23.840]   Father, we seek your wisdom.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.840]   We seek your guidance.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.840]   We seek your spirit, Lord God, to lead us,
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.840]   to soften our hearts,
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.840]   to open our ears,
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.840]   and a willingness, Lord God, to obey.
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.840]   I pray, Father God, that your word
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.840]   and only your word would go forth from here.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.840]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:46.840]   As you guys know, every year,
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.840]   as we have our meetings and our leadership,
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.840]   and we kind of evaluate where we are as a church,
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.840]   and we focus on areas of the church
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.840]   that we need to strengthen.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.840]   It says in Hebrews chapter 12, 12,
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.840]   "Considering the cloud of witnesses
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.840]   "that have gone before us,"
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:05.840]   and 11 chapters of teaching us about who Christ is
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.840]   and what he means to us, he says,
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.840]   "Strengthen what is weak.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.840]   "Strengthen the hands that are weak
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.840]   "and the knees that are feeble,
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.840]   "and make straight paths for your feet."
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.840]   And so every year we evaluate where are we as a church,
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.840]   where we need to go, and as you guys already know,
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.840]   you're probably asking, again,
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:27.840]   we're going to be focused on prayer again, right?
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.840]   This is many years that we have done that.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:35.840]   Obviously we're doing this because this is what we see,
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.840]   and we have made some progress,
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.840]   but we're nowhere near where we would want to be
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.840]   or where we should be when it comes to prayer.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.840]   I wanted to make it very clear
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:50.840]   that prayer is not just important.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.840]   It's critical.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.840]   I would say fellowship is important.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.840]   Gathering of the church is important.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.840]   Right doctrine, obviously, we would say it's critical.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.840]   Prayer is right there with the Word of God.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.840]   Just as a church cannot be a biblical church
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.840]   without the Word of God being taught
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.840]   and without the people understanding
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.840]   what the Word of God says,
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:16.840]   prayer is just as critical as the Word of God.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.840]   And so we can't feel comfortable
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.840]   if we are lacking in prayer.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.840]   Just like if you're at a church
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.840]   where the Bible's never opened or rarely opened
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.840]   and people don't understand what the Word of God says,
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.840]   you shouldn't feel comfortable.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.840]   There should be a sense of anxiousness
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.840]   that we're not following what the Scripture says
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.840]   because how can we follow what the Scripture says
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.840]   if the Scripture's not being opened?
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.840]   It's the same way if we're not praying.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.840]   When we say we're not praying,
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.840]   we're not just talking about leadership.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.840]   We're talking about the church as a whole
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.840]   and as you individually.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.840]   We are just as much in danger
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.840]   of deception and scheming of the devil
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.840]   as if the Word of God has never been opened
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.840]   if you're not praying.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:05.840]   In fact, the devil has a way of twisting Scripture
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.840]   and uses our own prejudice and our own weaknesses,
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.840]   and our own coveting, and our own biases,
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.840]   and twists the Word of God in the church
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.840]   and individually when we are not praying.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:22.840]   Our intellect is just as corrupted
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.840]   as every other part of our body.
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.840]   And so to rely on our intellect,
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:31.840]   if we use our mind and we give ourselves to study
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.840]   that somehow we are safer,
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.840]   that's a deception.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.840]   Read the Word of God, and we're going to go through it.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.840]   It's just as important.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.840]   And so when we evaluate our church,
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.840]   this is an area that we need to grow in.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:53.840]   We are in the years, I think, our church,
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.840]   that we're getting into our 28th year of our church,
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.840]   and I would say many parts of our church
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.840]   has improved drastically
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.840]   because we've been at it for 28 years.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.840]   So membership has been tweaked, retweaked.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.840]   Covenants have been tweaked, retweaked.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.840]   Bible study, how we're going to do this.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.840]   The roles of the pastors, the organization,
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.840]   the small groups, the home groups.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.840]   These are things that we're constantly working on to improve.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.840]   So I would say when it comes to certain aspects of the church,
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.840]   we are far better off than we were
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.840]   when we first started the church.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.840]   But when it comes to prayer,
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.840]   I would say that we are weaker than we are
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.840]   when we first started.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.840]   There was a period in our church when we had prayer meeting
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.840]   every Friday night, morning prayer,
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.840]   and prayer was emphasized and practiced
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.840]   much more effectively than we do now today.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.840]   And I think as the church got bigger
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.840]   and various other things have been emphasized,
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.840]   that for whatever the reason,
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.840]   the prayer has become weaker.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.840]   And this cannot be.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.840]   We need to emphasize this.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.840]   Even if we only take a few steps
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.840]   toward the right direction,
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.840]   this is important enough that we keep focusing on this.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.840]   So I want all of you to know,
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.840]   again, as we are emphasizing,
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.840]   to be devoted to prayer.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.840]   Not just to be casually praying,
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.840]   not just to sprinkle things with prayer,
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.840]   but to be devoted to prayer.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.840]   Just as we are devoted to know the Word of God
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.840]   and the practice of the Word of God,
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.840]   we need to be devoted to prayer.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:28.840]   There's four things that are taught in this text about prayer.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.840]   Two I'm going to get to today,
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.840]   and two I'm going to get to when I get back.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.840]   First is, it tells us to be devoted to prayer.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:41.840]   Secondly, it teaches us to be devoted through prayer.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.840]   And then it says to keep alert in prayer.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.840]   And to be thankful in prayer.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.840]   So those are the four things that these four verses are going to be,
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.840]   we're going to be emphasizing,
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.840]   particularly in verse two.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.840]   So I'm going to jump to it today.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.840]   To be devoted to prayer.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.840]   Year this year, that we want to
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.840]   go toward the direction of being,
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.840]   not just praying, not just a praying church,
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.840]   but to be devoted to prayer.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.840]   And I could
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.840]   just probably spend the next 20 minutes
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.840]   just reading passage after passage after passage
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.840]   the emphasis on prayer in the New Testament.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.840]   But I just wanted to highlight two verses.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.840]   Romans 12, 12.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.840]   Rejoice in hope, persevering in tribulation,
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.840]   devoted to prayer.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.840]   Devoted to prayer.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.840]   1 Thessalonians 5, 16, 18.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.840]   Rejoice always, pray without ceasing.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.840]   In everything give thanks,
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.840]   for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.840]   Pray without ceasing.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.840]   Now does he actually mean that?
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.840]   Of course he means that.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.840]   This is how important it is.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.840]   That we rejoice,
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.840]   that we give thanks,
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.840]   and that we pray unceasingly.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.840]   So, the natural question is,
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.840]   where are you in your prayer life?
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.840]   Do you pray?
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.840]   Right? That's the first question.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.840]   And typically, in the Western church,
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.840]   if you pray, in any amount of prayer,
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.840]   it's like, you know, I'm praying.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.840]   But the question isn't, are you praying?
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:12.840]   The question is, are you praying unceasingly?
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.840]   Are you devoted to praying?
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.840]   As much as you are devoted to know the Word of God,
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.840]   are you devoted to praying?
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.840]   Because the Word of God emphasizes prayer
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.840]   just as much as right doctrine
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.840]   and study of the Word of God is emphasized.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.840]   We need to be people who are devoted to prayer.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.840]   So naturally, the question we have to ask is,
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.840]   what does it mean to be devoted to prayer?
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.840]   The word "devoted" in other translations
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.840]   is translated to continue earnestly,
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.840]   or to persevere,
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.840]   to be faithful,
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.840]   to be devoted.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.840]   If you are a husband, say,
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:54.840]   and somebody says, you know,
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.840]   "That guy is a really devoted husband."
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.840]   What does that mean?
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.840]   What do we mean when we say he's a devoted husband?
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.840]   He loves his wife, right?
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.840]   He is single-mindedly focused on taking care of his family.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.840]   He provides for them.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.840]   He is committed to his family.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.840]   That's what it means he's a devoted husband, right?
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.840]   He's not just a husband.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.840]   He didn't just become a husband
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:15.840]   because he went through the ceremony.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.840]   They love each other, and legally they're married,
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.840]   and people see them.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.840]   They say, "No, he's a devoted husband."
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.840]   He is focused on taking care of his wife and his children.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.840]   That's what it means to be devoted.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.840]   What does it mean to be a devoted employee?
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.840]   If somebody says,
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.840]   "Oh, he's a really devoted employee,"
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.840]   it means that this person is loyal to this company,
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:38.840]   that they work above and beyond what is expected of them.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.840]   They don't just clock in and clock out.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.840]   They say, "No, he's a devoted employee.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.840]   "He cares about this company.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.840]   "He is loyal to this company."
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.840]   What does it mean to be a devoted student?
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.840]   A devoted student is not somebody
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.840]   who's just coming in and getting the degree and leaving.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.840]   A devoted student is who's committed to learning,
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.840]   maybe staying after hours to ask the professor,
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.840]   do an extra credit.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.840]   He's trying to get as much as he can while he is learning.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:08.840]   That's what it means when we say somebody is devoted.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.840]   Now, what does it mean to be devoted in prayer?
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.840]   In every other aspect, when we say we're devoted,
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:17.840]   we're talking about somebody who is not just a husband,
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.840]   not just an employee, not just a student,
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.840]   but above and beyond.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.840]   He's committed to this.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.840]   This is who he is.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.840]   To be devoted to prayer, obviously,
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.840]   just by the meaning of itself,
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.840]   is the one who is constantly given to prayer,
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.840]   in season and out of season,
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.840]   just like somebody who is preaching the Word of God,
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.840]   that he's committed to this,
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.840]   the sufficiency of the Word of God,
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.840]   the power of the Word of God,
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:47.840]   that he will preach the Word in season and out of season.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.840]   In the same way, someone who is devoted to prayer
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:54.840]   is not somebody who is only praying because it's prayer time,
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.840]   only praying when there's an urgency,
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.840]   only praying in certain circumstances,
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.840]   only when they have plenty of time,
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.840]   when you don't have to wake up early to go to work in the morning.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.840]   Your circumstances don't dictate whether you pray or not.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.840]   You pray unceasingly.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:15.840]   Whether it's a time of peace, turmoil, leisure, busy,
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.840]   or you have plenty of time, day and night,
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:23.840]   there is a sense of urgency to pray.
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.840]   In 2 Chronicles 7, 13-15,
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.840]   this was a verse that we had as a theme,
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.840]   I think, probably over 15 years ago.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.840]   This is after Solomon builds the temple
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.840]   and he dedicates to the Lord,
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.840]   in the dedication of the temple, says this,
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:42.840]   "If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain,
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.840]   and if I command the locusts to devour the land,
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.840]   or if I send pestilence among the people,"
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.840]   let me stop right there, right?
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.840]   He said, "If I put you in a circumstance where you are desperate,"
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.840]   maybe prior to this you didn't know.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.840]   You're living casually because your bills are paid
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.840]   and everything's going well.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.840]   He said, "Deliberately," he says,
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:07.840]   "God brings turmoil into your life to force you to pray."
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:10.840]   He says, "And my people who are called by my name,
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.840]   they humble themselves and pray."
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:15.840]   Humble themselves.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.840]   Humility and prayer go hand in hand.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.840]   You can be filled with the Word of God
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.840]   and be filled with pride and never pray
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:26.840]   and feel like you are closer to God.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.840]   And you are deceived.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.840]   Whenever there is pride in an individual,
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.840]   he is not close to God.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.840]   And sometimes a deep study of the Word of God without prayer
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:40.840]   causes a man to be very, very proud.
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.840]   That's why prayer is so important
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:48.840]   because a prayer is an active, willful giving to humility.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:54.840]   "If my people humble themselves and pray and seek my face," right?
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.840]   Prayer isn't just an act of praying.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.840]   It isn't just getting on our knees and saying the right words.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.840]   It's seeking God.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.840]   You can study the Word of God to gain knowledge.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.840]   You can study the Word of God just to know what is right and wrong,
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.840]   what is right theology, what is wrong theology.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:15.840]   But he says if you want to seek God, you have to pray.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.840]   You have to pray.
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:23.840]   If God causes you and calls you to humble yourself and pray
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:27.840]   and seek my face and turn from my wicked ways,
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.840]   then I will turn from heaven.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.840]   Then I will hear from heaven and forgive their sins and will heal the land.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:37.840]   Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:44.840]   When things go wrong, we naturally think that if we do A, B, C, D, not realizing,
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.840]   could God have done that to cause us to pray?
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.840]   Could whatever that may be going wrong in my life,
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.840]   could God have ordained that to bring you to him,
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.840]   to recognize that the answer is him?
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:04.840]   Not our organization, not our might, not our power, but him.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.840]   He says he will forgive us.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.840]   He will heal the land.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:13.840]   He will make it right if we humble ourselves and pray.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.840]   But the natural question that comes with that is when there's an emergency,
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:22.840]   when things are urgent, when God puts you in a certain place where you need to pray,
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.840]   most people pray.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:29.840]   If you're sick and desperate, somebody that you love is in a dire situation,
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.840]   we ask for prayer.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.840]   We seek prayer.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.840]   We want to pray.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.840]   You wake up praying.
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:38.840]   But what if that's not the situation you're in?
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:41.840]   There's a lot of people in our church who are in this situation
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.840]   where they are in desperate need of prayer, a lot of choice,
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.840]   especially in the last two, three weeks.
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.840]   We've been getting so many phone calls and e-mails of people who are suffering
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:54.840]   with various things and sudden deaths in our churches, in our church.
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.840]   But what if you're not in that situation?
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.840]   What if there is no desperation?
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:03.840]   What if your bills are paid, your children are healthy, your job is secure,
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:07.840]   you live in a nice, comfortable home?
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:14.840]   How do you pray when there's nothing urgent that's happening in our life?
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:19.840]   The only reason why we don't feel a sense of urgency is because we're not sober.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:24.840]   A sense of urgency doesn't--if you only feel a sense of urgency
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:29.840]   when your own personal life, your own children, and your own health is at stake,
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.840]   then we are living self-centered lives.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.840]   We're living in a world where condemnation and judgment is awaiting
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.840]   for everybody who dies.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.840]   And we have been called to be a light to this world.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.840]   And so to say that there is nothing urgent for us to pray for
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.840]   is because we are not sober.
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.840]   Because we're not thinking about anybody else but me.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:54.840]   As long as my children are taken care of, as long as I'm healthy,
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:59.840]   and my closest friends are healthy, I don't have anything urgent.
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.840]   It's because we have been entangled and been deceived.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:14.840]   If comfort will keep you from praying, Satan will make sure that you live in comfort.
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:19.840]   If comfort and ease is what's going to keep you away from seeking the Lord
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:25.840]   with a sense of urgency, it is not the Lord that gives you comfort.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.840]   The Lord will do whatever, because the greatest thing that a child of God
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:34.840]   would actively participate in is to seek him with all our might.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:40.840]   So whatever keeps you from seeking him with all your might may not be from God.
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:43.840]   That your bills may be paid, and you may stay healthy,
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:50.840]   and everything in your life is at ease, and that may not be God doing that.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:54.840]   Satan is scheming, if comfort, ease, and safety is what is keeping you
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:43:01.840]   from desperately seeking the Lord, Satan will make sure that that's exactly where you stay.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:06.840]   The early church was devoted to prayer.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:11.840]   Now we didn't see that before Christ went to the cross.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:16.840]   We didn't see that right as he was going to the cross, Gethsemane.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:21.840]   But as soon as Jesus is crucified, and he's resurrected, and he ascends,
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:25.840]   we see them constantly devoted to prayer.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:29.840]   By human standard, the early church should have died.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.840]   Their main leader, Jesus, is crucified.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:38.840]   A few men who were trained just for a few years,
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.840]   who failed miserably right before their leader leaves.
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:45.840]   The most powerful nation of that time, the Roman government,
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.840]   was actively trying to squash them.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:52.840]   Their own countrymen, everywhere they turned, was abandoning them
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.840]   and forbidding them to preach.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:44:01.840]   And according to Apostle Paul, not many of them were influential or wise or smart.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.840]   So the early church, according to human standard, should have been squashed
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.840]   and should have never made it out of the first century.
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:11.840]   And yet we see that they thrived.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:15.840]   Not only did they thrive after 2,000 years, even if you're not a Christian,
[00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:22.840]   there's no other influence was greater than Jesus Christ.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.840]   We see in Acts 1.14, as soon as Jesus ascends,
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.840]   what is the first thing that that book of Acts tells us?
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.840]   They were meeting together devoted to prayer.
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.840]   Acts 2.42, after the Pentecost, they get together.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.840]   It said the whole church devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching,
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.840]   fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayer.
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:46.840]   Acts 3.1, when the first miracles reported,
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:50.840]   John and James were going to the temple because it was our to pray,
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:53.840]   and they were devoted to praying.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:57.840]   In Acts 6.4, the first issue comes into the church.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:02.840]   It said we cannot be distracted because the apostles needed to be devoted
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.840]   to the word and to prayer.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:09.840]   When Apostle Paul was selected with Barnabas to go on his missionary journey,
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:14.840]   the Bible says that they were praying and fasting to confirm them,
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:15.840]   to ordain them.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:20.840]   So over and over again, we see that the early church was devoted to prayer.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:25.840]   Now, in our Bibles, the title of the book of Acts, obviously it's Acts,
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:30.840]   or if you go some other translations or somebody to say Acts of the Apostles,
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.840]   I've seen some Bibles put that as a title.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:41.840]   I think that's misleading because that's not inspired.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.840]   That was something that the men who divided up the chapters
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:46.840]   and they put titles on there.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:52.840]   But I think the right understanding of the book of Acts is not the Acts
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.840]   of the Apostles.
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:58.840]   It's really the act of the Holy Spirit through prayer.
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:01.840]   So if there's a central theme going through all of the book of Acts,
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:06.840]   it's not Apostle Peter and then Apostle Paul and chapter 13 and on.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.840]   You have the main central figure as Apostle Peter,
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.840]   main central figure to Apostle Paul.
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:11.840]   No.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.840]   The central figure throughout the whole 28 chapters is the work
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:18.840]   of the Holy Spirit through prayer.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.840]   He says, "You will be my witnesses," in Acts 1:8,
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:24.840]   "when the Holy Spirit comes upon you in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria,
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.840]   to the remotest part of the world."
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.840]   So if you look at the book of Acts, it's Acts 1:8 being fulfilled
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:35.840]   by the power of the Holy Spirit when his people pray.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.840]   That's a theme that you will see all throughout the 28 chapters
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.840]   of the book of Acts.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:42.840]   As they prayed, the Holy Spirit worked.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:46.840]   As they prayed, the Holy Spirit worked.
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:51.840]   That's why they were devoted to praying because they realized
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:54.840]   that the power was not in them.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:58.840]   It was not in their organization.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.840]   It was in God.
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:04.840]   So they were constantly seeking God.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:06.840]   Constantly seeking God.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:09.840]   They were constantly desperate to seek God.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:17.840]   So I can't emphasize enough, we must be devoted to prayer.
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:22.840]   Not just pray, but be devoted to prayer.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:29.840]   Secondly, same phrase, it says, "But be devoted through prayer."
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:35.840]   Now, I'm not just playing word games here because the word "prayer" here
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:41.840]   is in the instrumental dative, which means nothing for most of you.
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:45.840]   Basically, in Greek grammar, what it means is the imperative
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:49.840]   in this verse is to be devoted.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.840]   The commandment is to be devoted.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:56.840]   To prayer is the dative, but it's an instrumental dative,
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:03.840]   meaning that the way that you will be devoted is through prayer.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.840]   Hopefully it's not too early that I didn't lose you.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.840]   If you were to understand this text properly,
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:12.840]   it means to be devoted through prayer.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:16.840]   Prayer is the avenue in which you will be devoted.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:19.840]   Prayer is the avenue in which you will continue,
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:23.840]   in which you will persevere.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:27.840]   See, Colossians 3, 1-4, in summary of Christology,
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.840]   about Jesus Christ being the head of all things,
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:32.840]   and everything was made by him and for him,
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.840]   and all things are held through him.
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.840]   So basically, if you want to study Christology,
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.840]   about who Christ is, Colossians is the book that you want to go to.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:44.840]   It's one of the books that you want to go to, or book of Hebrews.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.840]   But at the end of that, he says,
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:48.840]   "Therefore, if you have been raised up with Christ,
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.840]   "keep seeking the things above,
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.840]   "where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.840]   "Set your mind on the things above,
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:55.840]   "not on the things that are on earth,
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.840]   "for you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:01.840]   "When Christ, who is our life, is revealed,
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.840]   "then you also will be revealed with him in glory."
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:09.840]   What he means by this, when he says, "Devote yourself to prayer,"
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:13.840]   is that this is the calling for every Christian,
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.840]   that our life now is hidden with Christ,
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.840]   to keep our mind and our thought and our life
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.840]   eagerly waiting for the coming of Christ.
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.840]   Because we're dead now, we're hidden with Christ.
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:29.840]   So the question is like, "Oh, where do I fit?
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:30.840]   "What is my calling?"
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:34.840]   So much attention is given to my life.
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:36.840]   What should I do?
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.840]   But he says, "No, your life is hidden.
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:41.840]   "You've been crucified with Christ.
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:42.840]   "It doesn't matter what you're calling.
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:43.840]   "It doesn't matter what you're--
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.840]   "Oh, am I supposed to do this? Am I supposed to do that?"
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.840]   He said, "No, you're dead."
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:52.840]   The question is, what brings the most glory to him?
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:56.840]   To seek his kingdom first.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:00.840]   Now, our Lord knows how difficult of a challenge this is
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:03.840]   because we naturally are concerned about our bills being paid.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.840]   What mother and father is not concerned about
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:07.840]   the well-being of their children?
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.840]   And so naturally, living on this earth,
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:16.840]   we're going to be constantly entangled with the life of this world.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.840]   So when he says after giving that commandment,
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:25.840]   in chapter 4, he's given us the tool to remain focused,
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:31.840]   to be devoted, to persevere, to continue through prayer.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:36.840]   Part of the reason why we are not sober is because we're not praying,
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:41.840]   that our flesh is reacting just like any other flesh.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:42.840]   You've got to pay your bills.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.840]   You've got to know who you're going to marry.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:47.840]   Is it a good time to buy a house?
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:48.840]   Is it a bad time to buy a house?
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.840]   What should I invest in?
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:51.840]   Do I have enough money for retirement,
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:53.840]   or is my children going to be taken care of?
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:58.840]   These are concerns of every human being, naturally.
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:03.840]   So in the midst of this, how do we remain sober?
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:07.840]   How do we constantly get reminded of where we're at,
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.840]   the spiritual battle that we're in?
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:13.840]   He says to continue through prayer.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.840]   Prayer is what's going to cause us to be sober.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:20.840]   Prayer is what's going to cause us to look to Christ's coming
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:24.840]   and not to be so entangled with what's right in front of us
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:30.840]   that we continually forget that all this is going to end.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:34.840]   In 1 Peter 4:7, it says, "The end of all things is near.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:37.840]   Therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:41.840]   for the purpose of prayer."
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:42.840]   So that we can pray.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:45.840]   He doesn't simply say pray so that you can stay sober,
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.840]   but prayer in and of itself is what we need to engage in
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:49.840]   to be more sober.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.840]   1 Peter 3:7, "You husbands, in the same way,
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:53.840]   live with your wives in an understanding way
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.840]   as with someone weaker, since she is a woman,
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.840]   and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life,
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.840]   so that your prayers will not be hindered."
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.840]   In other words, be a good husband
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.840]   so that you can be effective in prayer.
[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.840]   I mean, just even logically think about that.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:13.840]   Even logically think about that.
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:16.840]   That we devote ourselves to hard work, to be disciplined,
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:23.840]   to get right theology, to scream, to march, to organize,
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:28.840]   versus God showing up.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:32.840]   Versus God and his spirit being engaged.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:35.840]   Which is more powerful?
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:37.840]   Which is more effective?
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:41.840]   Which should get more attention?
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.840]   Whatever causes God to be more engaged
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:48.840]   is where we need to put our priority.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:52.840]   Whichever causes God to hear us and respond to us
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:57.840]   and answer us should get the greater priority.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:02.840]   But our natural instinct is, "What can I do?
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.840]   What do I need to do?"
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:07.840]   And we focus our attention on that, and we do all this,
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:09.840]   and then we get frustrated when we don't see fruit.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:11.840]   And the Bible says, "If you don't abide in me,
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:14.840]   you cannot bear fruit."
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:20.840]   The central thing about abiding in Christ is prayer.
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.840]   To live according to the word of God and to pray,
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.840]   to bring us to him.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:29.840]   It is not the activity of prayer that makes the prayer so effective.
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:32.840]   It is who we are praying to.
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.840]   "If my people humble themselves and seek my face."
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:40.840]   Prayer is the avenue that God has given us to seek his face.
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:43.840]   The purpose of salvation is that the barrier between us
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:45.840]   and God has been taken away,
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:49.840]   and so we have a free access to the throne of grace.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:56.840]   So theology points to the fact that the throne has been opened.
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:00.840]   And we celebrate the open door to Christ.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:03.840]   So when we study the word of God, we celebrate.
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:06.840]   Look at that awesome door that's been opened to us.
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.840]   Look how glorious God is.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:10.840]   That's what theology does.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:15.840]   But if that's all we do, all you're doing is celebrating the open door
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:17.840]   and never using it.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:21.840]   All we are doing is highlighting how glorious God seems
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:26.840]   because now we can see him without going to him.
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.840]   You see why prayer is so important?
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:34.840]   Theology tells us, instructs us, empowers us,
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:38.840]   but prayer is what takes us to him.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:41.840]   We have to pray.
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:44.840]   We have to be devoted through prayer.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:48.840]   Jesus says repeatedly in the book of John,
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:49.840]   "I am the bread of life.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:50.840]   I am the light of the world.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:51.840]   I am the gate.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:52.840]   I am the good shepherd.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.840]   I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.840]   I am the way and the truth and the life."
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.840]   And then he ends the seven "I am" statements by saying,
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:02.840]   "I am the true vine."
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:04.840]   "I am the true vine."
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:09.840]   Vine basically was illustrating that you have to be continued with me.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.840]   You have to be connected with me.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:14.840]   If you're going to bear any fruit,
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:21.840]   James says you're frustrated because you do not ask.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.840]   You're frustrated because you're not praying.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:27.840]   Whatever frustration that you feel,
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:32.840]   our natural inclination is seek counsel to change our circumstance,
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.840]   to change the people around us, change the people around us,
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:37.840]   change all this around us.
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.840]   Then I can accomplish what we want.
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:44.840]   He says no, your frustration comes directly from the fact that you don't pray,
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:47.840]   that you don't realize that God is the answer,
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:49.840]   that you somehow think you're the answer
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:53.840]   and God's going to empower you to be the answer.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:55.840]   No, God is the answer.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.840]   There's a reason why he chose uneducated men,
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:01.840]   why he humbled these people,
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:04.840]   why he chose people who weren't powerful,
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:09.840]   because it's much easier to teach people who are already humble to be humble
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:12.840]   so that they would recognize who he is,
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:14.840]   so that they would come to him.
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.840]   So if you're frustrated, if something's going wrong,
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:20.840]   or even when things seem to be going right,
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:25.840]   a humble man is a man who is constantly seeking the Lord in prayer.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:29.840]   In John 15, 7, he says, "If you want to bear fruit because I am the true vine,
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:34.840]   you need to abide," and the word "abide" is used just in nine verses, 11 times.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:37.840]   The last of the seven "I am" statements, "I am, I am, I am."
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:42.840]   But he said, "You need to abide, abide, abide, abide, abide, abide," 11 times he says.
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:47.840]   And the word means to remain, to continue.
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:50.840]   Now, if you weren't sleeping,
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:52.840]   you probably remember from the beginning of the sermon,
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:56.840]   the word "devote" means to persevere, to continue.
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:59.840]   He said if you want to persevere, if you want to continue,
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.840]   you need to what? Abide.
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:06.840]   And that's basically what this text is saying.
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:11.840]   To devote yourself, to continue, to persevere, through what? Through prayer.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:15.840]   So John 15, 7 says, "Abide in me," in my words, "Abide in you,
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:19.840]   and ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you."
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:21.840]   Do you see the connection?
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:27.840]   Colossians 4, 2 and John 15, 7 is saying the same thing.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:31.840]   If you want to bear fruit, you need to pray.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:33.840]   You need to be devoted to prayer.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:35.840]   1 John 5, 14 through 15.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:37.840]   "This is the confidence which we have before him,
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:41.840]   that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us;
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.840]   and if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask,
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:51.840]   we know that we have the request which we have asked from him."
[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:54.840]   If you're going to devote any of your energy into anything,
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:58.840]   first and foremost, not only, but first and foremost,
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:03.840]   we must be devoted to prayer.
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:06.840]   Pray before you read the word of God,
[00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:08.840]   so that your heart will not be twisted,
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:14.840]   so that you do not twist the word of God like Satan does.
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.840]   And you think, "No, but, you know, not me.
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:17.840]   I'm not deceived."
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:19.840]   You're already deceived.
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:21.840]   To think that you're not going to be deceived,
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:24.840]   you're already deceived.
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:28.840]   Because our mind, our hearts, our covenant
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:33.840]   can easily be twisted by Satan, we have to pray.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:36.840]   We have to cling to him.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:40.840]   He says, James 4:2, "You do not have because you do not ask."
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:44.840]   I pray that that verse will ring heavily
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:47.840]   in the hearts of our church.
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:50.840]   "You do not have because you do not ask."
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:53.840]   So before you seek counsel, before you want to change,
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:55.840]   before you express your frustration,
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:59.840]   ask yourself, "Did you pray?"
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:02.840]   Before you demand things of other people,
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:06.840]   before you labor to get things done,
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:11.840]   ask yourself, "Are you devoted to prayer?"
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:14.840]   If you say you have been devoted to prayer
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:18.840]   and the word of God, then you can go to step two.
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:20.840]   "What should I do?"
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:24.840]   But don't go to step two until you've done step one.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:28.840]   Spurgeon was asked the question, "Which is more important,
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:31.840]   the word of God or prayer?"
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:34.840]   And Spurgeon answered, "You tell me.
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:36.840]   When we breathe, which is more important,
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:41.840]   breathing out or breathing in?"
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:44.840]   It's equally important.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:48.840]   When we are not praying, the word of God actually damages us
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:52.840]   because it fills us with pride and confidence
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:55.840]   that we can only have when God is engaged.
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:57.840]   We must pray.
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:01.840]   So the natural question is, as we're going to New Year,
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:05.840]   the practical application, I want to put up some of the things
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.840]   that we already have that we want to encourage you.
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:13.840]   If you can put up the next slide.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.840]   Yeah, can you put it all up, A, B, C?
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:21.840]   No, no, no, the other one.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.840]   Can you put it up?
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.840]   Oh, is it all separated?
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.840]   Can you go--okay.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.840]   So first of all, what are we planning for prayer?
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:34.840]   First, corporately, there's already various prayer meetings
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:37.840]   going on at church, right?
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:38.840]   There's college prayer meetings.
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.840]   There's BAM prayer meetings.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.840]   There's also family prayer meetings.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:45.840]   So we encourage you to take advantage of things that are already here.
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.840]   Instead of seeking like, "Oh, we're going to do more things.
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:48.840]   Are we going to do morning prayer?
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.840]   Are we going to do Friday night prayer?"
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.840]   We'll get to that in a minute.
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.840]   First and foremost, take advantage of what's already here.
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.840]   So if you're not taking advantage of what's already here
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:02.840]   and say you're looking for something new to add to the calendar,
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.840]   you're just going to be filling your--our church is going to be filled
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.840]   with schedules and people aren't coming, right?
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:10.840]   So I encourage you to what's already here to commit to that.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:12.840]   So if you want to devote yourself to prayer, you know,
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:17.840]   I want to pray corporately, there's corporate prayers going on,
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.840]   family ministry, BAM ministry, college ministry.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.840]   So ask whatever ministry you're a part of.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.840]   Say, "Hey, how can I participate in that?"
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:27.840]   And I know that because I'm overseeing the family ministry,
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:31.840]   every once a month, Saturday morning, we have a group of people
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:34.840]   that gather together, pray for the issues of the church,
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.840]   and to join that meeting to pray corporately, to be devoted to prayer.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.840]   There's monthly prayer meetings that's going on.
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:44.840]   So right now, if you're not in the habit of coming and praying together with that,
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.840]   that we encourage you to commit to that.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:52.840]   And if you are coming to that, to come to it more deliberately.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:54.840]   Pray before you come.
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:58.840]   Pray when you come, make a list of things that you need to pray for.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.840]   Maybe even fast that day, before you come, so that we can pray more effectively,
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:08.840]   so that we can make the most of what we already have.
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:12.840]   There's weekly gatherings that are happening, right?
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.840]   Find out what's happening around there.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.840]   There are other people who are organically getting together for prayer,
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:22.840]   and I'm very encouraged to hear that there are small groups happening
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.840]   where they're praying just two people or four people throughout the week.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.840]   Find out what's going on and see if you can join them.
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.840]   These are things that are already happening.
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:35.840]   One of the things that we implemented was before church begins,
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:37.840]   we said we wanted to dedicate this time.
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.840]   That's why 10, 15 minutes before church starts,
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.840]   we said, you know, try to keep the noise in this room down,
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.840]   so that you can take some time to pray.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:50.840]   So there are already things that we have implemented asking you to participate in.
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.840]   So instead of looking for new things,
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:57.840]   first and foremost, commit to the things that are already here, corporately.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.840]   Come early. Pray.
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:02.840]   If you're in the habit of showing up five minutes late or ten minutes late to service,
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:06.840]   or you come right on time, maybe this is a way to come early
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:08.840]   and to be devoted to praying.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:13.840]   Individually, make time in the morning to pray.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.840]   Now, I know some of you guys are not morning people,
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.840]   but why I say morning prayer is more important
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:22.840]   is because you spend the rest of the day not sober,
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.840]   and you fill the day with memories of things that have happened that day,
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:29.840]   and at the end of the day you try to pray, your mind is not alert.
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.840]   It's always most effective when you pray in the morning, even if it is harder.
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:39.840]   The first thing that you do is to seek the Lord and depend on Him and to pray.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:42.840]   Now, I'm not saying what time, I'm not saying where you need to go,
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.840]   but to be committed to pray in the morning.
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.840]   Start the day saying, "I need you."
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.840]   Start the day by saying, "I need you.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.840]   I don't want my mind to wander and be entangled with things
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.840]   that I don't want to be entangled with. I need you."
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:56.840]   So commit to morning prayer.
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.840]   Make a list of things to pray for.
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:03.840]   A lot of times you close your eyes and your mind starts to wander
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.840]   of all the things that need to be getting done,
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.840]   and it's hard to focus.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:13.840]   So if that's you, make a list of things to pray for.
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.840]   And after a while, when it becomes a habit, it's much easier.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:21.840]   But in the beginning, if that's you, make a list.
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:23.840]   Keep a prayer journal.
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.840]   Sometimes we pray for things and we forget that we prayed about it,
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.840]   and when God answers, it's just like, "Oh, it just happened."
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.840]   But learn to praise God.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.840]   So keep a journal of prayer.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:37.840]   If you have a hard time praying by yourself,
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.840]   make an appointment with somebody else.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.840]   Hey, you want to pray together?
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.840]   There was a time when people would get together for morning coffee somewhere,
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:48.840]   just to get together and drink coffee, do devotions, and pray together.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.840]   Define people.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.840]   If you say, "You know, the leaders didn't contact me."
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:57.840]   "Didn't contact me" is like, "There's three pastors."
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:01.840]   If you're waiting for the leaders to somehow take you step by step,
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:04.840]   obviously it's not going to happen in this size of a church.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:07.840]   Get people around you that want to pray together.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:12.840]   Whoever you're complaining with, pray with that person.
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.840]   Turn the negative into positive.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:18.840]   Whoever you're grumbling with, that's the person that's closest to you.
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.840]   Turn that into prayer.
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.840]   Grumble to God.
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:25.840]   "Why are you--" See what God says.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.840]   So get together with that person.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.840]   Make an appointment with that person.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.840]   And maybe, if it's not every week,
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:35.840]   get in the habit of fellowshipping in prayer.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.840]   And then read a book on prayer.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.840]   There's so many good books out there on prayer,
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:43.840]   but the book that I recommend above all the other books is E.M. Bounds.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.840]   E.M. Bounds on prayer.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.840]   It's so thorough.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:52.840]   There's so many chapters in there that I would highly recommend to pray.
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:56.840]   Going forward, there are certain things that we want to establish.
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.840]   We want to bring fasting back into the church.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:01.840]   There was a period when we used to fast for every mission group,
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:03.840]   every event, everything that was happening.
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:06.840]   And so we want to bring fasting back.
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:10.840]   And we'll probably explain a little bit more at the next members' meeting.
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:13.840]   Possible open Zoom prayer meetings so that people can't physically come.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:17.840]   Maybe when your children are sleeping that we can have time to pray together online.
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:24.840]   There's possibly that we may open some Friday nights outside of our monthly prayer meetings
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:27.840]   so that we can pray together at night on Friday nights.
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:30.840]   There was a time in our church when every Friday night,
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.840]   after Bible study, we would get together,
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.840]   and the whole church would be there praying together
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.840]   at some point when our church was smaller.
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:39.840]   And so we're thinking of implementing some of these things.
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:44.840]   But more than the newer stuff, to implement prayer,
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:47.840]   what's already here, to be devoted to prayer.
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:51.840]   So I want to finish today, because our Korea team is leaving this Thursday,
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.840]   to take some time to pray over 3/4.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:57.840]   It says, "Praying at the same time for us as well,
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:00.840]   that God will open up to us a door for the Word,
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:02.840]   so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ,
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.840]   for which I have also been imprisoned,
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:06.840]   that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak."
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:09.840]   So while our team is out in Korea,
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:13.840]   we are running an English camp with the local students there,
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:15.840]   and hopefully through these relationships,
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.840]   to be able to share the gospel with them.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:20.840]   And as I shared before, what's happening in Korea spiritually,
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:25.840]   basically it's just that Christianity is falling apart in the younger generation.
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.840]   And so for whatever the reason,
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:32.840]   the foreigners who are able to speak English have an easier time
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.840]   connecting with the students than the local Christians there.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.840]   And so we're using that opportunity to get in there,
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.840]   connect with the students and hopefully share the gospel.
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.840]   So if you can pray for open doors for the gospel,
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.840]   that the connections that we're making
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:49.840]   will help us to see a clear path that we can go and labor there.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.840]   Pray that we would make the most of the opportunity.
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:55.840]   We're only there for about six days, six, seven days.
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:58.840]   It is very cold, right?
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.840]   But we're hoping that the short time that we have,
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.840]   that we would make the most of the opportunity,
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.840]   and that we would be joyful and thankful in heart
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.840]   with whatever the Lord provides.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:11.840]   So if you could take some time to pray for that,
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.840]   and again, for the sake of time for the service,
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.840]   we're going to have to end it, but let me pray.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:20.840]   And we're going to post this somewhere on our website or Facebook page,
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.840]   and if you guys can keep the team in prayer.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.840]   And then there is another team leaving to India next week,
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:29.840]   and hopefully Pastor Mark will be able to share that next week.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.840]   Okay? Let's pray.
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:37.840]   Father, help us to be a church devoted to prayer,
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:41.840]   not just to know that in theology or in theory.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:47.840]   Help us, Lord God, to be known not just to be a church that loves the Word,
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:53.840]   but people who are humbled and constantly seeking your face.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:57.840]   We know, Father, we are helpless against the schemes of the devil.
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:03.840]   So help us to lift our eyes towards you, people who are dependent on you.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.840]   We pray, Father God, for our Korea team,
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:09.840]   that you would open the door for the gospel,
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:13.840]   that we may find work, Lord God, that we can engage in that will bear fruit.
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:16.840]   Help us, Lord God, to make meaningful contact,
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:21.840]   and with the students that we will have opportunity to talk to and to share with,
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:25.840]   that we would make the most of the time that we have in this short period.
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:29.840]   And help us, Lord God, as a team to be joyful, to be thankful,
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:33.840]   that even in this, that we would do it for the sake of your glory.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:37.840]   So may your name and your name alone be magnified through all of this.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.840]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:42.840]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:10:05.840]   [music]
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:14.840]   I love the voice of Jesus on the cross of Calvary.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:18.840]   He declares His work is finished.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:23.840]   He has spoken this all to me.
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:28.840]   Though the sun has ceased its shining,
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:32.840]   Though the war appeared as lust,
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:37.840]   Christ hath triumphed over me.
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:50.840]   It was finished upon the cross.
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:54.840]   Now the curse, it has been broken.
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:59.840]   Jesus paid the price for me.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:03.840]   All the pardon He has offered,
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:08.840]   Great the welcome that I receive.
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:13.840]   Lonely I approach my Father,
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.840]   Clothed in Jesus' righteousness.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:22.840]   There is no more guilt.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:44.840]   It was finished upon the cross.
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:48.840]   Death was once my great opponent.
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:53.840]   Fear once had a hold on me.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:58.840]   But the Son who died to save us
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:10.840]   Knows that we would be free indeed.
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:15.840]   Death was once my great opponent.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:20.840]   Fear once had a hold on me.
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:24.840]   But the Son who died to save us
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:34.840]   Knows that we would be free indeed.
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:39.840]   Free from every plan of darkness.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:43.840]   Free to live and free to die.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:47.840]   Death is dead and Christ is risen.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:52.840]   It was finished upon the cross.
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:57.840]   Onward to eternal glory
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:01.840]   To my Savior and my God.
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:06.840]   I rejoice in Jesus' face.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:10.840]   It was finished upon the cross.
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:15.840]   It was finished upon the cross.
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:30.840]   It was finished upon the cross.
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.840]   Let's pray.
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.840]   Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.840]   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:38.840]   and eternal love of God the Father,
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.840]   strengthen, restore, and build the Church,
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:43.840]   that Christ and Christ alone may be magnified.
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.840]   Amen.
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:50.840]   It's said to some,
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:55.840]   they called Him Jesus.
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:14:00.840]   He came to love.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:05.840]   He went forth again.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:10.840]   He lived and died.
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:15.840]   Two by my heart.
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:25.840]   An empty grave is there to save your days.
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.840]   Because He lived,
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:35.840]   I can face tomorrow.
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:40.840]   Because He lived,
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:45.840]   all fear is gone.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:50.840]   Because I've known,
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:55.840]   He holds the future.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.840]   And life is worth the living,
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:05.840]   just because we live it.
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:08.840]   Amen.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:12.840]   Amen.
