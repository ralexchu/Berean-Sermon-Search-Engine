[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.360]   Turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.320]   Hebrews chapter 12, we're going to be reading from verse 18 through 24, and we're going
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.920]   to be finishing up what I started a few weeks ago.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.560]   Okay.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.440]   And I won't be making any promises anymore.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.960]   Right?
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.920]   Hebrews chapter 12, verse 18 through 24.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.200]   And again, I'm going to finish up the third point that I started last week, but wasn't
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.980]   able to finish.
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.160]   Reading from the NASB.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.880]   For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched, and to a blazing fire, and to
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.120]   darkness and gloom and whirlwind, and to the blast of a trumpet and the sound of words,
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.400]   which sound was such that those who heard begged that no further word be spoken to them.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.880]   For they could not bear the command, if even a beast touches the mountain, it will be stoned.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.480]   And so terrible was the sight that Moses said, I am full of fear and trembling.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.600]   But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.760]   and to the myriads of angels, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, who
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.160]   are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.200]   made perfect, and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood,
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.120]   which speaks better than the blood of Abel.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.360]   Let's pray.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.160]   Heavenly Father, as we come before you, we ask, Lord God, that you would protect this
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.120]   pulpit, that you would use it, Lord God, to declare your word and your word alone.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.560]   I pray that you would soften our hearts, open our ears, and give us wills to apply.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.000]   May your word be proclaimed, and as you have ordained it, not return until it has accomplished
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.520]   the purpose you have given it for.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.880]   And so we pray for guidance in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.820]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.600]   In your memory of your life up to this point, whether it's 18 or 60 or 70, however old you
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.520]   may be, up to this point, what is your happiest memory in life?
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.700]   You know, just think for a second.
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.480]   As I was preparing this message, I was kind of contemplating, what's the happiest memory
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.480]   that I remember?
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.320]   There's three distinct things that I remember, and I remember the first memory was in 1975,
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.280]   when my father came to the United States first in 1974 to get his doctorate.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.440]   And so we were separated for about a year, and then when we first came in 1975, I remember
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:58.740]   the just so eager to see the plane doors opening so we can run to our dad and then be reunited
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.740]   with him.
[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.960]   And so that's one of the most fondest memory I have of childhood.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.320]   And then as an adult, the fondest memory that I remember is when I got married and Esther
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.960]   and I, we were driving up to San Francisco, you know, on our honeymoon.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.960]   And so that was our honeymoon.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.800]   We were just kind of driving up and we were playing John Gibson.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.160]   Some of you guys may know who he is, may or may not know who he is, but he was the only
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.800]   Christian tape we had.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.040]   And so we probably played that about 20 times.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.480]   So every once in a while I hear that tape, and to this day, it reminds me of that drive
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.080]   up the, I think the Pacific Coast Highway that we took the long, you know, nice route,
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.080]   right?
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.080]   We were in no hurry.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.680]   And I remember just fond memory of that, just being so happy, you know, that finally I was
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.560]   able to marry Esther.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.000]   And then the other memory that I remember very specifically was, you know, Esther already
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.880]   had two miscarriages.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.440]   And when she got pregnant with Jeremy, the doctor already told us that she couldn't have,
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.000]   that it was a miscarriage.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.900]   And the doctor already told us that she couldn't have children in the normal way.
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.680]   And so that we were already talking about possibly adopting in the future, maybe that's
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.680]   what God wants.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.200]   And then, so she didn't really do anything for the third pregnancy.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.560]   She actually went to Magic Mountain because I was a youth pastor, a college pastor.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.920]   So we took our group.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.720]   She went on the revolution, you know, and because she liked roller coasters, because
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.520]   she, we thought she already had the miscarriage.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.120]   And then she went back by herself for a follow-up meeting.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.920]   And then she came back with the ultrasound and said, "Oh, the baby lived."
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.240]   And then since then we've had three other children, right?
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.000]   And so I just remember that very distinctly that day when she came back with that just
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.360]   shock and excitement.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.840]   And those are memories that I can think very distinctly that I remember.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.120]   But of all the memories that I have, and as great as those memories are, the first day
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:03.360]   that I met Christ is by far anything that I've ever experienced.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.880]   Because I knew that day that my life would completely change, right?
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.000]   You know, some people, it takes them time, it's a process to understand what was happening.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.320]   But that day, every bitterness, every anger, every regret, all of a sudden it disappeared
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.320]   when I met Christ.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.240]   And even though this is a Christ that I sang about, you know, memorized verses in Sunday
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.840]   school, but this was different.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.840]   He was real.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.600]   He wasn't just a figure, you know, some big picture God.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.600]   He was personal.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.960]   He answered my prayer.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.840]   And I met him for the first time.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.600]   And you know, our small group leaders told me that I was singing in my sleep, you know,
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.280]   the new songs that I learned, and that I was just mumbling as we were driving down, you
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.280]   know.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.840]   And to this day, when I think of like one that stands out, as great as those memories
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.580]   are, the day that I met Christ was the happiest day of my life.
[00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.580]   And it changed me forever.
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:14.640]   The Bible says that Zion is a place where we're headed, that as great as whatever you've
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.160]   experienced up to this point, pales in comparison to the joy and the celebration that we're
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.240]   going to have when we meet Christ.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.120]   And so we talked about how in the previous passage that it's a place of celebration,
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:34.200]   and it was equated with a wedding banquet, and the angels are going to be there celebrating
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.760]   with us.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.940]   The elders, the pure church, right?
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.280]   Not just people who are gathered because of whatever the reason, but the pure church is
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.360]   going to be gathered together.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.640]   And he says, along with that, God who's the judge, who's going to protect us and guide
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.160]   us and lead us in righteousness, he will be there, obviously.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.880]   And then the text that we're looking at that I want to get to where he says, this is where
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.340]   the spirits of the righteous will be made perfect.
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.600]   Spirit of the righteous who will be made perfect, meaning that those who believed in God who
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.380]   went ahead of us, that's where the final destination is going to be.
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.140]   And ultimately it will be our final destination.
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:23.160]   That what he started here, he will perfect it when Christ comes.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.800]   But that word perfect is a theologically rich word, teleos.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.640]   In fact, back in seminary I did a whole paper just on this word teleos.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.100]   It's kind of very similar to the word agape.
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.240]   You can do a whole series on the word agape or another word in the New Testament, the
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.140]   word meno, to remain.
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.920]   That's another word that can't be translated with one word.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:48.560]   And so in the Greek, in Colossians chapter 128, it says, "We proclaim him admonishing
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.000]   every man and teaching every man with all wisdom so that they may present every man
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.240]   complete in Christ."
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.560]   And that word is teleos.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.740]   In the NIV, it says to be made perfect in Christ.
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.860]   And in the ESV, it says to be made mature in Christ.
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:11.980]   So the word perfect, teleos, in this passage is not referring to perfect as in reference
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.260]   to not being perfect, not like having some sort of a defect.
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:23.060]   The word perfect has the idea of fulfilling, meaning to bring to conclusion what was started.
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.060]   That's what the word means.
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.820]   And so theologians call this theology here and not yet.
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.420]   God initiated the salvation, justification.
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.220]   We are in the process of sanctification, but ultimately we will get to glorification when
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.220]   he comes.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.460]   But these are not three separate things.
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.620]   These are all one thing that he describes in different ways to help us understand.
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:52.360]   So the word teleos has the idea of reaching its goal, to fulfilling its purpose, to reach
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:09:00.220]   the finish line, to finish the term, and to make something complete and full, that there
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.940]   is nothing more than that.
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.220]   Meaning that everything that God has started here is going to be fulfilled when we are
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.220]   in heaven.
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:16.980]   And as great as that day was when I met Christ, he said it was just the initiation.
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.480]   Every other memory that I have on this earth, and probably that you have, is temporary.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.500]   As great as that memory of meeting my father, it's temporary.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.380]   And it's only for me.
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:31.460]   And as great as it was that the day that I got married, it's only here.
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:36.380]   Whatever memories that you may have, it's temporary because life is temporary.
[00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.660]   But what he initiated with us, he said he's going to teleos.
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.900]   He's going to bring it to completion.
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.340]   And we talked about that last week, how heaven is a place of celebration.
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:52.380]   And he says it, John 15, 11, "These things I have spoken to you so that my joy may be
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:10:00.020]   in you, and that your joy may be made full, complete, teleos."
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:05.460]   What he initiated, this joy, this celebration, we're going to be in heaven celebrating in
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.460]   its fulfillment.
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.180]   John 10, 10, "The thief comes only to steal and to kill and to destroy.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.100]   I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.240]   To the full, it says in the NIV.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.180]   So the purpose of salvation isn't simply to save us from judgment.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:27.180]   He saved us from judgment so that we may have this Zoé and have it eternally and have it
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.300]   to the fullest.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:34.900]   So anything that you and I have experienced on this earth was just the initiation of that.
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:40.360]   And that's why the Bible calls us to taste and see that the Lord is good.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:46.300]   Because if you have tasted his goodness, that taste is what drives us to pursue him further.
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:50.580]   That taste is what causes us to praise him and worship him.
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:58.660]   In Luke 10, 17-20, Jesus sends out the 70 disciples and they come back elated, joyful,
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.700]   happy, because they were able to cast out demons in his name.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:07.780]   Remember, we talked about the power of angels, whether they were fallen angels or whether
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.420]   they're angels worshiping God, serving God.
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.420]   Angels were powerful beings.
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:17.420]   Remember, we talked about how one angel wiped out 185,000 Assyrian soldiers?
[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.300]   That's how powerful they were.
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.220]   So the disciples were aware of that.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:28.180]   In fact, angels were so venerated that some people in the early church started to strain,
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.340]   actually started to worship angels.
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.920]   So they knew how powerful these angels were.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.140]   They were living in fear of these demons.
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.700]   They went out in the name of Jesus and they started casting out demons.
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.860]   And they come back and say, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name."
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.700]   And he said to them, Jesus said to them, "I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning.
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.980]   Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all power
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.300]   and enemy and nothing will injure you."
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:00.500]   Imagine the joy and excitement of hearing that and seeing the kind of power that God
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.220]   has given, Jesus has given them.
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:08.540]   But Jesus says in verse 20, "Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:15.060]   subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven."
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.340]   There are other times it recorded where the disciples were trying to cast out demons and
[00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:23.780]   they couldn't cast out because the demons were too powerful and they come back discouraged.
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:29.100]   The reason, what he is saying here, he's not saying don't rejoice or don't be happy.
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.740]   He said if you're going to place your hope in anything, place your hope in something
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:38.580]   that cannot be taken away, that the Son of God died for you.
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:45.540]   If you're going to rejoice in anything, rejoice over the fact that the Son of God loves you.
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:49.140]   In fact, in Luke chapter 15, verse 10, it says, "In the same way, I tell you, there
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:53.980]   is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:13:02.180]   It says, "Whole heaven rejoices when a sinner repents."
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:11.580]   People ask me, as a church grows, how big do you want the church to get?
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:18.340]   Now, I don't know the motive behind that question because I can't read what they're asking.
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:23.580]   Part of it is because, especially if you came to our church when our church was small, and
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:27.140]   as the church grows, there's an initial excitement of, "Oh, the church is growing, the church
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.140]   is growing."
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.940]   Then it grows to a certain point, it's like, "It's just not the same."
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:37.260]   Some of you guys remember when our church was smaller where you knew every part of my
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.300]   house.
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.460]   You knew every part of my house because we had Wednesday Bible study there, Friday Bible
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:47.500]   study, we had leaders meeting, and we even celebrated New Year's Eve.
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.460]   I'm sure our neighbors didn't like that, but we did everything out of our house.
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:55.620]   We had intimate relationship.
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:01.220]   I remember when our church was young, remember when we would send people off to China?
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:07.980]   We had 120 people, and 120 people would show up at the airport to send people off.
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:12.580]   Our church was known as a loitering church because once we got together, we would never
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.580]   leave.
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:19.380]   Every once in a while, somebody may ask, and again, I'm not saying that that's the reason
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.220]   behind it, but I know sometimes when that question is asked, it's because, "How do
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.580]   we manage this growth?"
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:30.980]   At some point, maybe that's it.
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:35.060]   Whenever they ask me that question, I tell them, "How big do you want the church to
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.060]   get?"
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.500]   They say, "Seven billion.
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.500]   Seven billion.
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.500]   That's my goal.
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.700]   Until then, we're going to keep growing."
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.700]   If the purpose of our church and the reason why we're doing what we're doing is to build
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.460]   our kingdom, even 10 is too big.
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.460]   Five is too big.
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.460]   Even one is too big.
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:59.460]   If our goal is to reach the lost, the Bible says every sinner that comes to Christ, He
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.060]   says, "Heavens rejoice."
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:08.220]   Some of the greatest joys in my life after I became a Christian was seeing sinners come
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.220]   to Christ.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:15.460]   I remember, and this was the second person that I was able to share the gospel that came
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.460]   to Christ.
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.700]   It made such an impact in my life.
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:24.220]   We were up in Seattle, Washington, and this is when I was about sophomore in college.
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.700]   Our Bible study leader took us out.
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.260]   We were downtown Seattle.
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:32.220]   They were trying to share the gospel, but there was this homeless man that stood out
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.860]   to me.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:39.500]   I could tell he had a bit of alcohol in his breath, but he wasn't drunk.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.220]   As I was walking around, I stopped and I tried to share the gospel with him.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.460]   You could tell he's just not having it.
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.980]   I'm like, "Get that trash away from me."
[00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:49.980]   He was angry.
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:51.580]   Then I was kind of curious.
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:56.420]   Normally, I would just kind of walk by and talk to somebody who's more interested, but
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:02.340]   I could tell in his eyes that even as he was angry, that he wanted to engage.
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.140]   I asked him, "Hey, can I ask you a personal question?
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.700]   If you're offended, you don't have to answer me."
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.620]   I said, "What happened?
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.140]   How'd you get out of here?"
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.140]   Then with tears in his eyes, he started to share with me.
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:22.860]   He said he was a middle-class engineer, had a nice house, had a wife that he loved, and
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.740]   had two small children.
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:33.700]   He had a great life, except him and his wife got into this habit of doing drugs.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:39.620]   After work, him and his wife would do drugs, and it just got more severe.
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:44.460]   One day he came home and found his wife overdosed, and she died from that.
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.000]   He loved her, and you could tell he loved her.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.940]   As he's telling me this story, he's weeping.
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.980]   He said, "I just lost all motivation to live."
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.580]   Eventually, he lost his job.
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:02.580]   Because he lost his job, he couldn't pay for his house, and so he lost his home.
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.060]   Because he lost his job, he lost his home.
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.700]   He couldn't pay the bills, so the government came and took the small children away from
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:09.700]   him.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:14.260]   Then he just said, "After that, I just want to die, but I just can't."
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:23.340]   He was out in the street, drowning his sorrows whenever he can.
[00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:26.700]   Obviously I wanted to help him, but I remember that story.
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.140]   Peter and John at the temple, they're begging for money.
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:35.980]   He says, "Silver and gold, I have none, but what I have I give unto you.
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.600]   I don't have any dollars.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.940]   I don't have any coins.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.380]   But can I share with you something that happened to me?"
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:47.700]   I started sharing my testimony, and then I started to share the gospel with him.
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.780]   I went through the whole ... that we all have sinned, fall short of the way, how I was trained
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:52.780]   in college.
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.060]   I came to the end, and he was very attentive.
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:00.900]   I asked him at the end, "Do you want to accept Jesus Christ?"
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.300]   He eagerly said, "Yes."
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.580]   I'm a little bit skeptical.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.020]   By that time, shared the gospel maybe about 100 times, but he's only the second guy who
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.020]   was interested.
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.940]   I said, "Is this guy real or not?
[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:17.940]   Maybe he wants money.
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.340]   Maybe he's just going through the motion."
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.940]   I said, "Let's pray."
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.620]   We were standing there with all these people walking around, and they started staring at
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.060]   us because he saw me engage him.
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:34.220]   When I said, "Let's pray," he grabbed my arms and he got on his knees.
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.220]   He pulled me down with him.
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:40.740]   I said, "This is the middle of downtown, people walking around, and I'm embarrassed, but we're
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.380]   going to pray."
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:47.620]   I led him through the prayer, and as I was leading him through the prayer, I said, "Lord,
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:48.620]   I'm a sinner.
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.620]   I need you.
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:50.620]   I believe in Christ.
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.620]   He died for my sins."
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.420]   I could hear him weeping.
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.580]   After we finished the prayer, he opened his eyes, and I looked at his eyes.
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.060]   He was not the same guy.
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.100]   He was not the same guy.
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.580]   He genuinely repented and accepted Christ.
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.660]   He got up on his feet, and then he said, "Give me your tracts."
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.300]   I had a pocket full of tracts that I was trying to hand out, and he took all of it.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.940]   He said, "I'm going to tell my friends."
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:23.220]   I didn't live in Oregon at that time or Seattle at that time, so our leader said, "Hey, we
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.500]   have to go," so we packed up, and I wasn't able to follow up with him.
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.860]   I remember that experience made such a deep impression in me.
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:34.940]   What could I have possibly given this man to change his situation?
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:40.100]   Even if I was a millionaire, gave him $100,000, couldn't bring his wife back, his children,
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:46.220]   everything that he lost, he just wanted to disappear, but what I did give him was a hope
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:54.180]   in Christ, his sin forgiven, and I could tell he had a new reason to live.
[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:58.580]   So it was at that time I thought to myself, I didn't think about pastoral ministry, but
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.540]   I said, "This is what I want to do the rest of my life.
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.180]   I want to tell people about Jesus Christ.
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.540]   I want to spend the rest of my life and give my full attention to share the gospel to as
[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:13.780]   many people as possible," not simply because it was an obligation, not because the Bible
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.440]   said so, because it brought so much joy.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:24.880]   To see that joy in his heart brought so much joy in my heart.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:32.900]   The Bible says that true celebration is coming, and once we forget that, Christianity becomes
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.100]   such a burden.
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.100]   Things that we need to do.
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.100]   Life is hard enough as it is.
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:42.140]   Those of you who have small children at home, you're huffing and puffing just to make it
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.540]   out of the door in the morning.
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.740]   You come back and you're exhausted and tired.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:52.820]   If your walk with Christ isn't because it produces the greatest joy, on top of all the
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:59.260]   burden of living in this sinful world, you have to appease this God that you cannot appease.
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:03.500]   You have relational problems at church, you have relational problems at home, and you're
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:08.420]   trying to do it, constantly feeling guilty, because that's all Christianity is if you
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:16.340]   don't know the joy that Christ brings.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:20.740]   You know the parables, the three parables in Luke chapter 15?
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:27.060]   Jesus gives the same three parables because he was hanging out with the sinners, the prostitutes
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:31.180]   and the tax collectors and the Pharisees and the scribes became angry because he was gaining
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:35.700]   a lot of popularity and they thought that they needed to be pure.
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:40.740]   We need to keep the law perfectly in order to get God's blessing so that God doesn't
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.900]   condemn us again.
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:48.100]   So here's this Messiah and all these people are coming to him and yet he's hanging around
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.100]   with the sinners.
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.740]   He's going to ruin God's blessing for us.
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:55.820]   So they became angry with him, and in response to that, he tells these three parables.
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:01.260]   The parable of the 99, leaving the 99 and going after the one lost sheep.
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:06.300]   Parable of the one silver coin that's lost and she sweeps the whole house and gets it.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.100]   And then the parable of the prodigal son.
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.500]   And all three parables are really meant to be understood together because it makes the
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.440]   same point.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:20.100]   The first point that he makes with these three parables is that they did not understand the
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.100]   heart of God.
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.620]   They said, "Oh, we need to be pure.
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:24.620]   We need to be holy."
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.340]   And he said, "You don't know the heart of God."
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:28.700]   He would leave the 99.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:33.860]   He's not saying he's going to forsake them, but how every single sheep is precious.
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.900]   Every single soul is precious.
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.100]   So he was reversing the table and he said, "You're saying that we don't know God."
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.720]   And Jesus said, "No, you do not know God.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.040]   This is who God is."
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.500]   He would leave the 99 to go after the one.
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:51.180]   He would leave, like sweep the whole house and get one.
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:55.260]   He's eagerly waiting for the prodigal son to come back.
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:01.960]   If we dissect these parables, there's certain parts of it that really doesn't make a whole
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.760]   lot of sense.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:10.700]   Because the third part of this message, or another universal part of this message, is
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.980]   that once he finds them, he celebrates.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:19.460]   And I was thinking about that, when he comes back with that one sheep and they say, "Hey,
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.460]   I found this one sheep.
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.460]   Let's celebrate."
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.980]   And usually when they celebrate, they slaughter the sheep.
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.020]   They find one coin, they say, "Oh, I found this coin.
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.740]   Let's spend the other ones to celebrate."
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.740]   But the point of that is not about the coin.
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.320]   The point of that is not about the sheep.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:40.720]   The point of it is how it is precious, how every single one of these things are precious.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.300]   And that's the point that he was trying to make.
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.020]   You've forgotten your calling.
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:49.500]   The only reason why the nation of Israel was called is so that he would bless them and
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.700]   that through them, bless the world.
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.640]   So that the sinners may come to him.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:02.260]   But you've used your blessing to get on a pedestal and look down at everybody else.
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:07.180]   So his point was, you do not know the heart of God.
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:13.300]   God celebrates the salvation of each sinner when they repent.
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:24.100]   And if you look at the prodigal son's message, he says in verse 15, the prodigal son wasn't
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:28.300]   able or wasn't willing to wait until the father died because he was not the first son and
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.180]   he wanted my possession.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.580]   He takes it and we know the story.
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:34.780]   He goes back and he just blows it.
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.340]   Look, look at the way it's described.
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.900]   So when he went and hired himself out to the one of the citizens of the country and he
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.340]   sent him into the fields to feed what?
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.340]   Swine.
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.340]   Right?
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.340]   Who is this?
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.340]   What is a swine?
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.340]   Right?
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.340]   It's a dirty animal.
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.340]   And who is this man?
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.660]   He's a Jew.
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:59.460]   He grew up in a faithful Jewish home and for him to work to feed swine is the lowest job
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.580]   that he can have.
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:07.660]   And Jesus is telling this story on purpose to demonstrate just how far he fell.
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:12.380]   And then the very next page, verse it says in verse 16, and he would have gladly filled
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:17.860]   his stomach with the pods that the swine were eating and no one was giving anything to him.
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:21.140]   Not only was he feeding the swine, he fell so far.
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:26.480]   He said he was willing to eat what they eat.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.960]   That would have been so sacrilegious for a Jewish man.
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.580]   But that's the point that Jesus is trying to make.
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:33.580]   That's how desperate he became.
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:38.780]   And it wasn't until he became that desperate he realized what he did.
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:43.980]   And he says in the next verse, but when he came to his senses, he said, how many of my
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:50.300]   father's hired men have more than enough bread, but I am dying here with hunger.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:54.100]   I will get up and go to my father and will say to him, father, I have sinned against
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.680]   heaven and in your sight I am no longer worthy to be called your son.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.340]   Take me as one of your hired men.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:05.820]   He was so filled with pride when he demanded to have his possession and left, but it wasn't
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:10.680]   until he fell flat on his face and he was so hungry, he was willing to eat swine food,
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.180]   he realized what he had with his father.
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:16.820]   And this was him repenting.
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:24.660]   I remember when I first became a Christian, I was so excited about my faith.
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:29.600]   I didn't know much about the Bible, even though I grew up in a pastor's home.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.960]   I didn't know much about the Bible.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.820]   We moved around so much, but I was just so eager to tell people about God.
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:41.260]   And I remember in my mind thinking that I'm going to preach to as many people as possible.
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.240]   I'm going to see revival.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.800]   And I've always wanted to be in the military.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.540]   And I fantasized about that.
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.540]   I wasn't going to be a general.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.340]   I was going to be a general in the kingdom of God.
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:55.040]   I remember thinking that as a young Christian.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:00.900]   And then, just like many young Christians, reality set in.
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.720]   My flesh didn't disappear.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.340]   I started struggling with the same things.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.620]   Started getting into fights.
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.060]   I was still disappointing my parents.
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:16.320]   Purity, it didn't just disappear.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:22.160]   And so every Friday, we had a prayer meeting in LA, and every Friday I was praying for
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.560]   forgiveness.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.560]   Every Friday.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:31.320]   In fact, I prayed so much for forgiveness, I was crying out to every Friday, just, "God,
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.320]   forgive me."
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.200]   And I would sit on Monday, and I would wait until Friday so that I can repent and get
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.200]   restored.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.680]   And this was a cycle over and over.
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.920]   And I didn't realize just how loud I was when I was praying.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.000]   One of our Bible study leaders pulled me aside and said, "Peter, we can't pray when you pray."
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.600]   I was so hurt by that, because I'm praying to God, and he's telling me, "This guy's
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.520]   leading me Bible study, he's telling me to stop praying."
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:58.840]   I must have been really loud, because every Friday I was pounding, "God, forgive me.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.840]   God, forgive me."
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.280]   And then it got to a point where I got tired.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.680]   I got tired of repenting.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.040]   I got disappointed in myself.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.960]   And it wasn't because of a temptation in the world.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.960]   It wasn't because of some discouragement.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:16.400]   It was just, "How can I go to God again?"
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.800]   And so for about a year and a half, I fell away from my faith.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:25.880]   I just kind of let myself be, and I started getting into things that I didn't get into
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.200]   even before I became a Christian.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.880]   Because I became a Christian when I was 16.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.680]   When I backslid, I was about 18 years old.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:38.800]   And so my friends that I didn't talk to for a while, they started driving, have money.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.180]   And so we got into things that I didn't get into even before I was a Christian.
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:47.840]   So I remember this one particular night, about a year and a half of just doing this, that
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.840]   we got wasted.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:53.920]   I'm not going to get into the details, but we got wasted.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.320]   And we barely made it home.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:00.780]   He dropped me off at my parents' apartment, got home about 3.30 in the morning.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:06.500]   And I was sitting in the living room in the middle of the night in my parents' apartment,
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:10.080]   and I was just talking to myself, "Is this fun?
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.080]   Is this fun?"
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:15.800]   And I was like, "This is so stupid."
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.400]   Maybe before I was a Christian, I could have enjoyed this, but as a Christian, in the back
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.620]   of my mind, this is not right.
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.620]   I don't want this.
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.620]   I'm not even having fun.
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:24.980]   This is dumb.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:32.060]   And I remember half drunk, sitting in that room thinking, "I'd rather sit in the back
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.060]   of the seat."
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.060]   Forget this revival.
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.060]   I'm going to be used by God.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:38.540]   It's like all that went out the door.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:46.380]   I'd rather sit quietly in the back, even if it's just an inch of progress a year.
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.000]   That's better than this.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.500]   And so it was much different.
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:55.420]   My first repentance was like, "Oh my gosh, I can't believe God is real and He loves me,
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.100]   and I'm going to tell the whole world about God."
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.300]   And that was my first conversion.
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:06.100]   But the second time I repented, it was just, "My Father's house as a servant is better
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.100]   than this."
[00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:14.940]   See, it says in Luke chapter 15, "When the Son came," verse 21, "the Son said to Him,
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.980]   'Father, I have sinned against heaven and in Your sight.
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.700]   I am no longer worthy to be called Your Son.'"
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:30.380]   But He was expecting His Father to come out and He said, "You, after what you've done,
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:36.700]   everything you blew, the disgrace that you brought to our home," He says, "But the Father
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:42.780]   said to His slaves, 'Quickly, bring out the best robe, put it on Him, put a ring on His
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:48.380]   hand and sandals on His feet, and bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let us eat and
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.380]   celebrate.
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.640]   For this Son of Mine was dead and has come to life again.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.500]   He was lost and has been found.'
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.540]   And they began to celebrate."
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:06.160]   He was trying to tell the Pharisees and the scribes, "This is your Heavenly Father.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.260]   What you think Heavenly Father is, you've missed Him.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:16.340]   This is the Heavenly Father who is eagerly waiting for sinners to repent and come.
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:21.880]   But not only He will celebrate, that they're going to be celebrating for eternity in Zion.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.140]   This is who God is."
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:33.700]   See, all that you and I have experienced, all the joy that you and I have known as Christians,
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.420]   we're really meant to be hors d'oeuvres.
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.340]   You go to a wedding and they'll present the hors d'oeuvres.
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:43.940]   You don't go to the hors d'oeuvres and then go home.
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.100]   You get the hors d'oeuvres because it kind of whets your appetite and prepares.
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:52.860]   So you go to some places and the hors d'oeuvres are ridiculous.
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:53.860]   And you come and say, "Oh my gosh."
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:58.340]   In fact, some of the people at church have pictures of me standing by the door waiting
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:00.980]   for hors d'oeuvres.
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:04.140]   You got to stand in the right place because when they come out, the hors d'oeuvres that
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:09.380]   aren't that popular will make its way around, but the good ones don't make it past 10,
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.500]   15 feet.
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.620]   Jason knows what I'm talking about.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:19.420]   I have a picture of me and him standing by the door.
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:24.740]   Because the hors d'oeuvres are to prepare us, and if the hors d'oeuvres are this good,
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.580]   what's inside?
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.340]   What's inside?
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.500]   That's what this means, the here and not yet.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.740]   That's what the word teleos means, is to be made whole, to bring to completion.
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:42.980]   That everything that he has shown us, everything he has taught us, is just to whet our appetite.
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:48.740]   So he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion, until the day of Christ
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.740]   when he comes.
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:54.060]   He will bring to teleos what he has intended.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:59.860]   In 1 Corinthians 13, 9-12 it says, "For we know in part, and we prophesy in part, but
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:03.660]   when the perfect comes, teleos comes, the partial will be done away with."
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.720]   When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child, reason like a child.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.220]   When I became a man, I did away with childless things.
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:13.500]   For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face.
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:20.380]   Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, just as I also have been fully known.
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:28.860]   I can't describe to you with words the day that I became a Christian.
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:32.020]   Some of you are probably sick and tired of me sharing my testimony, because you've heard
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.300]   it over a hundred times.
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:41.180]   I can tell it to you another hundred times.
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.360]   It was the happiest day of my life.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:48.260]   An angry child became happy instantaneously.
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.460]   Instantaneously.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:54.300]   I didn't have to get counseling, I didn't have to get discipled.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:59.020]   I met Christ and everything changed.
[00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:00.940]   Everything changed.
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:08.220]   And to think, those were just hors d'oeuvres.
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:14.100]   That when we get to heaven, this God who opened my eyes to see Him, I'm going to be in front
[00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.540]   of Him face to face.
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:22.700]   And it's not going to be temporary, it's going to be forever.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:30.100]   That's why Jesus says He went to the cross because of the joy set before Him.
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:34.780]   Not because He was obligated, not because somebody was twisting His arms.
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:39.220]   Because of the joy set before Him, He was able to endure the cross.
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:46.780]   The moment we take our eyes off of what's coming, it just becomes the cross.
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.100]   It just becomes suffering.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.460]   It just becomes obligation.
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.100]   It isn't until we have firmly placed our hope in Christ.
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:01.260]   That's what it says in Philippians 3, 12-15, "Not that I have already obtained it or have
[00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:06.500]   already become perfect, but I press on so that I may lay hold of that for which also
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.500]   He laid hold of me."
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:16.300]   He says He's pressing on because He wants what God has already given Him, but He hasn't
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.620]   reached it yet.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.100]   He hasn't been made perfect yet.
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:24.340]   In 1 John 3, 2-3, it says, "Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.700]   as yet what we will be.
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:31.260]   We know that when He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is.
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:36.980]   And everyone who has this hope fixed on Him purifies himself just as He is pure."
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:40.260]   He just described sanctification.
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.020]   Sanctification isn't just hard work.
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.020]   It isn't the right program.
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:44.020]   It isn't the right organization.
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:46.060]   It isn't meeting the right person.
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:51.300]   He says sanctification is the individual who recognizes this hope in Christ.
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:36:00.420]   And he who hopes in this Christ, he purifies himself just as Jesus said, "He endured the
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.900]   cross because of the joy set before Him."
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:11.180]   If we believe that true joy is coming to Christ, true life is coming to Christ, and that's
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:18.980]   why anything that gets in the way of tainting that, we don't want anything to do with.
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:25.260]   That's sanctification, not just hard work, not just right organization, not just right
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.060]   program.
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:30.100]   Do we believe this?
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.100]   Do we believe this?
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:38.820]   He who believes it, sets his hope on Him, will purify himself as He is pure.
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:44.620]   You know, some of you guys probably have different bucket lists, right?
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:45.900]   And I know some of you guys love to travel.
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:49.140]   I like traveling, but some of you guys are really like traveling.
[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.820]   And every once in a while, I ask you like, "Hey, can you tell me if we go here what to
[00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:53.820]   do?"
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:58.300]   And then the itinerary you give, 7 o'clock wake up, 7 o'clock brush your teeth, 7 o'clock
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.540]   get breakfast, 7 o'clock get coffee.
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.460]   It's just, I don't want to go to this vacation.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:06.460]   I'm tired looking at this itinerary.
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:07.460]   That's a vacation.
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.100]   You're supposed to go there and relax.
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:14.500]   I'll wake up when I feel like waking up, and then if I'm hungry, I'm going to eat.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.100]   And then if I'm bored, I'm going to go see something.
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.140]   And then when I'm tired, I'm going to come home.
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:22.420]   This is worse than the job.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:28.140]   But because you love it, you love traveling to the point where you want to go maximize
[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:31.480]   the time that you have when you get there.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:36.780]   And you pour so much energy to maximize it, right?
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.100]   Why?
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.980]   Because it makes you happy to do that.
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:47.500]   You put time and effort and energy and money because it brings joy.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:54.780]   If we recognize the things that God has given us in eternity is so much more than anything
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:38:00.900]   else that we can experience here, how much more energy and time and effort should we
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:05.940]   be pouring into pursuing that?
[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:09.660]   Let me close with this, Isaiah 25, 6 through 8.
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:15.660]   The Lord of hosts will prepare a lavish banquet for all peoples on this mountain, a banquet
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:21.060]   of aged wine, choice pieces with marrow and refined aged wine.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:25.820]   And on this mountain, he will swallow up the covering which is over all peoples, even the
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:27.500]   veil which is stretched over all nations.
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:32.340]   He will swallow up death for all time, and the Lord God will wipe tears away from all
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:38.940]   faces and he will remove the reproach of his people from all the earth for the Lord has
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:39.940]   spoken.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:40.940]   Amen.
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:48.820]   I pray that the promise of Zion will be so deeply embedded in us that what he started
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:54.780]   in us now will cause us to long for the day, right?
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:59.100]   Long for the day that we would also eagerly wait and be purified as a result.
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:03.740]   Let's pray together.
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:10.220]   Lord, what an awesome God you are.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:13.100]   Lord, you know our weakness.
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:18.240]   You know how easily we get entangled and tempted by the things that are temporal.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:24.980]   We know, Father God, in our minds that all of these things are passing away.
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:28.820]   And yet we are constantly concerned, worried.
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.660]   Help us, Lord God.
[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:33.380]   We're helpless when we are away from you.
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:38.160]   I pray that your word and your spirit would lead us, guide us, help us, Lord God, to know
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:42.460]   that true joy, true celebration is coming with Christ.
[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:48.640]   That though our life is now hidden with Christ, help us, Lord God, to wait for him coming
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.180]   and when he is glorified, that we will be glorified in him.
[00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.180]   May your name be honored.
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.180]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:54.180]   Amen.
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.140]   Amen.
