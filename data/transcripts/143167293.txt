[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.960]   Alright, let's take a look at 1 Corinthians 11, verses 2-16.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:23.400]   So if you would open your Bibles there, 1 Corinthians 11, verses 2-16.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.360]   Before I read, you know, you guys had a chance to talk a little bit about the content of
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.360]   the passage.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.640]   I want to remind us that we've been working through the book of Corinthians now for what
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.520]   I believe to be something close to six months.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.400]   And really in my mind, the book of 1 Corinthians is a wisdom book.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.800]   In my mind, it's Apostle Paul teaching the church, this is how you ought to think.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.720]   This is how you ought to judge.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.760]   This is how you should discern and come to a conclusion.
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.800]   And so remember that chapter 8-10 that we studied for a big section, it was about how
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.480]   to make decisions when you have the liberty but it affects your brothers and sisters in
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.480]   Christ.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.480]   Right?
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.080]   Well today, we're jumping into a completely different category of thought, right?
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.400]   And in my mind, nonetheless, it's still under the category of how to wisely behave in the
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.600]   church.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.480]   How to wisely think about even, maybe it was current event issues for them, you know?
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.160]   How to think about those things.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.560]   So let's jump into the passage and then we'll take a moment to pray and study.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.640]   It says in verse 2, "Now I praise you because you remember me in everything and hold firmly
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.800]   to the traditions just as I delivered them to you.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.360]   But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man and the man is the head
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.120]   of a woman and God is the head of Christ.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.160]   Every man who has something on his head while praying or prophesying disgraces his head.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.680]   But every woman who has her head uncovered while praying or prophesying disgraces her
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.440]   head for she is one and the same as the woman whose head is shaved.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.840]   For if a woman does not cover her head, let her also shave her hair, have her hair cut
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.640]   off, but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved,
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.200]   let her cover her head.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.880]   For a man ought not to have his head covered since he is the image and the glory of God,
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.960]   but the woman is the glory of man.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.200]   For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.120]   For indeed man was not created for the woman's sake, but woman for the man's sake.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.080]   Therefore the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head because of the angels.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.880]   However, in the Lord neither is woman independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.080]   For as the woman originates from the man, so also the man has his birth through the
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.120]   woman and all things originate from God.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.720]   Judge for yourselves, is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.080]   Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.080]   him?
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.560]   But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.160]   For her hair is given to her for a covering, but if one is inclined to be contentious,
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.600]   we have no other practice, nor have the churches of God.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.600]   Okay?
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.600]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.120]   Father God, we thank you for your word.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.200]   We thank you for the reading of your truth.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:36.720]   And God, I pray that definitely your truth many times stands in opposition to the ideology
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.760]   of the world at hand.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.800]   And I pray, Father God, that we would be very discerning on God, that we would not be sloppy
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.120]   with the truth, but first that we would understand.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:54.160]   And God, that we would be able to uphold it, affirm it, not only that, but have it be confirmed
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.800]   by the way that we approach our lives.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.760]   Father, we want to thank you again for guiding us in your truth.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.560]   I pray for every single one of us that meeting here tonight, joining together with the church,
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.160]   and looking at your word would be a fruitful time of communion with you.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.160]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.160]   Amen.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.160]   Okay.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.960]   So we're looking at this verse, and I want to start off by looking at verse two.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.960]   It says here, "Now I praise you because you remember me in everything and hold firmly
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.200]   to the traditions just as I deliver them to you."
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   Is he being sarcastic?
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.360]   I asked you the question of, "Hey, this church is full of problems."
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.360]   So what is he intending to say when he says this in verse two?
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.320]   What were just some of your answers that you guys said?
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.000]   Maybe from the gentleman's table on my left.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.440]   What were some of the answers to that first question about the church has a lot of problems,
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.960]   what is Apostle Paul saying?
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:12.080]   He was sort of implying that despite all the problems, at least they were doing the traditions.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.080]   Okay.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.080]   Cool.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.600]   Any other, what other thoughts did you guys have about that verse?
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   About the table in that corner?
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   He said that some of the problems that were discussed in the previous chapters were just
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:06:00.520]   about food, that they like, they both thought that, "Oh, it's okay for the Lord to do that
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.520]   by His will, it's not okay."
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.520]   It was despite that, it was an effort to like follow the path.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.520]   Okay.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.520]   Cool.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.520]   Good.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.520]   So kind of combining the two, I feel the reason why I asked is because remember I mentioned
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.720]   that the church probably had multiple correspondence with Apostle Paul, letters going back and
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.560]   forth, and clearly they were asking him questions.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.360]   I think Apostle Paul is thankful for the fact that like, "Hey, at least you're asking me."
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.480]   And they're asking him questions about, "What do we do about the food?"
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.400]   They're obviously asking questions about, "What do you do about this?"
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.080]   Maybe perhaps there were a group of ladies who are starting to take a more prominent
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.980]   role in the church.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.200]   Maybe there were ladies who were advocating like, "Hey, I want to be able to do what that
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.200]   guy is doing."
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.200]   Right?
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.200]   Nonetheless, they were trying their best to basically seek advice from Apostle Paul.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.280]   And he says, "Thank you for remembering me."
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.800]   And he talks about the traditions.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.360]   And the reason why I bring that up is because that's important to our topic of study, the
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.360]   traditions.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.360]   Okay.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.280]   And I want to ask you this question, when are traditions bad and when are traditions
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.280]   good?
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.440]   If Apostle Paul lays down perhaps certain traditions, like, "Hey, year to year, I want
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.360]   you to do this."
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.680]   When does that kind of tradition become good and when does that kind of tradition become
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.680]   bad?
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.680]   Any thoughts?
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:32.320]   Are you referring to having to practice them as you have to do it?
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.800]   I guess I can be a little bit more detailed with the question.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.840]   So I was trying to study what he meant by traditions.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.320]   And what's interesting is he literally just means like traditions, a pattern that the
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.720]   group keeps.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.720]   Okay.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:56.020]   So for our church, we have certain traditions, we have certain like practices that we keep.
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:02.680]   For example, even the idea of membership, is that explicitly spelled out in the Bible?
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.000]   It's not.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.240]   Is it contained in the scriptures?
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.040]   Yes, we believe it is.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:12.840]   But it's something that we practice really, how's the word, carefully and seriously.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.960]   And it's a weighty thing for us at our church.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.960]   Okay.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.800]   So when does something like that become bad versus good?
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:28.560]   I guess my main question is, is all like tradition by men bad?
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.560]   Any thoughts?
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.560]   Yes, Grace.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:38.320]   When you don't understand the purpose of the tradition and you do it just to do it.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.320]   Gotcha.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.320]   Good.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.600]   It definitely becomes bad when a man-made tradition starts to lose its significance.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.000]   Right?
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.540]   Because in my mind, traditions are not bad in and of itself at all.
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:57.880]   As a matter of fact, I like to actually begin traditions with my family.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.800]   I like the fact that various churches have certain traditions.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.200]   You know why?
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.160]   Because I see certain traditions as applications.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.920]   Okay?
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:13.280]   But then if you lose the principle behind the application, then it's like, what in the
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.280]   world are we doing?
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.280]   Right?
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.280]   It's like, why?
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.000]   What's the point?
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.800]   And as soon as you lose the significance, whether it's what it symbolizes or whether
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   it's what it represents for us or whether the overarching motivation that was pushing
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.080]   that application and tradition, if that's lost, then now it's just like, okay, we're
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.080]   just jumping through hoops and we're just putting on drama.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.080]   You know what I mean?
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.080]   That's how it's going to be.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:43.800]   And the reason why I bring that up is because today I really want to talk about the principle
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.760]   of gender roles, not so much the tradition of gender roles.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.080]   Okay?
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.720]   The principle of gender roles as opposed to the tradition of gender roles.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.760]   And I think Apostle Paul makes the distinction.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.240]   What do I mean by that?
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.600]   Verse three.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.120]   Here is the principle.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.880]   Can I have, since you're looking right at me, Titus, can you read verse three?
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:12.760]   But I want you to understand that every man is Christ.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.640]   The head of a wife is her husband and the head of Christ is God.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.640]   Okay, cool.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.400]   So Apostle Paul begins by saying, hey, I'm glad you're referring to me.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.200]   I want to answer your questions kind of thing.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.080]   I'm glad that you're trying your best to keep the teachings I gave to you.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.360]   But I want you to understand this principle behind why I gave all that stuff.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:38.640]   And the principle is there is this relationship that's going on and I gave you a easy question
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.840]   about, hey, what are the relationships?
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.200]   How are they connected?
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:48.160]   It's Christ to every man, man to his wife, and then God to Christ.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.160]   Right?
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.720]   And the connecting idea is headship.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.320]   You have Christ as head over man, man head over woman, and God head over Christ.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.320]   Okay?
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.960]   But I want to ask you this question.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:06.320]   You know, can some of you guys perhaps try to fill in that big bucket?
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.480]   Talking about the headship of a man or the headship of Christ is a huge bucket, right?
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:15.120]   So let's actually first talk about Christ.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.480]   And it says here that Christ is the head of every man.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:22.120]   What kind of thoughts come into the idea of headship?
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.000]   What is referred to when you say, hey, Christ is the head of every man?
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.520]   Lordship.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.880]   Okay.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.040]   What else?
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.880]   Authority.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.880]   You guys can jot these all down.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.880]   These are good.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.880]   Lordship and authority.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.880]   What else?
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.880]   Sorry?
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:49.920]   Oh, as in like the other party submits to the head.
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.920]   Okay.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.920]   Good.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:12:02.080]   So, I asked you guys to kind of see if you can jog any memories of other verses.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.080]   There's a bunch.
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.880]   You'd be surprised how many New Testament passages talk about Christ being the head.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.520]   And you guys hit a lot of those.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.320]   So for example, in the book of Ephesians, it talks about this lordship of Christ.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.880]   And so it says everything is subject under his foot.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:23.880]   And you'll think about that scenario or the analogy, and he's talking about king.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:30.120]   And I think I remember when I preached through Ephesians, I said there was a tradition in
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:35.320]   ancient days when essentially, literally, other nations and other rulers, if you conquered
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:40.120]   over them, they would have the king sit on essentially a platform like this, like a stage,
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.840]   you know, and their throne would be on top and the others would literally come by his
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.840]   foot.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.200]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.160]   To show the kind of authority over the other people who've been conquered.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.240]   It's like, whoa, okay.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:59.840]   The other things is, for example, in Ephesians chapter four, to be head, he is the source.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.600]   So he says he is the head and every other piece, that's 415.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.080]   Ephesians 415.
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.600]   Every other piece is joined together by the provision of Christ.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.760]   So Christ in being head, he's kind of the provider.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.600]   He's the sustaining power, okay?
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.360]   And there's just a lot of different thoughts.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:28.400]   Now there's gotta be this question, is Christ's headship over every man the same as man's
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.080]   christship over a woman?
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:38.320]   That's a big question because I just said Christ was like on the throne and then he
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.000]   was like at the feet.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:48.520]   Is Christ's headship over a man the same as a man's christship over a woman?
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.920]   No.
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.920]   No okay, and then why?
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:14:13.040]   Right, okay, good.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:18.920]   So thank you for saying that because I struggle with that quite a bit.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:25.000]   How to teach this idea of authority and the way that an individual has headship over,
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   right?
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.480]   Well, if you turn your Bibles to Ephesians chapter five, this is the classic passage
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.360]   John, husband love your wives.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:38.920]   That's Christ love the church, okay?
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:51.360]   Alright, so what I'd like to do is this is, it says here, and starting from verse 22,
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.360]   okay?
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:59.200]   Or starting from verse 21, it talks about various relationships and then verse 21 says,
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.720]   and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.840]   Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord, for the husband is the head of
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.800]   the wife as Christ also is the head of the church.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:16.240]   He himself being the savior of the body, but as a church is subject to Christ, so also
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:21.600]   the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.760]   Husbands love your wives just as Christ also loved the church and gave himself up for her
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.560]   so that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of the water with the word
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.680]   that he might present to himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkles
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:41.680]   or any such thing but that she would be holy and blameless, okay?
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:49.840]   So in that passage, it tries to make pretty clear the connection, okay?
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:57.560]   But in harmonizing those various passages, we realize, hey, a headship has with it not
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:02.520]   just a simplistic, okay, if you are a head, you're just absolutely ruler.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:09.880]   From that passage alone, we realize headship has quite the array within its definition,
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.000]   right?
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.280]   So I want to challenge us to think about that.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.720]   I want to challenge you guys.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.800]   Study that a little bit because on your own time, because that's an important concept.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.040]   It's going to affect your relationship.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.040]   It's going to affect how you teach various passages or think about various passages of
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.040]   scripture.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:34.080]   In harmonizing the two, I would also agree, there is a direct correlation of modeling
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.160]   and source.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:44.880]   But our authority as perhaps men over a wife or whatnot is a delegated authority, okay?
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.640]   But nonetheless, nonetheless, it's still just as profound.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:54.600]   And I want to give my take on what headship means just for the sake of talking about it,
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.600]   okay?
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.120]   We noticed that there was lordship, there was authority, there was a provision, there
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.120]   was protection.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:06.320]   In the passage that we read just in Ephesians, there was love, okay?
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:11.880]   There was sanctifying and the cause of growth of a wife, all that kind of stuff.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:18.400]   For me, when I think about headship as a man, okay, again, not exactly one-to-one with Christ,
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.240]   but as a man, I think about responsibility, okay?
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.920]   I think about responsibility.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:32.520]   And when I, you know, sometimes I sit and I counsel younger ladies like, "Hey, what
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.520]   kind of guy do you look for?"
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.040]   And they'll say, "I want a leader and I want this and I want that."
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.360]   I said, "Great.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.560]   What do you envision as a leader?"
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.960]   I said, "Well, he's got to be hardworking, not lazy.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.960]   He's got to know what he's doing and he's got to be able to have the strength to push
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.960]   it forward."
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.960]   You know?
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:52.460]   I'm kind of like, "Yeah, but I know some ladies who have husbands like that, but they're
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:53.460]   pretty miserable."
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.440]   And they're like, "What?"
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:01.240]   I'm like, "Because leadership in that scenario is CEO.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.240]   I know where I'm going.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.240]   I know the goal.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.240]   I know the result.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.240]   Let's do it."
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.240]   You know?
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.240]   And then they motivate you to go do it.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.840]   And that's CEO, right?
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.480]   That's CEO.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.880]   Are those aspects necessary as a man to be a leader?
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.100]   Some of those are very necessary, right?
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.760]   But is that what leadership entails?
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.760]   No.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.800]   That's not what leadership, all of it, entails.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:28.420]   In my mind, sometimes, actually, I can give guys slack in the sense that, yeah, sometimes
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.380]   they're trying to decide.
[00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.160]   They're trying to decide what to do.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:37.140]   They're trying to lead others and convince them that they need to go that way.
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.140]   You know?
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:41.180]   They're trying to have strength when perhaps they're timid and weak.
[00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:45.640]   But the guys that I really like to see as the guys who said, like, as soon as they saw
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:53.680]   the need to make a decision, as soon as they saw a need to motivate, they felt the responsibility.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.280]   As soon as they saw a woman that they started to like, it wasn't like, "I like her.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.280]   Come here.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.280]   I want you."
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:05.520]   It was, "I want to take responsibility over her so that her well-being is my responsibility.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.280]   Her faith is my responsibility."
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.880]   That to me is a hard attitude of, like, "I want to take in."
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.880]   Right?
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:19.880]   And to me, whenever you see the word "headship" of Christ, immediately it talks about, and
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.440]   then the fullness of the body.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:27.200]   And so for me, that's the way I think about headship for a man, is this guy is absolutely
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.240]   responsible over that individual.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.120]   That's a guy who I think would be a good leader.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.160]   Yeah, he might struggle with making a decision.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.160]   He might be one of those guys who sits there and deliberates, but he is going to kill himself
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.920]   to try to do it because he feels the responsibility.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.360]   Does that make sense?
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.440]   So, free tip to all you ladies who are single.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.840]   Find the guy who feels the weight of responsibility on his shoulders.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.840]   Okay?
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.840]   All right.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:57.600]   So now, in thinking about that, so he says very clearly, here's the principle, all right?
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:04.360]   There exists a dynamic relationship to which headship can occur, and this headship includes
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.840]   a lot of concepts like authority and responsibility and all that kind of stuff.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:11.640]   And he says, "God over Christ, Christ over man, and man over woman."
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.080]   This is the principle.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.640]   This is God's design.
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.880]   Okay?
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.480]   And then, what you see is the tradition.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:27.440]   What you see is the application of that principle, of the principle of authority and submission
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.640]   in verses four through six.
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.640]   Okay?
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.440]   And so, if I could have, Jeremy, can you read that one, verses four through six, paragraph?
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.840]   Yes.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:43.600]   Every man who has something on his head while praying or prophesying disgraces his head.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:48.320]   But every woman who has her head uncovered while praying or prophesying disgraces her
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.320]   head.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.320]   For she is one and the same as the woman whose head is shaved.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:21:00.040]   For if a woman does not cover her head, let her also have her hair cut off.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.560]   But if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, let her
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.560]   cover her head.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.560]   Okay.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.560]   Thank you.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.360]   So, in looking at this, I've got a couple sub-bullet points, because it's kind of important
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.240]   to study the background a little bit.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.240]   Okay?
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:22.120]   Do you guys remember, I don't know if you guys are, I don't know if I actually covered
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.120]   it.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.120]   Wow.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.680]   Okay, way back in the first class.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.680]   Okay?
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:32.720]   Corinth is located, if you can think of like, you know the Panama Canal south of here?
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.440]   Those points of canals are really important for trade and all that kind of stuff.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.960]   Corinth was right near one of those, and then it's really close to Athens, really close
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960]   to Acropolis.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:47.360]   So, very close to the major trade route of Greece.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.360]   Okay?
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:52.160]   The culture of that time is very different from the Jews.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.280]   The Jews actually meant for a lot of covering.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.280]   Okay?
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.920]   And a lot of the Jews, you know how Moses veiled his face coming down from the mountain?
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.400]   So the Jews actually, for the guys, they covered their face, thinking that was the right thing
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.400]   to do.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:12.800]   Well, in that culture, in the kind of Greek and Roman influenced cultures, the ladies
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   had covering.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.800]   Okay?
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.080]   And the thing about it is, he's saying essentially, it's ridiculous.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:25.200]   In your culture, in your custom, it's ridiculous for a man to have his head covered.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.680]   And that would be disgraceful.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.440]   All right?
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:35.160]   And so, I guess to put it into a modern day thing, it'd be like, this Sunday I'm preaching.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:39.600]   And what if I got onto the pulpit with a dress?
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.800]   Right?
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.960]   Right off the bat, people would have problems.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.480]   And then I could be like, it's just a dress.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.720]   Do you know what Jesus wore?
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.920]   It was like a long thing.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.880]   It wasn't pants, you know?
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.080]   You could almost call it a dress.
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.480]   And then someone would be like, yeah, but it's not right.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:02.120]   And I could argue and be like, well, in the end, what's your criteria?
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.360]   How come guys can't be more free?
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.120]   And then the ladies would be like, no, because that's what girls do.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.120]   That's our custom.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.360]   Likewise, he's talking about custom.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:17.400]   Like, in your culture, if a man were to do this, then it'd be disgraceful.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.600]   So these are very like relative terms, right?
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:25.400]   It's not easy to just cut a line, but like, okay, if you wear this, like a Jewish hat,
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.520]   then it's super disgraceful.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.760]   It's cultural.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:32.360]   So he acknowledges the culture and says, the custom of their time, and says, women typically
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.000]   wear head coverings and men do not.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.640]   As a matter of fact, if you Google on your phones or whatever, Greek veil, you're going
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:45.640]   to see a bunch of veil and you're going to see a bunch of wedding veils and stuff because
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:52.600]   our current model of marriage comes from rich Greek people back in the way day.
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:57.200]   It's the same, a lot of the same customs and the veil and the white gowns, all that kind
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.600]   of stuff, it's from then.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.600]   Okay.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:05.320]   So you see these veils that the ladies wore and the veils were covering that a lot of
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.720]   people wore.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.720]   Married ladies would wear veils and sometimes their veils would be bigger because they had
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.600]   this kind of mentality of like their beauty and their presence is reserved for their husband
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:21.040]   kind of thing, which again, we can look at that culture and be like, dang, that was super
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.040]   conservative.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.280]   But you look at their rationale and it's like, hmm, that's how they applied.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.280]   Okay.
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.280]   So anyway, all that to say is it was very common.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:34.560]   It was something that distinguished between the ladies and the guys and Apostle Paul acknowledges
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.560]   it.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.080]   But we have to ask the question, but what's the big deal?
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.080]   Okay.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.000]   Aren't they Christian?
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.900]   Aren't they free from the regulations of pagan world, of the pagan world?
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:48.900]   What's the big deal?
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.960]   I want to ask you that question.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:57.400]   From your reading from verses two through 16, what is the big deal that Apostle Paul
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:02.720]   saying like this custom that you have in your culture, you know, you can't just like
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.480]   undo it right now.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.480]   Why?
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:09.940]   Women can't just, you know, uncover herself and then come into the worship service and
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.440]   just do all this stuff.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.440]   Why?
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.240]   What's the big deal with this covering?
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.360]   Okay.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.480]   It can be distracting, but why is it distracting?
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:44.840]   I guess from the passage that we're studying today, are there any clues as to why he thinks
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.840]   it's a big deal?
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.440]   Okay, good.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.840]   Because of what it represents.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:01.960]   So in verse 10, if you look in verse 10, it says, therefore the woman ought to have a
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:07.000]   symbol of authority on her head because of the angels.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.360]   So essentially what he's saying, that first part's the key.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:15.200]   The woman, what he wants is the woman has to have a symbol of authority on her head.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.200]   Okay.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:21.160]   Now the reason why a symbol is italicized in your Bible is because those words aren't
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.800]   actually in the Greek.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:28.560]   The way it reads in the Greek is she ought to have authority on her head.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.880]   Okay.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.880]   But it's implied.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:35.600]   She's got to have the representation of authority because that's what it was back then.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:42.640]   If there was a group, there was a group, I guess in every like major, I guess, how would
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.640]   you call it?
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:50.320]   Nation, era, empire, you know, Assyrians even, there were movements of liberalism and there
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.400]   were movements of feminism.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.640]   And sometimes the way that the ladies would look is they would have their head shaved.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.320]   And that's why in the verse he says, essentially, if she's going to uncover her hair, then let
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.680]   her just shave her head.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:08.240]   To have a woman who had her head shaved was either a woman who was caught in adultery
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:14.960]   or prostitution, or she was like a zealous feminist who was trying to make a statement.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.960]   Okay.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:21.840]   And the feeling in his mind is like, if you do that, you come in and you're just like,
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.360]   to us, it's like nobody wears anything like that.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.360]   So it wouldn't make a big deal.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.840]   I was trying to think of a corollary, but I couldn't really think of one.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:34.200]   I mean, there's, I can't think of something that a person would do who would come in here
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:39.560]   and they would have essentially an expression of complete rebellion and saying, you know
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.560]   what?
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.760]   I'm not under anybody's authority.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.200]   We don't even have something like that in this age.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.720]   But in Apostle Paul's eyes, that's what it would represent.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.240]   So the principle in order to get around it, huh?
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.040]   I guess, thank you for pointing out that.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.920]   I'm not even wearing mine right now.
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.800]   I can't use that example.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:06.000]   But if let's say, if let's say a husband and wife had their wedding ring and the husband
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   was saying like, Oh, I really want you to wear it.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.080]   And the wife was like, no, you know, and she refused it.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.320]   And that would be like the same thing.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.400]   I don't wear it because I gained way too much weight since I got married and it doesn't
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.400]   fit.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.400]   All right.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.400]   Anyway.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:29.840]   So I'm going to get another one.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.280]   All right.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:37.960]   So the big deal is that it was a symbol of authority and because of what the principle
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.680]   it represented.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.920]   Now there was another big deal about it.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:50.160]   If you would scan with your eyes the rest of chapter 11, okay, look at what it's talking
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.480]   about.
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.480]   Just take a moment.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.480]   I'll give you time.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.800]   Scan with your eyes the rest of chapter 11.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:03.240]   Look at what it's talking about.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:12.880]   Okay.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:17.920]   And then I'm going to ask you the question, how does that rest of the chapter tie into
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:25.480]   what he's saying now?
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:31.320]   How would it, Oh, how would it tie into the question of, you know, why would he make a
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:41.360]   big deal about something like that?
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.880]   If you just continue to look at the rest of the chapter, chapter 11, how does that all
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.880]   kind of tie in?
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:55.880]   In terms of the issue of authority or head shifting to a more independent space of the
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.880]   creation order itself.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:08.000]   Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   When you, when you mentioned verse 16, so yeah, after verse 16, it starts talking about
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.880]   communion, the Lord's table, all that kind of stuff.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:21.840]   I'm asking how does that section, father section, sorry, contribute to this idea of why Apostle
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:27.040]   Paul would make a big deal about head coverings.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:39.080]   Okay.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:46.880]   I'm getting at something more specific to, let's say if you look in starting from verse
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.960]   17 and says, but in giving this instruction, I do not praise you because you came together
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.000]   not for the better, but for the worse.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.840]   For in the first place, when you came together as a church, I hear that divisions exist among
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.760]   you and in part I believe it.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.120]   Right?
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:06.640]   So he's looking at a church that is struggling to stay together.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:11.360]   And then if you start having an attitude of like, forget authority, I don't want to be
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.400]   bound by anything.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.740]   If you have an attitude of, I'm not subject to anybody.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:20.080]   If you have an attitude of, I'm not submitting to you, you know what I mean?
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.080]   This is going to ruin the church.
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:25.040]   This is really going to divide the church.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:30.240]   And so Apostle Paul makes a big deal of this both because of what it represents for, yes,
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:34.280]   created order and what we're going to talk about, but also for the sake of greater church
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.280]   unity.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:46.040]   And so he talks about the kind of, um, and the next segment he starts to defend then
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.160]   his principle.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.480]   Let's move there right now for seven through 10.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.480]   Let's see.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.480]   Can I have, who's over there?
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.480]   Sincere?
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.480]   Is that you?
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.480]   Sincere, can you read verse seven through 10?
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.480]   For a man ought not to have his head covered in truth, in the glory of God, but the woman
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.480]   in the glory of man.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.480]   For man did not make the woman, but woman for man.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.480]   For indeed, man was not created for woman, but woman for man.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.480]   Therefore the woman ought to have a symbol of the glory on her head, because it is a
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:18.520]   man's woman.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.520]   Okay thank you.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.520]   All right.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:27.920]   I remember when I first as a young Christian read this passage being like, dang, you know,
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:33.280]   in the sense that perhaps a lady could read this in the wrong way and be like, dude, the
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:39.360]   Bible is very, in many ways, diminishing the value or the worth of a woman.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:45.280]   But let's take a closer look at the kind of rationale and reasons apostle Paul is giving
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:50.640]   in defending the principle of, hey, men have authority and headship and the ladies have
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.200]   a more submissive role.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.200]   Okay.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.060]   Let's take a look at verse seven.
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:00.220]   How would you define the kind of argument he gives there?
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:05.700]   To say that, oh, he is the image and glory of God and she is the glory of a man.
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.700]   What is he referring to?
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:12.700]   The greater to the lesser or lesser to the greater.
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:13.700]   Okay.
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.700]   Greater, one more time?
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:20.700]   They call it the lesser to the greater.
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:21.700]   Okay.
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:22.700]   Gotcha.
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.700]   Lesser to the greater.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.940]   So in one sense, absolutely.
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:35.340]   He's talking about man's reflection of God's image, woman's inspection of glory of man.
[00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:43.120]   But what I'm kind of pointing to is the idea of, he's kind of referring to the created
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.960]   nature, right?
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:50.700]   So for the blank there, if you want to write created nature, what I'm talking about is
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:56.400]   a concept more of just simply the image, the nature by which we were created.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:02.820]   If you were to think of our nature, it's hard to describe.
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:08.620]   But when we look in Genesis, the way that the scriptures describe our nature, it repeatedly
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:11.720]   talks about being in the image of God, right?
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.340]   Being in the image of God.
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:19.220]   And so this is an aspect of just the nature of how we are created and the nature of who
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:20.220]   we are.
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:22.300]   The reflections of God's glory.
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:29.020]   And then, verse eight tied very closely with that, when he says, "For man does not originate
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:34.420]   from woman, but woman from man," he is talking about not only just the nature of creation,
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.420]   but the order of creation.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:37.420]   Okay?
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.340]   So that blank is the order of creation.
[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:47.620]   And in 1 Timothy 2.11, when it starts talking about actual ministry positions of teaching
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:54.380]   and authority, Apostle Paul gives, again, this argument of the order of creation for
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:57.300]   that rationale as well.
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.980]   Okay?
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:03.900]   And then number three, in verse nine, it says, "For indeed, man was not created for the woman's
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:07.900]   sake, but woman for the man's sake."
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:08.960]   Okay?
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.540]   How would you guys describe that?
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:13.820]   What kind of argument would that be?
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:14.820]   Yes?
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:15.820]   Good.
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:16.820]   Purpose.
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:17.820]   Purpose.
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:18.820]   Purpose.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:20.820]   This is the purpose you are to fulfill.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.460]   Right?
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:33.380]   So, in thinking about that a little bit, I gave you this kind of extreme scenario where
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:36.260]   perhaps this lady is very accomplished.
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:44.500]   This lady is incredibly, I don't know, esteemed in every other aspect of life, whether it
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:49.620]   be her community, her work, et cetera, academically even.
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:55.740]   And she takes this position of like, "Wow, I'm not sure what's going on, but I have leadership
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:56.740]   capacity.
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.940]   I have proven track record.
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.660]   What's going on?"
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:08.780]   And to tell you honestly, in the Christian community now, I would say it's almost 50/50.
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:12.740]   People who believe that, "Oh, women should be able to have leadership positions in church.
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.860]   Women should be able to be pastors."
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:22.020]   Or on the other side is just simply, "No, women and men are complementary, but we have
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.140]   different roles.
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.740]   Men should lead and women should submit."
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:29.900]   I think the Christian community is almost divided and continually there are more people
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:35.020]   who would believe that women should have equal or like positions and opportunities within
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:37.020]   the church as well.
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.020]   Okay?
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:43.260]   So for you guys, if you ever come across a situation like that, obviously here are
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.500]   some rationales that I just spoke of.
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.980]   But my question really is, what makes sense to you?
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.220]   Does it make sense to you guys?
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:55.300]   And how would you, I guess you can share just some of the things we talked about a little
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:56.300]   bit.
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:57.300]   How would you communicate to somebody?
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:05.060]   Although, yes, that's an agenda and a practice of the secular world, this doesn't take place
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:06.060]   here.
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.060]   Okay?
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:35.700]   What I think is important to recognize, like in your warm up question, is that friendship,
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:55.380]   or equality, is not the same as role.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:56.380]   Being equal with somebody doesn't mean you should have the same role as somebody.
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.380]   You can see that very clearly by going to the head of Christ as God.
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:58.380]   Okay.
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.380]   So we don't say Christ is less than God.
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.380]   Right.
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.380]   We're equal.
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:02.380]   But he's subordinate in his role.
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:15.380]   And so that means that man can be head of woman without them being unequal in some way.
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.380]   Okay.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.380]   So different roles.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.380]   Good.
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:19.380]   Well said.
[00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:20.380]   Did you have something to add too?
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:21.380]   Yes.
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:30.380]   The fact that the instruction for roles in the church is irrelevant to roles in the business
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.380]   world.
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:40.380]   I mentioned in the group, Proverbs 31, the woman is shown as being good in business.
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:43.380]   It doesn't say she ran the house.
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:54.380]   It has nothing to do with the leadership, the role hierarchy of man and woman, the house,
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:55.380]   the church.
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:56.380]   Gotcha.
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:57.380]   Okay.
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:58.380]   Good.
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:02.180]   Anything else you guys want to add?
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.740]   Or I just want to take this opportunity.
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:09.780]   Is there any questions so far about this topic or the passage so far?
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:15.380]   Leave it open for that.
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.980]   No?
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:18.380]   Okay.
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:19.900]   Okay.
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:26.380]   Yeah, I think what David said is important.
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.980]   This could potentially be a sensitive topic.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:34.020]   And I hope that when we do talk about this, I definitely didn't want to come off studying
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:36.300]   this as like, this is what the Bible says.
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.700]   We're just going to apply it, read it and weep.
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:43.140]   You know, it's just not the way I want to approach it.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:50.300]   I think, you know, for example, if someone did, like, let's say a sister came in here
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:54.500]   and perhaps she came from a background where it was very much like, no, women, we need
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.260]   to fight for our position.
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.500]   We've been suppressed for way too long, that kind of thing.
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:05.260]   I think there's a sense in which this passage does both of harmonizing.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:09.540]   And I think I always appreciate the approach of Apostle Paul because at certain areas he
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:13.660]   can be very strong, at certain areas he's very cautious.
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:19.860]   And I think he can predict that perhaps sometimes we take certain principles like, hey, Christ
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:22.900]   is the head of the man, man is head of the woman.
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:23.900]   There you go.
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.140]   You know?
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:29.380]   And there have been guys, there have been people who said, so in everything, the Bible
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.940]   says literally everything, I have authority.
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:32.940]   You just need to do what I say.
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:33.940]   Right?
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:38.220]   I don't think that's the way God wanted us to apply the passage, you know?
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:48.020]   If you look at the next segment really quickly, over here in verses 11 through 12, it says,
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:52.740]   and we're going to start rounding things up a little bit.
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:57.660]   It says, "However, in the Lord neither is woman independent of man, nor is man independent
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:58.660]   of woman.
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:02.460]   For as the woman originates from the man, so also the man has his birth through the
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.460]   woman.
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:06.060]   And all things originate from God."
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.060]   Okay?
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:11.620]   And I ask, what are some of the harmonizing principles given in these verses?
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.140]   Can you guys just throw some out?
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:18.780]   It's pretty clear and obvious what are some of those principles, but some may be not so
[00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:19.780]   obvious.
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:25.380]   So if you guys can, throw out some principles that we can glean from verses 11 through 12.
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:30.820]   - Man and woman are dependent.
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.060]   - Good.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.600]   They're mutually dependent on each other.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:39.540]   So if a guy were to make the argument of like, oh yeah, you know, as you see created order,
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:43.500]   we came first, you know, and you just keep emphasizing the first, like, I was here before
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.500]   you, you know?
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:49.300]   And it's like, yeah, but subsequent to Adam, which you are not, every single one of you
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:53.900]   guys are dependent on a woman, you know?
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:54.900]   What else?
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:42:00.340]   - All things are originated from God.
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:01.340]   - Good.
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.260]   All things originate from God.
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:06.660]   And that one is, you can stem a lot of different principles from.
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:13.580]   For example, I think sometimes, I have talked to sisters who struggle with this concept
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:17.180]   and it's not so much because they're defiant or rebellious, but they struggle because they
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:22.300]   don't know how that's supposed to exactly look like, you know?
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.100]   The other times they struggle is fear.
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:29.540]   You know, they struggle with fear of like, okay, men are supposed to be in an authoritative
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:33.100]   role, but the fact of the matter is, the authority of men is complex.
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.100]   Why?
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.100]   Because we're all sinners.
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:39.860]   And the propensity is that when you have authority, your authority is used for selfish means.
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.900]   So what if I end up underneath that kind of scenario?
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:46.660]   Do I submit to selfish authority?
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:49.700]   Am I only supposed to submit to religious authority?
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:50.700]   You know, practical authority?
[00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.860]   Like, what am I supposed to submit to?
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:59.660]   And so sometimes I ease those concerns by saying, you know, when you think about even
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:05.940]   your submission, your submission is not like independent of God.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:11.420]   It's still underneath God's provision, care, and his own authority, right?
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:17.220]   So some people fear being, I guess, dominated by a man's authority, even if that man is
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.220]   not godly.
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:22.660]   But I remind them, your submission is delegated to you by God.
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:27.500]   A God who is careful, a God who has ultimate authority over our lives.
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:32.580]   Likewise for the guys, their authority is delegated to them, underneath God who is the
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.820]   originator of all things.
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.100]   Okay?
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.100]   Anything else you guys see?
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.100]   Yes.
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.100]   (Question being asked.)
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:43.100]   (Laughter.)
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:44:09.100]   (Question being asked.)
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:18.100]   Right.
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:20.780]   Yeah.
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.540]   So those circumstances are incredibly, did you guys hear?
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:28.060]   It's just basically two non-Christians get married, wife becomes a Christian, husband
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:30.100]   says can't go to church.
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:31.100]   Okay?
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:34.780]   Those kind of scenarios are very difficult.
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:41.620]   Why, typically you want to start asking about, okay, how vehement is he?
[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:42.620]   How does he respond?
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:43.620]   What has he done?
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:49.580]   You have to know the scenario as to how he's going to react if her safety is in question.
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:50.580]   You know?
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:53.500]   Those things have to be all considered before we ever give somebody like that advice.
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:57.700]   We can't just be like, well, you gotta obey God, so just gotta do it, you know?
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:02.260]   Because some people experience greater amount of persecution even in the home for doing
[00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:03.260]   what's right.
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:04.260]   Okay?
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:09.340]   But it's that aspect of, regardless of the circumstance, obviously every Christian is
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:13.920]   called to continue that strive and keep on persevering.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:19.080]   So first it might be testing the waters to see if she can go, even if he's resisting
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.800]   and all that kind of stuff, to see if she can do it.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.940]   If it becomes something more volatile, it's like, man, if I do this, then perhaps kids
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:28.220]   are involved, the kids are going to suffer, you know?
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:29.620]   That's another thing to consider.
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:33.740]   Or she's going to suffer, then you have to find different alternatives.
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.660]   Definitely seeking help and all that kind of stuff is good.
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:42.960]   But again, it's definitely, I think, the admonition always is to strive to persevere so that even
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:48.060]   the husband sees, gosh, my wife is dedicated to this beyond measure.
[00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:50.540]   You know what I mean?
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:51.540]   So yeah.
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.540]   Okay.
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:53.540]   Alright.
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:54.540]   Yes?
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:46:16.540]   I guess the extreme of that is like, well, we're taking it to its logical conclusion.
[00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:26.740]   Right.
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:32.380]   So the logic is clear, but it's that issue of like, when do you decide this is a command
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.460]   of God, you have to go to church today.
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:37.340]   You know what I mean?
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:38.340]   Like or something like that.
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:44.140]   So for example, if the husband says, go and kill that person.
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.140]   Obviously.
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:46.140]   Sure.
[00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:47.140]   Yeah.
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:48.140]   Right.
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:49.140]   Exactly.
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:50.140]   Yeah, it's not.
[00:46:50.140 --> 00:47:09.060]   And I read an article recently, one of the sisters posted it up about a wife who was
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:14.820]   in a home where the husband was, I guess, not necessarily like a fanatic or, you know,
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:18.100]   incredibly devout Muslim, but he was a Muslim.
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:22.020]   So there was no way that he was going to allow her to go to church.
[00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:26.940]   But the fact of the matter is I was very challenged because the lady said she tried in every single
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:32.060]   way and she felt a great conviction at least to denounce Islam.
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:36.740]   And that's a great, that's a step that she felt a conviction of that's an obedience to
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:41.180]   the Lord, which I would say, yeah, if you convert to Christianity, you can't, you can't
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:44.020]   just like lie and be like, no, I'm Muslim still.
[00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:45.260]   You know what I mean?
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:49.540]   So in those types of scenarios, she chose to draw a line where she said, I will obey
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:53.580]   to this degree and incur whatever wrath may come.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:58.340]   But on the other side, she's being creative and trying to, trying her best, you know?
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:47:59.340]   So, okay.
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:00.340]   Yeah.
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.340]   I think what Leo is referring to is the verse in Hebrews.
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:02.340]   Right.
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:03.340]   We cannot forsake the assembly of one another.
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:04.340]   Right.
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:05.340]   And the word assembly there, it's synagogue.
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:06.340]   So.
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:22.380]   It's pretty much saying don't forsake the synagogue, which would be today, the church.
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:23.380]   Yeah.
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.380]   Sometimes.
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:25.380]   Right.
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.380]   Yeah.
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:32.380]   I mean, it comes down to like, you know, the husband's going to beat her or something.
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:33.380]   Right.
[00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.380]   You know, like that's a whole different.
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:35.380]   Right.
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:42.980]   So, so moving forward and kind of wrapping this study up.
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:43.980]   Okay.
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:48.300]   It's a, this is a topic that again, is controversial to some degree and people debate about it.
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:53.180]   And some of you guys are like, I'm not interested because I already hold a stance of like complimentarian
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:57.620]   and I understand husbands are men should lead and the wives just submit and loving care
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:59.420]   for each other and we're equal, all that.
[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:00.420]   I get it.
[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.260]   So why are we debating this?
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:06.180]   Because there's actually, again, a bigger thought that he's talking about.
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:12.180]   Um, and the final arguments, again, we hit a lot of verses today, so sorry, this is kind
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:13.180]   of getting lengthy.
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:17.860]   And the final arguments, you can see that he is giving a final argument of saying, Hey,
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:19.620]   this is intuitive for you.
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.980]   There should be a distinction between man and woman.
[00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:26.820]   Um, this is something that it's just by nature you see, but then he ends by saying, but if
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:32.780]   one is inclined to be contentious, we have no other practice nor have the churches of
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:33.780]   God.
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:37.100]   And I want to focus on that idea.
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:40.780]   If one is inclined to be contentions, we have no other practice nor have the churches of
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:41.780]   God.
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:42.780]   Okay.
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:48.140]   Because I think he's getting to that idea again, starting from the very beginning of
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:53.960]   the book of Corinthians, we noticed that the church has struggled intensely with a sense
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:54.960]   of unity.
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:58.700]   They had stuff about, you know, their association with different leaders.
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:02.740]   I'm of Paul, I'm of Peter, I'm of Paulus and all that kind of stuff.
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:05.660]   We noticed that there was a great divide when people were starting to sue each other.
[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:08.540]   It's like they're taking each other to court.
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:12.540]   And then we're seeing various things that divide even in their immorality.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:17.180]   You know, when there is even sexual perversion in the church that actually divides the church
[00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:18.180]   incredibly.
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:19.900]   When there's adultery, it divides the church.
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:22.940]   It just divides the fellowship of the body.
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:29.720]   And then he sees people here, again, although it's gender specific, essentially you have
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.520]   people who are being contentious with each other.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:33.520]   Right?
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:36.600]   And he sees that as a great issue.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:40.600]   And when he says, "Hey, we have no other practice," he's not just simply saying,
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.160]   "Oh, we've got no other options."
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:47.120]   He's saying, "None of the apostles and none of the other churches teach anything
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.120]   different.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:52.640]   Should you so decide to refuse my teaching right now, there is nothing else.
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:58.400]   That the apostles of the other churches are teaching aside from this."
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:02.440]   And I want you guys just to see that as he's thinking about just the topic of, let's
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:08.180]   say, gender and gender roles and what men and women should fulfill, he is truly thinking
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:14.120]   about the greater unity of the whole church and how it affects it.
[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:20.880]   And for me, when I think about that, I realize, again, Apostle Paul is trying to teach us
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:24.240]   to be mature.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:27.360]   I think of it, this is just a side point as a way of conclusion.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:30.400]   I think about a person who is mature.
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:31.880]   Someone who is genuinely mature.
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:35.080]   It's not a person, in my mind, who is just simply disciplined.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:40.760]   It's not someone who, in my mind, who, I don't know, has made the steps in life.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:44.440]   Meaning like, they now have a job, they now have a career, they now have children, they
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.440]   now have all this stuff.
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:49.840]   That does not equate to maturity at all.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:55.880]   But just like a man is supposed to have a sense of responsibility over a wife and his
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:52:02.640]   kids, I think when people are willing to see beyond themselves, beyond their own rights,
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:07.560]   beyond the whole contention over the meat and contention over this, but they're willing
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:14.280]   to see the greater church and the health of the church and to take responsibility to that
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:19.220]   to the degree that they're willing to fulfill what role God has placed for them, whether
[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:20.960]   they like it or not.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.520]   They're willing to let go of liberties.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:23.920]   They're willing to let go of suits.
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:26.600]   They're willing to let go of their competition.
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:30.520]   In my mind, I see an individual who is matured.
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:34.560]   So again, I want to just say that as a means to say this is not just a study and like,
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:38.200]   "Hey, let's learn to debate and controversy over men and women roles."
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.440]   It's an issue to me of maturity.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:41.440]   Okay?
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:42.960]   All right.
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:43.960]   Any questions?
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:44.960]   Yes.
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:54.960]   From your discussion where one role is different from the four, we're kind of stuck on how
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:53:04.960]   to defend the answer or is it just talking specifically to that context of that church
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.960]   or that school.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:07.960]   Gotcha.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:08.960]   Good.
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.960]   We're just kind of stuck on how to defend that.
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:18.960]   So in terms of defending that, I would look to the specifics of the passage.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:25.800]   And essentially, the specifics of the passage says very clearly that hair covering is a
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:27.960]   symbol of authority.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.320]   Right?
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:34.160]   And so there are many symbols that culturally we have that represent something.
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:38.960]   And so in my mind, Apostle Paul, he is very much more concerned about the principle of
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:44.960]   headship and authority and he is acknowledging the cultural symbol that's in use at that
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:45.960]   time.
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:50.960]   Clothing changes a lot in the day and throughout time.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:54.960]   And right now, we don't have anything culturally that marks off, "Oh, you're a married woman
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:57.960]   or you're not a married woman or you're a married man, not a married man."
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:02.280]   But there are things that also, even in this day, that represent something to the degree
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:05.440]   of are we associating with something that's holy or are we associating with something
[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.960]   that's more rebellious?
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.040]   Right?
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:14.720]   So I would use that means to say that here, just simply ask, so the public wearing a lot
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:19.840]   of that kind of stuff, is that a universal principle for all time?
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:23.560]   The universal principle for all time is the roles.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:24.560]   Right?
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:30.280]   Husband, head, wife, submitting to that leadership.
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:33.080]   But the actual application of the head wearing would be a symbol.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.080]   That's the way I would do it.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.080]   Does that help?
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.080]   Yes?
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.080]   I have a question, but it's a little bit, I think, maybe not so much on the principles,
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:39.080]   but in application.
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:40.080]   Okay.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.080]   The scenario that you give, I mean, I understand it, but I think it's very singular in the
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:42.080]   sense that it kind of pictures or portrays women sort of being aggressive and asserting
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.080]   themselves into these roles.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.080]   So I mean, I think even other women would find women like this obnoxious.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.080]   Okay.
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:55:13.080]   Inside a church where there are women who are leaders, I mean, I would have to presume
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:24.640]   that the majority, like both women and men, felt like she was gifted and put her in that
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:25.640]   position, right?
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:31.440]   And so when we talk about gender roles and gender roles inside the church, are you kind
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:40.640]   of saying that churches that decide to do that are wrong in their application?
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.000]   Okay.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:48.640]   So to answer your question about just simply the churches that have ladies who are, let's
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:53.560]   say, teaching as pastors and whatnot, do I believe they're wrong in their application?
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:54.560]   Yes.
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.680]   I believe they're wrong in their application.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:01.640]   To address, yeah, the example I gave is a very kind of singular scenario of a woman
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:04.640]   who happens to want, has an ambition for that.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:05.640]   But you're right.
[00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:09.440]   Nowadays there are a lot of churches that encourage women and place people in those
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:13.600]   positions or even seek out specifically women because they want that diversity.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:18.600]   And in that kind of scenario, where do I put the blame?
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:22.040]   Yeah, it would be on the leadership of the church.
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:26.800]   This is one of those issues where I feel a level of confidence to say, yes, the application
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:33.400]   is just flat wrong because of the fact that the biblical passages that we see, they're
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:42.080]   not kind of implicit or vague, but not only is it explicit, but Apostle Paul gives timeless
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.820]   reasons.
[00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:48.700]   Timeless reason as in creation order, God's intention, God's purposes, that kind of stuff.
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:52.200]   So to answer your question, yeah.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:55.000]   So, okay.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.760]   All right.
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:02.400]   Does any of you guys have any other questions on that?
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.400]   That's good.
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:04.400]   Okay.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:11.080]   Let's take a moment to pray and then we'll wrap up.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:12.520]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.840]   God, we thank you for the gospel.
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:18.400]   Lord, we thank you for your truth.
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:25.600]   God, you are the one in your scriptures that said that in Christ there is no man or woman
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:28.040]   because now we are heirs with Christ.
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:34.240]   We have been bought by the precious blood and each one of us as recipients of your grace,
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.000]   we are heirs in the Lord.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.680]   Father, I thank you for continuing to teach us wisdom.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:44.520]   I pray, Father God, that although this is one of those just debated topics, I pray,
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:48.000]   Father, that we would approach it with great wisdom and tact.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.480]   I pray also that we would approach it with great obedience and submission to your word.
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:58.920]   I pray, Father God, that every single one of us would continue to just mature in our
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:00.320]   thought and thinking.
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:05.600]   Lord, as you've been challenging us through the book of Corinthians to see beyond ourselves,
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:10.280]   to see to the needs of the church, to see to the health of the body, I pray, Father
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:14.840]   God, with mature eyes we'd be able to not only assess that, but God, contribute and
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.280]   encourage that.
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:19.000]   I pray, Father Lord, that you would be with us and sing Christ.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   Let me pray.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   Amen.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:21.000]   Okay.
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   (audience applauds)
