[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I'm not going to name names if we're recording, so those in the brown chairs.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   But come up front because there's plenty of room up here.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Apparently.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   All right.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   We're good?
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   We're recording?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Okay.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   All right.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   We're going to get started.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.720]   Let me open this up in a word of prayer and then we'll begin.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.040]   Father God, we thank you again for another night in which we can study the Gospel of
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.040]   Mark.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.920]   We thank you so much for your grace in providing this account of our Lord and Savior.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.440]   That Lord, through our study, we may understand more of who our Lord and Savior is and how
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.400]   we may be inspired, Lord God, to really live out our lives in faith, to live out our lives
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.720]   for the sake of your glory.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:08.880]   And so Father, I ask that as we just go and pretty much conclude, Lord, Jesus' ministry
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.760]   in Galilee with the fourth withdrawal, that Lord, you may open the eyes of our hearts
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.200]   to see what your word has to say and that it may impact us, Father, not so that we may
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.480]   feel good about ourselves or have a better understanding of you, but that Lord, we may
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.080]   be responsible with the knowledge you have given us and to spread that knowledge to others,
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.840]   Lord God, whether it be those who are part of your kingdom already or those who are not.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.760]   And so Father, we ask for your blessing upon this time and in your name we pray.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.760]   Amen.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.040]   So, previously before, I always gave you guys like an outline of what we studied in
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.920]   the past weeks, but I decided to take that out because it's getting too much and I feel
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.200]   like you guys pretty much know what's, where the gist of the progression of Mark is going,
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.540]   so instead of doing that, we just go straight to the outline of Mark.
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.860]   Just very briefly, he started off in Judea in chapter 1 verse 1 until 13, and then for
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.100]   the majority of the Gospel of Mark from chapter 1, 14 until the end of chapter 9, which we're
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.860]   going to cover tonight, he was in Galilee.
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.100]   Chapter 10, we call that the turning point in which there's a pivot where Jesus' ministry
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.260]   begins to focus and go towards Jerusalem.
[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.380]   And then the concluding part of the Gospel of Mark, chapter 11 until chapter 16, verse
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.900]   8, we begin to see, well, Jesus is in Jerusalem.
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.640]   So again, the Gospel of Mark is a very easy gospel to kind of just follow geographically
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.040]   and it gives us at least a little hint when we hear the chapter numbers where Jesus is
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.420]   and where, what he might possibly be doing, and so that's one of the great things about
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.260]   the Gospel of Mark.
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.260]   As we conclude tonight in Jesus' ministry in Galilee, again, we took note of the four
[00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.260]   withdrawals.
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.980]   There are four withdrawals that take place, and each one has like a marker that indicates
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.220]   that Jesus left Galilee to a different region.
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.980]   We cover the first three, the past three weeks, and we're on the fourth one with chapter 8
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.300]   verse 13 until the end of chapter 9, and we notice that in verse 13 he says, "Leaving
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.900]   them he again embarked and went away to the other side."
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:45.260]   And so that's how we know that he made another withdrawal away from Galilee to another region.
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.380]   And that's just a brief outlook of what's ahead with the fourth withdrawal.
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.740]   And as you can see, there's a lot of material, and I'm sorry for that, but that's just the
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.360]   way John Mark wrote his gospel, so.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.660]   So we're going to cover all this stuff, all these important events.
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.300]   It's very significant, and so we'll try to take some time, and if I happen to run out
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.740]   of time, then we'll just, we'll end it there, and then we'll cover the rest the following
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.780]   week, so.
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.220]   All right.
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.700]   As we noted before, we're going to the final withdrawal, the fourth withdrawal, and verse
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:32.200]   13 takes note that after he confronted the failed tag team of the Pharisees and the Sadducees,
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.400]   he just leaves them.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.960]   He is upset, he is angered, he is sighing deeply, as we saw in verse 12, with the Pharisees
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.180]   and the Sadducees and their unbelief, and so he leaves them.
[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.460]   He doesn't stick around to debate with them or to argue with them, he just leaves.
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:05:00.240]   And he embarks and went to the other side, and he goes to the north and east side of
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.240]   the Sea of Galilee.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.000]   One thing that we'll take note in, and I'll probably repeat this over and over again in
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.960]   this final withdrawal, is that we begin to see Jesus' ministry taking a shift as he gets
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.360]   closer to Jerusalem.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:22.180]   He's no longer solely focused upon the public, rather the focus of his ministry is becoming
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:29.320]   narrower as he seeks to invest into his own disciples.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.500]   And so that's something to just keep track of as we track Jesus as he gets closer to
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.660]   Jerusalem, to see his love and care for his disciples and to see how much he wants to
[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:52.260]   invest into them, to prepare them for Jesus' eventual departure.
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:58.660]   And so they leave Galilee, they leave Capernaum, and they're going to the other side, and as
[00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.220]   we pick up with the story, the disciples go on to the boat, and they realize that there
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.220]   is no bread.
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:11.000]   They were in a haste, again, it seems like they just got confronted with the failed tag
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.900]   team and as soon as Jesus spoke with them, he just kind of left immediately.
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.540]   So without warning, they're embarking on another journey, they didn't have time to prepare,
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.900]   and so they had no bread, and so they noticed that.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:30.920]   And so Jesus, hearing their kind of complaints or hearing their concerns for the lack of
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:39.140]   physical food, he begins to, he takes this as a teaching opportunity, to not simply let
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.860]   them wallow in their physical need, but to really use that as an opportunity to teach
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.300]   them something.
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:52.260]   And we see that in verse 15, he begins by saying, giving orders to them, saying, "Watch
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:58.460]   out, beware of the leaven of, or the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod."
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.940]   And so we want to take note that there's a double warning that Jesus is giving to his
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:13.100]   disciples, he's not only calling them to watch out, but to also be aware of the Pharisees
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:21.460]   and the Herodians and what we will later see in Matthew chapter 16, verse 6, also the Sadducees.
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:29.860]   And so basically Jesus is warning, warning his disciples in this boat while they're hungry
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:35.420]   to be aware of the leaven of the Pharisees, the Herodians, and the Sadducees, or better,
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:44.980]   you know, if you want to sum it all up, just the religious teachers of that day.
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:52.780]   And so, as he gives them this warning, this double warning to his disciples, the disciples
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.740]   in verse 16, they say, "They began to discuss with one another the fact that they had no
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.020]   bread."
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.620]   So it's almost as if they just kind of heard Jesus' teaching and it just went, "Woo!"
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.660]   Like went over their heads, you know.
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:13.380]   And Jesus being a great teacher was well aware of their ignorance, and so he repeats himself,
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.580]   and he says, "And why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread?
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.580]   Do you not yet see or understand?
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.140]   Do you have a hardened heart?
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.380]   Having eyes, do you not see?
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.520]   And having ears, do you not hear?
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.740]   And do you not remember?"
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:31.980]   And then, in verse, from verse 19 until 20, he kind of recounts for them the great feeding
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.580]   of the 5,000 and the 4,000.
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.860]   And so, one thing that we want to take note of is the fact that during this exchange,
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.260]   there's a lack of faith by the disciples.
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.300]   Jesus kind of calls them out and says, "Do you not yet see or understand?"
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.620]   Or you know, better yet, "Do you have a hardened heart?"
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:58.100]   And so they still lacked faith to understand what Jesus was talking about.
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.060]   And probably because of their physical needs, they were hungry.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.780]   They wanted bread.
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:11.700]   And so, Jesus goes on and again recalls the two great feedings as to remind them of the
[00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.140]   power that he has to just kind of recreate food.
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:22.260]   But yet, Mark doesn't explain what the leaven, what that symbolically means.
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.380]   He doesn't explain that in this account.
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:30.620]   But in Matthew 16, verse 12, we take note that he, you know, he does explain to them
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:35.580]   what he means by the leaven of the Pharisees and the Herodians and the Sadducees.
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.940]   So if you want to turn with me to Matthew chapter 16, we're going to be flipping back
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:45.740]   and forth between the various Gospels here because we want to get a full picture of what's
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.740]   going on.
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:55.500]   We see in verse 12, "Then they understood that he did not say to beware of the leaven
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.220]   of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:05.460]   And so we take note that the leaven of the bread or the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.060]   was in fact referring to the teaching and influence of the religious teachers of that
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.700]   day.
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:18.380]   That as much as their teaching and the influence of the religious leaders, they might view
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:25.940]   it as being insignificant, it will have a widespread impact upon their future ministry.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.060]   And so this was Jesus giving a double warning to them saying, "You got to be aware of the
[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:38.980]   influence that the Sadducees and the Pharisees and the Herodians will give to you."
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.500]   Leaven is again that ingredient in bread that makes it rise.
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.900]   Just put a little bit of it in the dough and it will cause it to rise.
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:51.580]   I'm not a baker so I don't know if that's true or not, it probably is, but we all know
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:56.420]   that leaven has that kind of effect and yet he's using that as analogy to show that the
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:01.740]   religious leaders will use their influence to impact the ministry of the disciples in
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.340]   a negative way.
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:07.980]   And so he's giving them this warning in the midst of this boat as they travel across the
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:14.500]   Sea of Galilee.
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.180]   And so they arrive, they're on this boat, they arrive at this place called Bethsaida
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.940]   Julius.
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:26.700]   And I don't know if you guys are familiar with that name, but if you are, then kudos
[00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.260]   to you.
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:34.580]   Because this is not the first time that Jesus and his disciples arrived at Bethsaida Julius.
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:41.740]   We also take note in Mark chapter 6, verse 32 and 44, I think that's the great feeding
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.940]   of the 5,000.
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:52.420]   That's where Bethsaida Julius was and now they go back there and they're seeing, they
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.420]   enter into the towns.
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.660]   I just want to make sure that I got that one right.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:03.180]   Yes, it is the feeding of the 5,000.
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:11.980]   So they arrive there and they're received well and immediately someone brings to them
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.660]   a blind man.
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.820]   They bring a blind man to Jesus and they're begging him to touch him.
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:24.660]   Perhaps because they've seen already the power of Jesus to heal various ailments and sicknesses,
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:30.020]   so they kind of bring him along and they're just begging Jesus to just touch him.
[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:36.900]   Sorry, before we begin with that story, we want to also take note that this miracle is
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.540]   only found in the Gospel of Mark.
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:46.460]   This miracle and the miracle found in Mark chapter 7, verse 31 and 37, which is the miracle
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:53.060]   of Jesus healing the deaf and the stammering man, those are the only miracles that are
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.420]   recorded in the Gospel of Mark.
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:00.820]   We also take note that both of these miracles were performed outside of Galilee and in both
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:05.300]   of these miracles Jesus takes the person aside privately.
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:10.100]   And so again, these are private moments that Jesus has with the people that he's about
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.340]   to heal.
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:18.900]   And again, the private moment with the blind man, before he was being led by the crowds,
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.860]   but now he's being led by Jesus.
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.380]   Again we see that in verse 23 where he's taking the blind man by the hand.
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.500]   He brought him out of the village.
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:34.860]   Again the purpose of taking him outside the village is so that he won't attract attention,
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:40.420]   and he could spend that private moment with this blind man in healing him, outside of
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:47.140]   the onlookers that are just kind of, you know, just kind of goggling and just wanting to
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.140]   see a show, kind of.
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:54.100]   And so here he is with a private moment with the blind man, and here Jesus is having a
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.000]   conversation with him.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.620]   And he begins by spitting on his eyes, the eyes of the blind man, and laying his hands
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.900]   on him.
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:10.380]   And Jesus asks him, "Do you see anything?"
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:15.660]   And the blind man looks up and said, "I see men, for I see them like trees walking around."
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:22.140]   And so we take note that, you know, he's, uh, didn't heal him completely, right?
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.060]   He didn't heal him completely.
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:31.020]   And so Jesus talks to him again, and he said he lays his hands on his eyes again, and he
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:38.580]   looked intently, and his sight was restored, and began to see everything clearly.
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:44.220]   This is the only recorded miracle in Jesus' ministry that was done in stages.
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:50.860]   A lot of times we see Jesus' miracles where he just kind of casts demons out without any
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.860]   struggle.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.380]   He heals the blind, he heals the sick with a simple touch.
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:15:01.740]   There appears to be, like, really no need for stages for Jesus' healing.
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:08.460]   But yet in this moment with this blind man, for whatever the reason, Jesus decided to
[00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.200]   heal him in stages.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.060]   He heals him first, and then it's not clear enough, and then he heals him again, and it's
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:19.900]   complete.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:28.020]   So a lot of skeptics will look at this event, this miracle, and they'll kind of indicate
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.380]   that perhaps Jesus is losing some power.
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:36.500]   Perhaps Jesus is not as strong as, you know, he thought, you know, he was thought up to
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.500]   be.
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:43.020]   He couldn't heal this blind man in one shot, so perhaps Jesus is getting tired and weak.
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:47.420]   Perhaps he's not the Son of God.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.540]   But instead of taking that view, we want to understand that Jesus is the Son of God, and
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:55.820]   that this whole incident is not an indication of his weakness, rather it's an indication
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:01.660]   of the precise control that Jesus has with his power.
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:06.980]   Jesus has precise control over his healing power.
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:13.500]   And considering that this miracle is placed right after the disciples and their misunderstanding
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:19.980]   of Jesus' teaching about the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the Herodians,
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.140]   I think Mark is trying to make a point.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:29.580]   I think the Holy Spirit, through Mark, is trying to make a point showing that these
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:38.340]   disciples who lack the faith in Jesus' teaching before are in need of just progressive understanding.
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:44.060]   There is a need for them to understand in a progressive way of God's salvation plan.
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:49.300]   That perhaps the first time, just like the blind man with the first time, they have a
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.520]   fuzzy understanding of everything that Jesus is teaching about.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:59.780]   And that there will be a second healing, if you would say, a second healing in which they
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.340]   will be able to understand completely everything that Jesus taught.
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:08.060]   And that will come after the death and resurrection of Christ.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:15.340]   And so the story of the blind man at Bethsaida is not only a story, more evidence of Jesus'
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:21.700]   compassion for those who are hurt physically, but it's also an indication of Jesus' promise
[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:27.820]   to the disciples that you guys don't understand what I'm talking about now, but you will understand
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:34.880]   once everything is fulfilled.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:41.600]   And then finally we take note that Jesus, after healing him, just instructs him to go
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.840]   home.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.640]   Perhaps his home wasn't at Bethsaida, but he tells him to go back home.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:57.680]   And it appears that the now unblind man, if I can use that term, the unblind one, obeys.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:02.040]   Because remember usually after the healing and after he kind of warns them, you know,
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.720]   God takes note that, oh, he went about and told everyone and brought a big crowd about.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.680]   Well, with the blind man at Bethsaida, there isn't any evidence of that.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:16.120]   So it might be a good indication that he did obey the instructions of Christ.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.600]   Alright.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.600]   Any questions so far?
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.000]   Is that pretty straightforward?
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.880]   Thank you, Robin, for nodding your head.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.240]   Yes.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.720]   Alright.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:35.200]   The next topic, I'm calling this the five theological bombshells.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.040]   You guys will see why later on.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:46.480]   But we see that after his healing of the blind man at Bethsaida, Jesus goes out along with
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:53.760]   his disciples to this area called Caesarea Philippi.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.280]   And that's the backdrop of what's about to take place, everything that's about to take
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.880]   place right now.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:09.880]   Caesarea Philippi is an area, a region of Israel where it's a mountainous region and
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:15.480]   they are a polytheistic, like, city.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.560]   So they believe in many false gods.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.960]   And one of the things about this place is that they place these pedestals to these false
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.280]   gods, like, embed them into their mountains.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.520]   So they have, like, these little, like, shrines here and there where they replace their false
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.520]   gods.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.520]   Okay.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:40.240]   And so this is the backdrop of the city that Jesus is entering with his disciples.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:48.240]   And again, as we already noted, and I'm reminding you again, as Jesus gets closer to Jerusalem,
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.720]   Jesus' focus is getting more towards his disciples.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.500]   And so he begins to ask them these questions.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.680]   So in the midst of these backgrounds with all these false gods, Jesus questions his
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:04.720]   disciples in verse 27, saying to them, "Who do you say that I am?"
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:12.600]   And so it's kind of a very unique picture where Jesus is standing there, and it wasn't
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.540]   a comparison with these other false gods.
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.720]   And he's asking them, "Who do you say that I am?
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:27.160]   You see all these other false gods, but what about me?"
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.980]   And this question kind of kicks off the five theological bombshells, and again, the reason
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.140]   why I'm calling them the five theological bombshells is because Jesus is about to introduce
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:40.580]   a new message, a new message to his disciples.
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:45.220]   And this is a message that's really different from the message that the disciples preached
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.380]   before.
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:55.880]   As you guys can remember back in, I think it was Mark chapter 6, he summoned the twelve
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.120]   and he kind of sent them out and told them to preach to the various villages and healing
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.120]   people.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.320]   Well, this message is different.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:09.220]   And here is Jesus going to start off with this different message by asking this question,
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.460]   "Who do you say that I am?"
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.800]   And so, we move on to the next slide.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:25.200]   And the first theological bombshell that we encounter is the fact that Jesus is the Christ.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.860]   He is the Christ.
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:34.600]   We see in verse 28, you know, the disciples are kind of just throwing out suggestions.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:39.260]   They're saying, "You're John the Baptist," and others are saying, "You're Elijah," and
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.860]   others are saying, "One of the prophets."
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:45.740]   And Jesus continued by questioning them, "But who do you say that I am?"
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:49.460]   Peter answered and said to him, "You are the Christ."
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:56.020]   And if you guys remember Dr. Harris's message back in the summer, he's mentioning that "You
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:00.340]   are the Christ" is like a four-part affirmation.
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.260]   It's "You are the Christ, the Son, the God, the Living."
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:14.540]   Again, he's extolling Christ's identity to the highest level.
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:20.460]   Now we know that in Matthew chapter 16, there's a difference because after Peter gives this
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:25.660]   response of the fact that, you know, "You are the Christ, the Son, the God, the Living,"
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.500]   you know, he's commended, you know.
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:34.380]   He said, "Blessed are you, Peter," and all this other stuff.
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.180]   But we notice in Mark that that's absent.
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:44.420]   Rather, after giving the correct answer, he just, he warns them to tell no one about him.
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:52.260]   And so that's kind of unique to just the Gospel of Matthew.
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:57.940]   But we move on to the second theological bombshell, and that's the first mentioning of the Church.
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.260]   Now we don't find that in the Gospel of Mark.
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.500]   We don't find that at all.
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.900]   We find that solely in the Gospel of Matthew.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.820]   And so that's one of the reasons why there's five theological bombshells.
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.740]   Four are only found in the Gospel of Mark, but the fifth one is found in the Gospel of
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:13.740]   Matthew.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.740]   And again, that's the first mention of the Church.
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:22.460]   I'm sure for them, they didn't know that the Church was going to be like this.
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.860]   Perhaps they were confused and they had questions about what this Church would actually look
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.140]   like.
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:31.420]   But again, the message is beginning to change now for the disciples.
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.100]   They're learning something new.
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.820]   Whatever paradigm that they may have had is exploding.
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:44.140]   It's like Jesus is changing everything right now.
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:50.420]   We move on to the third theological bombshell, which is Jesus' death and resurrection.
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:56.020]   All throughout the Gospel of Mark, Jesus never mentions his death or his resurrection.
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:04.620]   And in Mark chapter 8, verse 31, he begins by teaching them that he is going to die and
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.820]   he is going to be resurrected.
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:12.460]   Now we want to take note that Jesus never talks about his death without his resurrection.
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.500]   They go hand in hand.
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.540]   They're like peanut butter and jelly.
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:22.740]   They go hand in hand.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:29.340]   We notice that Peter doesn't take well with this particular bombshell.
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:36.900]   With this bombshell, he takes Jesus aside and he begins to rebuke him.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:43.580]   Remember, this Peter was the same one that mentioned that you are the Christ, the Son,
[00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.860]   the Living, the God.
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.260]   So Peter rebukes him.
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:53.780]   But we know that later on in verse 33 that Jesus rebukes Peter back in return and says,
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:59.220]   "Get behind me, Satan, for you are not setting your mind on God's interests but man's."
[00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:03.700]   And so even though Peter was commended in the Gospel of Matthew, in the Gospel of Mark
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:07.220]   he wasn't commended and probably this is one of the reasons why.
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:13.100]   Because two verses later, he's going to get rebuked by Jesus and he's called Satan by
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.100]   Jesus.
[00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:20.660]   Again, remember Peter had a particular insight with John Mark, the author.
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.100]   So perhaps he asked Mark maybe not to put it in there.
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.260]   I don't know.
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:28.720]   But that's something that's unique.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.340]   And so again, this third theological bombshell is the fact that Jesus will die and he will
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.620]   be resurrected.
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:42.220]   Perhaps the idea of his death and resurrection shattered, maybe shook up whatever kind of
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:48.940]   hope that they had in Jesus in regards to his Messiahship, or in their perception of
[00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:52.780]   Jesus' Messiahship.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:57.100]   And so they're pretty rattled because of that.
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.380]   But the bombshells don't stop.
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:04.740]   Jesus has another bombshell to drop upon, not only the disciples but the crowd that
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.540]   is around him.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:12.180]   We move to verse 34 and it says, "He summoned the crowd with his disciples and said to them,
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:17.340]   'If anyone wishes to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow
[00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.340]   me.
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.860]   For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it.
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:26.420]   But whoever loses his life for my sake and the Gospels will save it.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.380]   For what is a profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.820]   For what will a man give in exchange for his soul?'"
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:40.780]   And so again, we see Jesus now stretching his teaching audience to the crowd that is
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:41.880]   around him.
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:47.500]   He's no longer just solely focused upon the disciples, we know that that is his priority,
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.900]   he's about to leave them.
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.820]   But he includes the crowd to hear what he has to say.
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:59.220]   And what he has to say is that there's a high cost to follow me.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:09.080]   There is a high cost for this discipleship that you guys are all wanting right now.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:15.400]   And so here is Jesus and he is making it very, very clear that if you're gonna follow me,
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.220]   you're gonna lose your life.
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:22.700]   But even though you lose your life, you're gonna gain something in return.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:28.900]   And so again, this is a hard message for Jesus, or this is a hard message for the crowd and
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.020]   possibly even the disciples to hear.
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:39.760]   I know a lot of us have used this verse to kind of describe our desire to follow Jesus,
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:46.920]   but putting in the context of everything that's going on so far, this is a very difficult
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:53.960]   message for the audiences to hear about Jesus' high cost of discipleship.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:28:00.040]   And yet he lays it out plain and clear.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:04.840]   We also want to take note, the fifth theological bombshell, and that's what we find in verse
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.080]   38.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.920]   The fifth theological bombshell is the glory of God at the second coming.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.580]   The glory of God at the second coming.
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:20.200]   He concludes his teaching to the crowd and to the disciples by stating, "For whoever
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:26.040]   is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the son of man will
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:31.640]   also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:37.320]   Again, you can't have the person of Jesus without the words of Jesus.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:43.860]   You can't just claim to believe in Christ and not listen to what he has to say about
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.200]   our lives.
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:51.440]   And here the son of man, here the son of God is saying to them that, "If you are ashamed
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:29:01.840]   of me, there will be some consequences when he comes in the glory of his Father with his
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.960]   holy angels."
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:08.160]   He attributes the glory of God with the second coming, and we can even go back to Luke chapter
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.160]   9, verse 26.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.000]   If you guys could turn there with me.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.720]   Luke chapter 9, verse 26.
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:22.640]   Again, in a parallel passage, we see in verse 23 that he's talking about the cost of discipleship,
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:27.080]   all the way up until 25, and then verse 26.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:32.200]   "For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the son of man will be ashamed of him when
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:38.000]   he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels."
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:46.640]   Again, in Jesus' teaching ministry up to this point, in the Gospel of Mark, there has been
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.860]   no mention of the glory of God until at this point.
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:50.860]   Here it is right here.
[00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:55.800]   "The glory of God is going to come at the second coming, when I return, when the son
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.200]   of man returns."
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.240]   And so all the references in the Old Testament about the glory of God, all the stories that
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:08.480]   they've heard in the Old Testament concerning the glory of God, is now being attributed
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.800]   to the second coming.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:18.360]   And within all those Old Testament references are the story of Moses and Elijah, and their
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.520]   experience with the glory of God.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:26.600]   And so all that is being attributed to his second coming.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:33.200]   And so again, you can imagine that the theological bombshells are just kind of rattling and shattering
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:40.000]   everything that the disciples had built up for themselves in their own understanding.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.240]   Perhaps they had a grasp of Jesus' teaching at some point, but now with these five theological
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:49.760]   bombshells, it's kind of like, this is a totally different message that you were teaching us
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.760]   before.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.420]   This is something new.
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:31:01.160]   But again, as we see, as we chart the progress of Jesus as he gets closer to Jerusalem, he's
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.960]   not holding back anymore.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.480]   He's bringing everything to the table.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:12.120]   This is what it is going to be like if you follow me.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.600]   Any questions with the five theological bombshells?
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.760]   It's pretty straightforward?
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:26.360]   Alright.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.360]   Moving on.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:32.360]   We move on to the Transfiguration.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:41.200]   The Transfiguration introduces a shift to the topic of the Kingdom of God.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:45.980]   And we see in verse 1 of chapter 9, Jesus is saying to them, "Today, or truly, I say
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:51.280]   to you, there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.880]   the Kingdom of God after it has come with power."
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:02.760]   And so verse 1 is probably in reference to Peter, James, and John, because of what they're
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:08.640]   about to see in the next, in the upcoming verses in chapter 9.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:16.120]   And so, so he makes this statement to them, to his disciples, and six days later, after
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:21.080]   letting that teaching kind of sink in for all of them, Jesus took with him Peter, James,
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:25.480]   and John, and brought them up on a high mountain by themselves.
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:32.120]   And so, yeah, I'm pretty sure that map on your PowerPoint, or your notes, really can't
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.280]   show, but, Cesare Philippi is right here.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:39.360]   This is where they were, this is where the five theological bombshells took place, where
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:43.960]   Jesus was comparing himself to the other false gods and saying, "Who am I?
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.960]   Who am I according to you?"
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:52.880]   And the mountain that they went up to, probably Mount Hermon, is right here.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:59.360]   And so you can see that Jesus is really going out of his way to spend time with his disciples.
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:04.120]   He really wants to focus upon them, and to train them, and to invest into them before
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:08.120]   what will take place in Jerusalem.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:16.080]   And so he takes the inner three to the mountain, and again, it's here where the transfiguration
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.480]   takes place.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:22.440]   And we note in verse 2, it says, "And he was transfigured before them."
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:26.040]   That word "transfigured" means "changed form."
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.520]   It's like the same word used in pagan mythology to describe, perhaps, a Greek god transforming
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:34.680]   himself into a human being, or something like that.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:39.200]   That word "transfigured" is also in the passive voice, so it means it's something that was
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.640]   being done to him.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:47.880]   God was transfiguring Jesus, revealing to his disciples who he really is, as the Son
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.880]   of God.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:56.560]   We take note that in the Gospel of Mark, he mentions that his clothes, his garments, became
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:02.200]   radiant and exceedingly white, as no launderer on earth can whiten them.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:08.140]   And you can't help but to think that perhaps the Apostle Peter gave Mark that detail as
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:12.520]   he shared his story about the transfiguration.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:19.440]   But we also want to take note that in Matthew and in Luke, they make an account of Jesus'
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.520]   face.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:28.480]   And in Matthew chapter 17, verse 2, Matthew describes Jesus' face as "shining like the
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.000]   sun."
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:38.360]   In the account with Luke, in Luke chapter 9, verse 29, his face became different.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:47.680]   And so, as to why Mark didn't include those details, we don't know, but all we know is
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:50.120]   that he didn't include them.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:55.640]   But we want to take note that his transfiguration wasn't just his clothes alone, but it was
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:35:00.760]   almost like a physical transfiguration that took place.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:05.840]   We also take note that he appeared with Elijah and with Moses.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:09.780]   We see in verse 4, right, Elijah appeared to them along with Moses, and they were talking
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.920]   with Jesus.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:17.080]   Moses, as you guys may have already know, Moses equals the law.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:23.440]   He represents the law part of Israel's, or of the Old Testament.
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.960]   Elijah himself represents the prophets.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:32.080]   And so you have two of the most significant characters in the Old Testament there, in
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:36.520]   the presence of Jesus and the disciples.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.080]   They also have other connections between Moses and Elijah.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.320]   You know, they both had mysterious disappearances.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:47.240]   We take note at the end of Deuteronomy, when Moses dies, he goes up to the mountain and
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.600]   says that God buried Moses.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:56.640]   God buried Moses so that his body cannot be found at the end of Deuteronomy.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:01.800]   And we also know that with Elijah, he just kind of got caught up in a whirlwind of fire.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:09.160]   Yeah, so again, there's some similarities in what Moses and Elijah kind of share with
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.800]   one another.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.120]   But also, they also saw the glory of God.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:21.040]   We take note of Moses' experience where he got kind of put in the cleft of the rocks
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:25.640]   as Jesus passes by, and it says that Moses saw his backside and his face like shine like
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.960]   crazy.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:34.400]   And then Elijah in the mountains, he came out of his cave after being discouraged with
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:39.160]   Jezebel, and he saw the glory of God, but he couldn't really see it because he had a
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.020]   towel over his face.
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:45.480]   So you had Moses and Elijah, they both experienced the glory of God, and now they're here with
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:49.960]   Jesus, the Son of God.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:56.080]   And Luke 9 verse 31 kind of reveals what their conversation was about.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.800]   Remember we see in verse 4 again that they were talking with Jesus, but what were they
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.800]   talking about?
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:06.080]   This is one of the wonders about having three other Gospels, because they can all shed extra
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.520]   details into what took place.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:14.800]   In Luke 9 verse 31, it says, talking about Moses and Elijah, who appearing in glory,
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:19.920]   were speaking of his departure, Jesus' departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:26.760]   And so again, Moses and Elijah were just not there giving like a chit-chat or, you know,
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.120]   talking about frivolous things.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:34.860]   We have Moses and Elijah, and they're talking about Jesus' pending death, what was going
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:40.720]   to take place in Jerusalem.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:47.960]   Now I kind of wonder here at this point, like, this might be a side note, but like how did
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:53.240]   the disciples know that it was Elijah and Moses?
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.680]   They didn't have photographs back then.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:38:02.280]   You know, so how, I mean, like, I don't know, Bible's not clear in regards to that question.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:07.640]   I don't know, it's just a question to ask, like, how'd you know that was Moses and Elijah?
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:13.120]   Perhaps Jesus made mention of them later on that was not recorded in the Scriptures, but
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:18.560]   anyways, that's just something to think about.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.480]   Going to the next slide.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:27.560]   We notice that after the disciples recognize this, Peter comes up to Jesus and he's saying,
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:31.400]   "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here."
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:35.680]   Peter is well aware that something magnificent is happening, something great is happening,
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:41.160]   something that probably only happens once in a lifetime.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.840]   And he's coming up to Jesus and he's saying, "Rabbi, it's good for us to be here.
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:50.360]   Let's make this longer, let's make this party happen, let's make it, let's extend it.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:57.560]   Let us make three tabernacles, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah."
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:04.600]   And so he's making a request to pitch these three tabernacles or these three tents.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:11.440]   We know part of it was he said it out of fear because it says that later on in verse 6,
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.600]   "For he did not know what to answer, for they became terrified."
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.680]   He mentioned this out of fear.
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:22.480]   But it's also quite possibly that Peter's a lot smarter than we think.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:28.160]   Peter was not saying this because he was, like, jibber jabbering or anything like that.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:33.800]   It's quite possible that Peter had an understanding that the kingdom of God might be inaugurated
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.080]   at this moment.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:41.680]   And so perhaps he's making this feeble request because he's understanding that something
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.960]   grand might be occurring.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.680]   He understands the Old Testament prophecies.
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:53.400]   He understands that before the Messiah comes, Elijah was supposed to come.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.440]   He understands all that.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:58.800]   And so he sees Elijah, he sees Jesus, he already knows that Jesus is the Messiah.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:05.200]   He's like, "Elijah, Jesus, oh shoot, something big about to happen."
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:14.480]   So he makes this request.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:18.560]   But recognize that Jesus never really answers his question.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.880]   He never answers his request.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:25.760]   It moves on in verse 7, "Then a cloud formed, overshadowing them."
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:29.880]   And it says, "A voice came out of the cloud, 'This is my beloved Son.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.280]   Listen to Him.'"
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:41.240]   Now the cloud overshadowing Jesus, it's very significant.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:47.920]   We notice in 1 Kings 8 verse 10 and 11 that when King Solomon inaugurated the temple that
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.740]   there's a cloud that came upon the temple indicating the glory of God or the presence
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:55.320]   of God is with them.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.360]   We take note in Luke chapter 1 verse 35.
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:06.600]   It should be 35 guys, not Luke chapter 1 verse 35.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:13.280]   It's the angel conversing with Mary before Jesus is conceived and saying, "The angel
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:18.000]   answer is said to her, 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.820]   will overshadow you.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:26.920]   And for that reason, the Holy Child shall be called the Son of God.'"
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:33.120]   And so again, we have this shadow, this concept of a cloud overshadowing people, indicating
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:36.980]   the presence of God in their midst.
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:44.040]   And so again, if we take this cloud here in verse 7 and how it overshadows them as being
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:50.760]   the presence of God, then this would make it the second appearance of the presence of
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:58.120]   God in the form of a cloud overshadowing something in 500 years from the time of Solomon and
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:08.440]   the cloud coming down upon the temple till now, to what we see here in Mark chapter 9.
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:15.440]   And so a cloud form that's overshadowing them, and just in case if the disciples didn't understand
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:21.200]   what this cloud and this overshadowing means, you have God speaking.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.700]   And he speaks loud and clear.
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:26.680]   He says, "This is my beloved Son."
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.000]   Now that phrase has to sound familiar, right?
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.440]   That phrase, "This is my beloved Son," it kind of sounds similar to what God said when
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.160]   Jesus was baptized, right?
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:40.480]   "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased."
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:47.480]   And so again, here's God, he's making a second reminder to the disciples there that, "This
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:49.080]   is my beloved Son."
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.800]   Just in case if you forgot.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.480]   Just in case if you don't understand what's about to take place.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:57.640]   This is my Son.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:04.080]   And instead of saying, "in whom I am well pleased with," he makes it clear to them.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:05.600]   He makes a command to them.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:10.480]   He says, "Listen to Him."
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.320]   I mean if you want to get any more direct than that, I mean sometimes we struggle with
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:18.000]   the Word of God, and sometimes we read the commands that we read here and we're like,
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.920]   "Oh man, I have to do that?"
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:24.680]   I mean, can you imagine how the disciples must have felt?
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:29.360]   I mean when they hear the voice of God himself saying, "Listen to Jesus.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:33.540]   Listen to Him."
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:41.960]   And so, in the midst of all of this, of all this that took place, we take note in verse
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:48.280]   8, "All at once they looked around and saw no one with them anymore except Jesus alone."
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:54.000]   It's almost, it's like an abrupt ending to what just took place in the Transfiguration.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.760]   But we know with further detail in the other Gospels, like in Matthew chapter 17 verse
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:02.840]   6, it shows the disciples on the ground, right?
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.640]   They're just kind of on the ground, not wanting to look up.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.880]   Their face were down.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:15.340]   And it wasn't until Jesus touches them that they actually look up, which we find in Matthew
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.780]   chapter 17 verse 7.
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:26.440]   And so again, the holiness of God compelled them to really be afraid of their lives.
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:31.680]   They prostrated themselves before the Son of God.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:35.720]   And it wouldn't be until Jesus coming and touching them that they would actually look
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.120]   up.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:43.920]   And so, there we have the Transfiguration.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:49.760]   The next slide here is just like a, just a little chart that I made, just kind of capturing
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:55.980]   the overshadowing part and the glory of God being associated with that.
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:45:02.300]   And so, that's just something for, just for your reference to take note of that when you
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:07.640]   read the other Gospel accounts, when you see this concept of overshadowing.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:16.920]   More likely than not, it's probably an indication of the presence of God in their midst.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:24.120]   As we continue on, we see that after all this happened, Jesus commanded them to not tell
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:29.880]   anyone what has happened until the Son of Man rose from the dead.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:37.520]   He commanded them to do this because he didn't want the salvation plan of God to take place
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:42.640]   earlier than where God wanted it, so he warned them not to do that.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:45.720]   And so, it must have been weird for the disciples to hear, like, "What do you mean the Son of
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.880]   Man will rise from the dead?"
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:51.640]   And so, they probably had questions about that because it says in verse 10, "They seized
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:58.360]   upon that statement, and they discussed with one another what rising from the dead meant."
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:04.000]   And as they kind of talked about what this resurrection means, the three disciples, as
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.840]   they walked down the mountain after this tremendous event, they just asked Jesus, like, "Why is
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:13.760]   it that the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:21.400]   And so, they open up this question about Elijah, and this question about Elijah is very important.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:26.320]   Because, not only do the scribes teach this, but the Bible teaches that Elijah has to come
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.320]   first to restore all things.
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:37.560]   And we find that in Malachi, chapter 4, verse 5 and 6, the last two verses of Malachi.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:41.320]   And so, basically, what the disciples were doing is they were just asking Jesus, like,
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:46.320]   "What's your interpretation of this prophecy here in Malachi, chapter 4, verse 5 and 6?"
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:52.080]   Like, "We know that Elijah has to return, the scribes teach us that, so is it true or
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.080]   not?
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.080]   What does that mean?"
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:47:00.920]   And so, if you'll turn with me to Malachi, chapter 4, verse 5 and 6, and Malachi is the
[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:05.080]   book right before Matthew, so just turn to the Gospel of Matthew, to the beginning, and
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:08.080]   then turn one page to the left.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:13.280]   If you have a Bible like mine, it has a page about the New Testament, flip that page over.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:20.920]   Malachi, chapter 4, verse 5, yeah, verse 5 and 6.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:25.520]   And it reads, "Behold, I am going to send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.600]   the great and terrible day of the Lord.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:33.280]   He will restore the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:39.640]   to their fathers, so that I will not come and smite the land with a curse."
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:45.760]   And so, they're asking Jesus, "What's your interpretation of this verse?
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:50.040]   Elijah has to come first and restore all things, what does that mean?"
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:53.600]   And so, they're asking, they're asking this because if the disciples are correct, if the
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:48:01.000]   disciples are correct with their identification that Jesus is the Messiah, their natural question
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.880]   is, "Did Elijah already come?
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.320]   Did Elijah already come?"
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:12.200]   Now we notice in verse 12 that Jesus affirms the teaching of the scribes and the prophecy
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:21.800]   found in Malachi by saying, "Elijah does first come and restore all things."
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:25.880]   And he, you know, Malachi 4, 5, 6, it just kind of describes like a restoration of the
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:30.920]   spiritual, spiritual relationship and preparing the hearts of the fathers and their children
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:34.560]   to repentance.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:41.720]   That's what it's kind of referring to, but it's also bringing into fact that there's
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.840]   a suffering involved.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:47.400]   There's a suffering involved with both Elijah and the Messiah.
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:52.080]   He says, further on in verse 12, "And yet how is it written of the Son of Man that he
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:56.920]   will suffer many things and be treated with contempt?"
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:00.960]   And in verse 13, "But I say to you that Elijah has indeed come, and they did to him whatever
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:04.380]   they wished, just as it is written of him."
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:12.760]   And so, here we have this coming of Elijah and the Messiah and the promise of restoration.
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:18.920]   And yet here Jesus is posing another question to them, saying, "Elijah did come, but he
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:20.760]   suffered.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:23.160]   He suffered just like how the Son of Man will suffer."
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:29.680]   So you have to kind of question, I mean, if you're in the disciple's shoes and you kind
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:33.000]   of studied Malachi, you're kind of wondering, like, what the heck is going on here?
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:40.160]   Like, Malachi promised restoration, and you're telling us that they're suffering.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:45.400]   And so in essence, in essence, what Jesus is revealing is that there are going to be
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:48.720]   two advents of Christ.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:52.400]   There's going to be two advents of Christ, and as a result, there will be two advents
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:56.880]   of Elijah that will come.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:02.220]   Matthew 17, verse 13 states that the disciples understood that John the Baptist was Elijah,
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:08.800]   so they viewed him as the Elijah of Malachi, chapter 4, verse 5 and 6.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:13.080]   And so there are two comings of Christ, and there will be two comings of Elijah, the first
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:18.520]   pair already occurred.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:22.600]   So the question that we have to ask is, you know, if the Messiah's suffering doesn't usher
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:30.080]   in the kingdom, and doesn't usher in this kind of full restoration, then does this mean
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:33.720]   that the prophecy in Malachi 4, chapter 5 is unfulfilled?
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.720]   That's the kind of question we have to ask.
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:45.040]   Those who say yes, that the prophecy in Malachi 4, verse 5 is fulfilled, they will have to
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:52.040]   do some crazy handiwork in kind of explaining all the prophecies of the restoration of the
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.560]   land of Israel and all that stuff.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:51:02.600]   But anyways, basically, the stance that, at least what I see in the Bible, is the fact
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.400]   is that there are two advents.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:10.120]   Meaning there are going to be, I mean, Jesus already came down once, with Elijah preceding
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:14.880]   him, and I believe that there's going to be another Elijah that's going to come before
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:17.320]   the second coming of Christ.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:27.920]   And that Elijah will make the road straight, and will bring in the kingdom of God.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:31.360]   And so, there's this aspect of double fulfillment.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:34.280]   I'm pretty sure all of you guys have kind of heard about this idea of like, you know,
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:36.360]   already but not yet.
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:42.020]   That kind of concept of a double fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, this prophecy
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:48.720]   would fall under that category of already but not yet.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:55.960]   As one of the commentators write, he writes that when you take all the Elijah references
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:52:01.480]   and put them together, such as Malachi 3, verse 1, and Malachi 4, chapter 5, verse 6,
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:08.680]   and these other references in the Gospels, it's a consistent explanation that points
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:14.000]   to two comings of Elijah, and also the two comings of Christ.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:20.200]   And so, there you go about that with the question of Elijah.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:26.240]   So, is there any questions about that?
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.640]   Any questions about the second coming?
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.840]   Do you guys believe that there are going to be two Elijahs?
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:34.480]   Well, one already came, but…
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.480]   Yes?
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:36.480]   No?
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.480]   Yeah?
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:38.480]   I have a question.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:44.480]   So, when we read 4 verse 5, I mean, I believe in already but not yet, the only trove I read
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:50.480]   is verse 5 says, "The great and awesome, the great and terrible."
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:53.480]   How does the first coming fit in with "the great and terrible"?
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:58.480]   I understand the word "great," the fact that he's come is great, but how is the
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.480]   first time fact that he's terrible?
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.480]   The second time, obviously.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.480]   He's not coming as a lamb.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.480]   He's coming as a warrior.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:10.480]   The first time he comes as a lamb, how does "terrible" fit into that description?
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.480]   I was always confused about that.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:20.480]   So, how does, in Malachi chapter 4 verse 5, how does that word, or the adjective "terrible,"
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.480]   describe the…
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:29.480]   I accept that it's in reference to the first and second, because Jesus says, he's quoting
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:33.480]   it, and he's saying this is in reference to right now, but not yet.
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:41.480]   He's doing a commentary on that verse, but I don't see how "terrible" could
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:44.480]   categorize the first coming.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.480]   Does that make sense?
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.480]   Because…
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:50.480]   Well, I guess you would have to see that word "terrible" as describing the day
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.480]   of the Lord, right?
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:57.480]   And so, I don't think the day of the Lord occurred in the first coming.
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:01.480]   I think the day of the Lord is in reference to just the second coming, so…
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:05.480]   But if this is in reference to the first time, he says, "Well, this is going to be
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:06.480]   fulfilled," right?
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:13.480]   I don't think that's what he's saying, but how does that adjective fit in at all?
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:14.480]   Right.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:21.480]   Well, I mean, maybe not just this passage alone, but also Malachi 3.1 also describes
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.480]   the first coming of Elijah.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:29.480]   Malachi 3.1 states, "Behold, I am going to send my messenger, and he will clear the
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:33.480]   way before me, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple, and the
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:38.480]   messenger of the covenant, whom you delight, behold, he is coming," says the Lord of
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:39.480]   hosts.
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:47.480]   And so, perhaps verse 5 is just in reference to the second coming.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:51.480]   Chapter 3, verse 1 is in reference to the first coming.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:56.480]   But then you would have to try to figure out what verse 6, where does that fit in?
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:00.480]   Because naturally it would fit in with the second coming, because verse 5 is talking
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:04.480]   about the second coming, but we look at verse 6 and we're kind of like, "Oh, he will
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:07.480]   restore the hearts of the fathers to their children, the hearts of the children to their
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:11.480]   fathers, so that I will not come and smite the land with a curse."
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:15.480]   So is that referring to the first coming or the second coming?
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.480]   Alright.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.480]   I see Val first.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:24.480]   [inaudible]
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:25.480]   Awesome?
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.480]   [inaudible]
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:28.480]   Okay.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:35.480]   [inaudible]
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:38.480]   Terrible as in like bad, like a bad connotation.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.480]   That makes sense too, yeah.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:46.480]   [inaudible]
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:49.480]   Yeah, I'm reading from the NASB.
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:50.480]   It says terrible.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:53.480]   I guess the ESV may have been more positive.
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:54.480]   And so they...
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:56:02.480]   [inaudible]
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:08.480]   I mean, you could also just talk about just how...
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.480]   how momentous that day will be.
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.480]   I mean, maybe...
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:17.480]   I can't remember if terrible being given a bad connotation, if that was just a matter
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:22.480]   of human language over time, just kind of giving it a bad connotation, but perhaps back
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:27.480]   then it was more of a description of how grand, how momentous this occasion will be when the
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:28.480]   day of the Lord comes.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:31.480]   So, could be that too.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:32.480]   Alex?
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:33.480]   Same?
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:34.480]   Okay.
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:35.480]   Hank, did you have a question?
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.480]   A couple things.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.480]   You know how you said second Elijah?
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:45.480]   Were you basing that on, or is that like, like speculation?
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:47.480]   Or is that, you know, the theological account?
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:51.480]   Okay, so what verse is the second coming of Elijah?
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.480]   [inaudible]
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:57:00.480]   I think that is reference to just all the Old Testament prophecies because you have
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:05.480]   to realize that it says that Elijah will come and restore all things.
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:10.480]   Yet you look at when John the Baptist came and when Jesus Christ came, not all things
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:11.480]   were restored.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:17.480]   And so, that leads to, you have to look back to Old Testament prophecies and see like,
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:23.480]   well, is it restored in a sense of like a non-literal restoration?
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:28.480]   Like, we all agree that there's a spiritual restoration that took place when John the
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.480]   Baptist came and when Christ came.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:33.480]   And we're all spiritually restored.
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:40.480]   But is that all of it, or is that just the already not yet kind of answer that we've
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.480]   been kind of giving?
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:49.480]   So, for me, it's just when I read these prophecies and he's talking about how, you know, he's
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:51.480]   going to come to the great and terrible day of the Lord.
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:56.480]   The concept of the day of the Lord is like, is talking about the end times and clearly
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:59.480]   we're not in the end times right now.
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:05.480]   And so, this gives me the, at least the idea that there is going to be another coming of
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:06.480]   Elijah.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:12.480]   Like the act of seeing Elijah in the Old Testament, or is that unknown?
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:14.480]   Maybe we'll note it when we see it.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:20.480]   So, I mean, people didn't know John the Baptist was the first coming of Elijah until, you
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:25.480]   know, well, the disciples figured it out, but yeah.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:30.480]   The other thing is like we were talking about how people were terrible, awful, dreadful,
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:31.480]   or awesome.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:37.480]   It's like in this few chapters in New York Christianity where it said that like Christians,
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:41.480]   we love the holiness of God, but we also hate it because we're sinners.
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:46.480]   And because we dread it, you know, because although we're sanctified or we get justified,
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:51.480]   in the presence of God, still we'll fall down like dead men because we are still sinful.
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:56.480]   And so I'm sure that if we were to ascetize and saw the transfiguration, it would be,
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.480]   it was great, but it was terrible.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:01.480]   And so that's what I'm thinking about.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.480]   Okay.
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:07.480]   So the terrible is in the sense of the coming of this holy God.
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:08.480]   Right.
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.480]   Right.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:12.480]   Thank you for the observation.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:15.480]   Any other questions or thoughts, comments?
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:26.480]   Would you agree that the idea of the two Elijahs, it wasn't crystallized that Jesus said it.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:29.480]   It was in the Old Testament, it was kind of sprinkled.
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:35.480]   But do you think they were able, like do you think one would have been able to deduce that
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:36.480]   hey, there's two Elijahs?
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:46.480]   Or did we have to wait for Jesus to say what he said, and then to, and to give a commentary
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:48.480]   and say, okay, that's what it means.
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:49.480]   Right.
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:54.480]   So James' question is, did the people of the Old Testament or as, you know, they received
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:58.480]   the book of Malachi, did they understand, right, if there were going to be like these
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:01.480]   two comings of Elijah and whatnot?
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:14.480]   I'm going to stick to what we saw with the blind man at Bethsaida.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.480]   I think there's a sense of progressive understanding.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:22.480]   And so I don't think anyone would have understood that there were going to be two comings of
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:28.480]   Elijah and two comings of Jesus outside of help, which they received with Christ and
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.480]   his explanation of all this.
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:35.480]   So, so the people of the Old Testament, they, I mean, they searched, they searched long
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:43.480]   and hard for all this, but, you know, they couldn't come to a definitive answer.
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:47.480]   And, and again, there's aspects of the Bible in which we don't know either.
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.480]   We just don't know how certain things work.
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.480]   We don't know how the Trinity works.
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:55.480]   We don't know how we're, you know, we're responsible for sin and how, you know, if
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.480]   God allows it, we don't know how that works.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.480]   There's certain things that we just, I guess, won't understand.
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:07.480]   And perhaps we may understand later, perhaps, but.
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:11.480]   And so there's a sense in which this is, this in itself is an act of grace in which
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:18.480]   God is, where Christ is just kind of giving his disciples further insight into the
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.480]   prophecy found in Malachi.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:30.480]   Okay. Any other questions? Yeah, Peter?
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:49.480]   [inaudible]
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.480]   Yeah, the two witnesses, yeah.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:02:05.480]   [inaudible]
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:12.480]   Right. Peter's question is, is second coming of Elijah kind of referenced in
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:18.480]   Revelation chapter 11, right? That's, that's your question?
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:23.480]   I remember reading that in a commentary.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:28.480]   And personally for me, I don't know, I haven't did like a study on that.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.480]   But yeah, I mean, I do acknowledge that there are commentaries that do say that
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:38.480]   Elijah is one of these two witnesses that is mentioned in Revelation 11.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:45.480]   So I guess for now I'll side with the commentators.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.480]   And let's piggyback on their work until I figure it out.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.480]   But yeah, I mean, you make a good point too.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:59.480]   So yeah. So okay.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:04.480]   All right. Any other questions?
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:13.480]   All right.
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:17.480]   I'm going to just end it here on this note with one more thing.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.480]   Turn with me to 2 Peter chapter 1 verse 13 really quick.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.480]   And we're going to end it here.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.480]   We'll follow up the rest next week.
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:27.480]   But 2 Peter chapter 1 verse 13,
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:32.480]   we know that 2 Peter is, you know, this is the last leg of Peter's life.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:35.480]   He's about to die, probably about to be martyred.
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:41.480]   And the thing that's on his mind at the point of his death
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:48.480]   is this event that we just read in Mark chapter 9 verse 1 and 13.
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.480]   In verse 12 it says,
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.480]   "Therefore I will always be ready to remind you of these things,
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.480]   even though you already know them,
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.480]   and have been established in the truth which is present in you.
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:01.480]   I consider it right, as long as I am in this earthly dwelling,
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:05.480]   to stir you up by way of reminder,
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:08.480]   knowing that the laying aside of my earthly dwelling is imminent,
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:12.480]   as also our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me."
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:15.480]   And then we go to verse 16,
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.480]   and he's going to remind them of this event.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:23.480]   "For we do not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:27.480]   the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:31.480]   but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:35.480]   For when he received honor and glory from God the Father,
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:39.480]   such an utterance as this was made to him by the majestic glory,
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:42.480]   'This is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased.'
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:45.480]   And we ourselves heard this utterance made from heaven
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.480]   when we were with him on the holy mountain."
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:55.480]   And so again, we take note that this transfiguration event
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:59.480]   really impacted Peter's life.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:02.480]   I mean, don't get me wrong, it's not done yet.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.480]   Peter still has to make the three denials that we're going to see
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.480]   during the Passion Week, right?
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:10.480]   We know he's going to deny Jesus three times,
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:15.480]   and he's going to weep, and he's going to repent.
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:21.480]   But again, this event really left a mark in Peter's life,
[01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:26.480]   and even on his dying deathbed before he's about to perish,
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:29.480]   he wants to stir up a reminder of this event.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:34.480]   And again, perhaps some of us have moments in our own lives
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:41.480]   where we can remember God being active or being clearly present
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:46.480]   in our lives, doing whatever blessing it may be.
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:49.480]   And so we'll end here for tonight.
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:52.480]   It kind of went a little bit longer than I wanted.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:56.480]   But please pair up with someone that you believe--
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.480]   I mean, I'm not going to make a joke out of this one.
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:04.480]   Pair up with someone and share with each other, maybe,
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:08.480]   an answered prayer, a way in which God has--
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:11.480]   you know, you have seen God clearly working in your life.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:14.480]   Share something in regards to that.
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:17.480]   I'm only asking that question because of what happened to Peter.
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:20.480]   He saw the Transfiguration on his deathbed.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.480]   He made mention of that.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:26.480]   So on your deathbed, what would you want to share with someone
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.480]   in regards to how God has influenced your life?
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.480]   All right, I made it into a joke.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.480]   All right, whatever.
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.480]   Yeah, so we're done.
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.480]   So you guys could go ahead and pair up.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.480]   And if you have any questions, feel free to ask.
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:42.480]   I will be walking around passing out homework.
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:45.480]   Thank you very much.
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:46.480]   Come back next week.
