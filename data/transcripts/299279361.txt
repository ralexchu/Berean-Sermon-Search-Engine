[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.240]   Good morning. Good morning, Berean. How are you guys doing? It's great to be with you
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:23.400]   on this special Sunday. And we want to thank Pastor Peter for having me. And yeah, we,
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.800]   I haven't known him that long, only two, three years, but yeah, there's a definite kinship.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.320]   I came home on Friday. I told my wife, there's just a connection with Pastor Peter. We have
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.480]   so many similarities. And it really is true when he says that we are like minded, like
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.520]   hearted. I hope you guys know how much your pastor loves you. He spoke at our retreat
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.760]   this past weekend, and it was just so clear. His heart for Christ, his love of the gospel,
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.720]   and his love for you guys. He boasts about you. And I know so many churches, man, that
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.360]   would do anything short of sinning to have a pastor like Pastor Peter. And so I hope
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.360]   you know how blessed you are to have him at the helm, leading you towards Christ. And
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.760]   yeah, if you have your Bibles, will you turn with me to the book of James, James chapter
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:27.600]   one? We're going to look at one verse this morning, a verse that may be familiar to a
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.520]   lot of you. And that verse is 27, verse 27 of James chapter one. And before we go to
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:49.920]   God's word, will you go with me to the one who gave us the word, let's pray. God, I pray
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:02:01.760]   that you would fill us with your spirit. Spirit of God, I pray that you would move in power
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:14.360]   and grace in a way that goes far beyond me and what I'm capable of. God, we need you.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.680]   This cannot just be some human activity. God, we are desperate for you, and we want to hear
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:31.320]   your voice. And so God, I pray that you would now, Father, open our eyes. Open our eyes,
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.960]   God, that we might see the magnitude of your glory. God, open our hearts that we might
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:46.120]   feel the weight of your grace. And God, open our mouths that we might declare the wonders
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:56.160]   of your gospel. It's in Christ's name we pray, Amen. Now, before we dive into the verse,
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.320]   let me give you the context of the passage so that you understand where James is coming
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.320]   from. In the preceding verses, verses 19 through 25, James talks about the centrality of God's
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:14.120]   word and how we are to be doers of the word and not just hearers. And the reason for that
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.000]   is because the scriptures were given not simply to inform, but to transform. To transform
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.880]   our hearts and our minds, our lives, and that change happens, that change occurs when we
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.720]   do what it says. And then in verses 26 and 27, James shows us what a doer of the word
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.720]   looks like. First, he says a person who has a true grasp on spirituality controls his
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.200]   tongue, that's number one. He controls his tongue. In other words, if you say you're
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.720]   religious, if you say you have faith, but you don't broddle your tongue, an unloving,
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.600]   gossiping, lying, deceitful tongue, then James says your faith is worthless. It's not the
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.960]   real thing. And then he says in the very next verse what the real thing looks like. Look
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:08.280]   at verse 27 with me. Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this,
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:17.080]   to visit orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unstained from the world.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:28.040]   This is an astounding statement. James says this is pure religion. This is undefiled Christianity
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.640]   as far as God is concerned. To visit orphans and widows in their distress. You see, true
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.800]   religion is not just hearing truth. It's more than that. It's not just a monotonous routine
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.760]   of religious activity week after week. No, the heart of true religion is to visit orphans
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.360]   and widows in their affliction. And that word visit here means so much more than just dropping
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.280]   by and saying hello every once in a while. This is a word that was used to describe God.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.480]   It was used of God when God would visit his people. And it means to seek him out with
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.760]   a deep concern for their well-being and a commitment to care for their needs. And James
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.240]   drives this point home later in chapter 2 when he talks about a true and living faith
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.680]   and how it's expressed in what? In words, right? In good works. More specifically in acts of
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.440]   mercy toward the poor, the downtrodden, the hurting, the marginalized in our world. And
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.480]   that's one of James' central points in this letter. Now it's important that we understand
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:32.000]   that what James says here in verse 27 is not said in a vacuum. He is not arbitrarily singling
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.280]   out orphans and widows as people we ought to care about. No, what he's doing is he is
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.600]   reiterating what God has said all throughout the Old Testament about the people that he
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.540]   cares about. And when you read the Old Testament scriptures, you find that there are three
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:53.040]   groups of people that God singles out time and time and time again as the objects of
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.320]   his special mercy. And they are the orphan, the widow, and the sojourner. The orphan,
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.960]   the widow, and the sojourner. For instance, Deuteronomy 10, 18 says, "He executes justice
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.480]   for the fatherless and the widow and loves a sojourner, giving him food and clothing."
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.800]   Psalm 146, verse 9, "The Lord watches over the sojourners. He upholds the widows and
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.480]   the fatherless." So God, God describes himself as their defender, their protector, their
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:25.320]   provider, and not surprisingly, he expects his people to do the same. And we see an example
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.040]   of this in Deuteronomy 14, 28, where God says, "At the end of every three years, you shall
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.680]   bring out all the tithes of your produce in the same year and lay it up within your towns.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:39.280]   And the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your towns, shall come
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.400]   and eat and be filled, that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:51.940]   hands that you do." So God promises to bless those who bless them. Conversely, God also
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:58.240]   warns of judgment and punishment to those who mistreat them. For instance, in Exodus
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:05.840]   22, verse 21, God says, "You shall not wrong a sojourner or oppress him. You shall not
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.360]   mistreat any widow or fatherless child. If you mistreat them and they cry out to me,
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:16.440]   I will surely hear their cry, and my wrath will burn, and I will kill you with a sword,
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.480]   and your wives shall become widows and your children fatherless." Wow, God is not messing
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:26.720]   around here, is he? He is dead serious when it comes to caring about the orphan, the widow,
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.520]   and the sojourner, all of which begs the question, "Why?" Why does he care about them so much?
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:38.840]   Why is he so drawn to the orphan, the widow, and the sojourner? Here's why. Because they
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:45.920]   were the most helpless. They were the most vulnerable. They were the most powerless in
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.360]   that society. To be a sojourner meant that you were incredibly vulnerable, because in
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.880]   that day, your tribe was everything. And to be away from your people, your tribe, meant
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.480]   that you had nothing. You were incredibly vulnerable. And to be a widow in that day,
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.280]   guys, was vastly different from what it is to be a widow today. Today, there are all
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:10.040]   kinds of social programs that care for widows. But no such thing existed in biblical times.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.400]   To be a widow in that day meant that you were on your own, and it was even worse for the
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:22.200]   orphan. There were no welfare programs for orphans. There were no orphanages to take
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.520]   them in. There was no foster care system. There was no such thing. To be an orphan in
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:33.080]   that day meant that you had no one to look after you, no one to protect you, no one to
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.880]   provide for you. You were entirely on your own. And it's one thing for a grown-up, for
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:45.800]   an adult to fend for himself. Man, it's another thing for a child to fend for himself or herself
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:52.740]   in a savage, brutal world. And understandably, they were the most vulnerable of them all.
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:57.280]   And that is why God refers to Himself, get this, God refers to Himself as the Father
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.360]   to the fatherless. God says, "That's who I am. I am the Father to the fatherless." He
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:10.040]   is decisively drawn to them, and He takes up their cause. And consequently, He expects
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:20.680]   Israel to take up their cause. Why? Because that's exactly what God had done for them.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:26.320]   You see, Israel was the sojourner before God called them and made them His people. Israel
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:32.160]   was the widow before God became her husband. Israel was the orphan before God became their
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:40.040]   father. And men and women, listen, it is no different with you and me today. It is no
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:48.260]   different with us. We were sojourners, were we not? We were sojourners wandering aimlessly
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:55.120]   until Christ found us and saved us. We were spiritual widows until Christ, our bridegroom,
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.720]   entered into an everlasting covenant with us. And we were spiritual orphans without
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:06.280]   a father until God adopted us into His family through Christ. That was us. And that's what
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:14.640]   a Christian is. A Christian is one who says, "That was me. I was helpless. I was vulnerable.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:21.800]   I was fatherless, but I was shown mercy. God had mercy on me, and He sent His Son to rescue
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.760]   me." So when you come across someone who is actually helpless, actually vulnerable, actually
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:34.920]   fatherless, you see you. You see yourself. You see who you once were, and you see what
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:43.800]   God and His mercy has done for you, and that in turn causes you to do something for them.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:50.280]   Orphan care will not mean much to you if the single truth does not take hold of your heart
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:57.080]   until you see just how personal this is. Brothers and sisters, it's going to be hard for you
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:03.040]   to see why James says pure and undefiled religion is caring for orphans until you see that that's
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.280]   exactly what God and Christ has done for you. That when we were spiritual orphans without
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:15.920]   a father, Christ came for us. He sought us out, and we have been adopted into the family
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:24.200]   of God. We, you and I, we have been adopted by God. Oh, let that sink in. You and I, we
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:29.440]   have been adopted by God. I know you've heard that a thousand times. Hear it again. We have
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.720]   been adopted by the God of the universe. Oh, Christian, feel the weight of that all over
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:43.760]   again. You and I are the adopted children of God, and here's why this is so important.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:51.080]   Because as Tony Merida has said, your theology inevitably leads to your biography. Your theology
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:58.640]   inevitably leads to your biography. In other words, your understanding of God will determine
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:06.520]   what you do with your life, always. What you believe about God determines how you live,
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.480]   always. That's why when it comes to this issue of orphan care, the place where we have to
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:20.440]   begin is to understand what God in His mercy has done for us. And Paul tells us in Galatians
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.280]   4, this is one of my favorite passages in all of Scripture. "When the fullness of time
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:33.320]   had come, God sent forth His Son, born of woman, born under law to redeem those under
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:42.240]   the law, so that we might receive adoption as son." Paul says God sent His Son to redeem
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.900]   us how? By fulfilling the requirements of the law on our behalf, thus justifying us
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:53.480]   before God. That is, we are declared righteous before God, not based on anything we have
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:13:02.600]   done, but based entirely on what Christ has done for us. Now that in itself is astounding,
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:08.360]   that a holy God would send His own Son for sinners like us is amazing. And if that's
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:13.320]   all there was to God sending Christ, if there was a period after to redeem those under the
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.840]   law, none of us should be disappointed. We would have more than enough reason to praise
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:23.760]   God forever and a day, but it doesn't end there. Paul says God's purpose in sending
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:30.720]   Christ doesn't stop with our justification. No, he says we were justified so that purpose
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:38.080]   clause, so that we might receive adoption as sons. In other words, God's purpose began
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:46.960]   with redemption. It culminated with adoption. It began with redemption, but it culminated
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:52.720]   with adoption. Listen, to be declared righteous, to be declared righteous by God, the judge
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:59.200]   is amazing. But Paul says as great as that is, that's not even the best part. What do
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.680]   you mean that's not even the best part? You mean to tell me that there's a greater and
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:09.640]   a greater with God? Yes, and the greater is knowing that you are loved by God, the Father.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.200]   And that's what led J.I. Packer to write, "Adoption is the highest privilege that the
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:19.200]   gospel offers, higher even than justification. Adoption is higher because of the richer relationship
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:24.760]   with God that involves adoption as a family idea conceived in terms of love and viewing
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.320]   God as Father." And then he says, "Our understanding," listen to what he says, "Our understanding
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:38.200]   of Christianity cannot be better than our grasp of adoption." In other words, the extent
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:45.440]   to which you get adoption, understand adoption is the extent to which you get the gospel.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:54.780]   And that's why John Piper, my personal hero, said adoption is the heart of the gospel.
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:15:03.080]   Adoption is the heart of the gospel. Brothers and sisters, this is central to who we are.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:10.080]   This is what is at the core of who we are, the adopted children, sons and daughters of
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:15.600]   God. That's what defines us. And not only are we as adopted children, Paul tells us
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.680]   in verse 7, "So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:31.800]   God." Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? We have great, we have greater, here we
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:40.600]   have the greatest. You are an heir of God. Think about that. You're not just a son now,
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:46.880]   you will be a son forever. And you've got an inheritance awaiting you. All that God
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:54.480]   is, all that God has, the unsearchable riches of His grace, belong to you and me as His
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:16:01.000]   children. Now there are a couple of things that I want to point out here. The first is
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:09.280]   that in the ancient world, the father's inheritance was restricted only to his what? His sons.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:14.120]   Only sons could gain an inheritance, daughters could not. And guys, that's why Paul addresses
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.960]   all of us here as sons. He's not being chauvinistic as a lot of people today accuse him of being.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:25.240]   He's saying when it comes to God and the inheritance of God, we are all sons before Him. Now that
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:31.520]   raises the question, what if a man didn't have a son to give his inheritance to? In
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:37.480]   the ancient world, if a man did not have a son, he would adopt a son. He adopted a son
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:44.480]   so that he would have an heir. Now guys, here's what this means. God's adoption of sinners
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:50.080]   like you and me wasn't necessary. Oh, you got to get this. God's adoption of sinners
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.400]   like you and me wasn't necessary. God didn't have to adopt us because you see, God already
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:17:00.320]   had a son. He didn't need an heir because he already had an heir. But in His great mercy,
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.560]   in His great love, God sent His son, His heir, and He crushed him. He crushed him so that
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:12.160]   you and I might become the sons and heirs of God. Here's something else we need to know
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:20.720]   about our adoption. Adoption in God's mind was not plan B. I repeat, adoption in God's
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:29.280]   mind was not plan B. Adopting us was not a consolation prize for God. Listen to what
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:34.160]   Paul writes in Ephesians 1, 3 through 5 in Philibrand, one of the verses. "Blessed be
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.480]   the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.120]   blessing in the heavenly places, even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:48.320]   world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him in love. In love He predestined
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:54.240]   us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ according to the purpose of His will, to the
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:00.240]   praise of His glorious grace." Oh, we like to debate this passage. Let's just delight
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:10.360]   in it. Paul says, "Before the world even existed, God had in mind to adopt you and me." You
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:17.680]   see, our adoption was not plan B. Adopting us for God was plan A. It wasn't second best
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:23.840]   for God. It wasn't an afterthought. No, He had planned it from eternity past. And that
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:29.720]   again is why Piper says adoption is the heart of the gospel. And that's why adoption for
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:37.960]   us as believers, guys, isn't just a good thing to do. The gospel necessitates it. The gospel
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:47.160]   necessitates it. The gospel necessitates that we do for others what God in Christ has done
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:52.840]   for us. That much is clear, is it not? Man, the vertical love, the love of God that we
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:19:02.240]   embrace, the vertical adoption we celebrate has to, it's got to translate into the horizontal.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.240]   Now I'm not saying every Christian has to adopt. That is not what I'm saying. I personally
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.560]   don't believe that. I don't believe God calls every Christian to adopt, but I believe with
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.280]   all my heart that every Christian, everyone who is in Christ has a stake in the matter.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:20.160]   You know why? Because God does. Our God has a huge stake in the matter. And if we are
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:25.080]   as people called to be imitators of God, then we have got to do for others what God has
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:33.880]   done for us. And that's why what we do as Christians isn't mere humanitarianism. And
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:43.560]   it's not driven by altruism. That's why adoption isn't for couples who can't have kids. It's
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:49.920]   for people who are attuned to the gospel. It's for people who love the gospel. It's
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.000]   for people who have been changed, transformed by the, it's for people who want to proclaim
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.840]   the gospel and live out the gospel in their lives. And the reason adoption so powerfully
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:07.000]   displays the gospel is because it's the one act that most directly mirrors what God has
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:14.240]   done for us, God's actions toward us. When redeemed, men and women extend a hand of mercy
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:21.760]   and bring in children in need. Oh man, the world sees a real life picture of the gospel.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.560]   I mean think about how counter-cultural it is for Christians to adopt or bring in a young
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:32.720]   boy with a club palate from India where most people see him as cursed or defective. How
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:38.880]   counter-intuitive it is for Christians to adopt children of a different race or ethnicity.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:46.240]   White adopting brown, brown adopting yellow, yellow adopting black. What better way, what
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:51.560]   better way to display to the world that God adopts children from every nation, tribe,
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:58.520]   and tongue. So it's the gospel. That's what lies at the core of orphan care. It's the
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:06.200]   gospel that compels us to care for orphans and adopt them, but it doesn't end there.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:13.560]   Men and women, it's the gospel that sustains us in our adoption of orphans. In other words,
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:20.440]   what compels us and motivates us to adopt orphans is the very thing that sustains us
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:32.080]   in our adoption because adoption is not easy. It is not an easy thing. And it's important
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.720]   that I say that because I think much of what's done for orphans in our culture, even in the
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:45.240]   church culture, is owing to altruism and in some respects a desire for selfish gain. And
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:49.880]   that was sort of the case for me. You know when my wife and I were looking to adopt our
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:55.400]   second child, our first son, we adopted him locally through the foster care system here
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:02.680]   in LA. But when we felt God calling us to adopt again, we wanted to adopt internationally.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:11.720]   So guess what country I had us look into first? The Dominican Republic. Now why, of all places,
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:18.160]   the Dominican Republic? Here's why. That tiny little country produces a lot of great
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:27.040]   shortstops. And as a diehard baseball fan, as a diehard Dodger fan, yeah I know, I've
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.640]   been in depression the last seven days, straight up dark, not in the soul, I can't believe
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:38.960]   we lost again. I can't believe we went that far and lost again. Don't get me started.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:44.360]   But I had this vision. I envisioned adopting this kid from the Dominican Republic who would
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:49.600]   one day grow up to play shortstop for the Dodgers, for real. I wish I was making this
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:54.480]   up, I'm not, you can ask my wife. But God closed those doors, the Dominican Republic
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.840]   didn't work out, we didn't meet the requirements. So the next country I had us look into was
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:09.480]   Venezuela. Because Venezuela also produces a lot of great baseball players. But you know,
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:15.400]   I think that kind of mindset is a lot more common than we like to admit. I mean, adoption
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:20.800]   has become almost trendy in our day, has it not? It's cool to care for orphans now. And
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.440]   we hear about all these Hollywood celebrities like Madonna, Sandra Bullock, Charlize Theron
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:29.920]   who adopt, and we're tempted to jump on the bandwagon. And I think there lurks in the
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:34.400]   back of a lot of people's minds this idea, this idea that man, it would be so cool to
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.160]   have this cute little kid from another race or country in our Christmas cards that we
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:45.080]   send out to all of our family and friends. But here's the problem. What happens when
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:52.600]   the child you bring into your home isn't all that cute? What happens when that child suffers
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.520]   from emotional dysregulation and can't even sit still for the family photo shoot without
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:03.080]   melting down? What happens when that child has real developmental delays because she
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:08.760]   was exposed to drugs and alcohol in the womb? What happens when you try to love that child,
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:13.080]   but she rejects it? She just pushes you away every time because she doesn't know what to
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:17.880]   do with it. She's never experienced love and affection. She pushes you away. What happens
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:24.440]   then? What happens when the child you bring into your home puts your other children at
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:31.960]   risk because of his violent outbursts? You see, altruism will not get you through that.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:36.620]   The only thing that will, the only thing that will sustain you and carry you through that
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:46.920]   is a cross, the cross of Christ. A while back, Jean shared with me a blog written by an adoptive
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:52.520]   mom named Stacey Gagnon, and I want to share with you a part of what she wrote in a post
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:25:00.200]   entitled "How Adoption Destroyed My Life." What a title. "How Adoption Destroyed My Life,"
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:06.880]   she writes, "I was warned these kids will ruin your life. I was warned that they grow
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:12.440]   up and they won't be so cute when you're caring for a 35-year-old still living in your home.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:18.740]   What if they are so damaged they end up in prison? What if they can never love you back
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:24.240]   and you poured all this money and time into them? What if doing this totally destroys
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:30.800]   everything you built for yourself? How will this affect your biological children? Aren't
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:38.400]   you too old for this? What if they ruin you? I say it's time we evaluated what we are living
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:47.400]   for and choose to be ruined. Maybe ruination is where we're supposed to live. Maybe this
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.920]   adoption thing is hard work, ugly tears, broken hearts, and sleepless nights. Maybe it's a
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:58.280]   daily struggle and the rewards are small and few. Perhaps the costs outweigh the gain.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:04.480]   It's possible that they grow up to become felons or they never learn to live independently.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.640]   Perhaps they hate me and want to hurt me because it's too much to trust an adult again. Maybe
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:15.160]   their fear is bigger than my love. Maybe I choose adoption because Christ adopted me
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:22.100]   when I was broken, when I was irredeemable, and when I was hard work. Maybe He chose me
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:27.320]   when nobody else would. Maybe God took my broken pieces and loved me in spite of the
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:34.520]   reward. Maybe He picked me when I had nothing to give to Him. I look at this ruination and
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:39.080]   I guess I don't see the mess, the pain, the reality. I guess love must make me blind to
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:45.400]   the present and the past, but it opens my eyes wide to eternity because of what I see
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:50.960]   our children that I love fiercely. I see the blessing of the tiny victories because I know
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:57.240]   the steep path taken to achieve them. I see the blessing. I see the internal battles and
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:07.280]   the emotional scars, and I marvel at the resilience. My eyes are now open, and I guess this ruination
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:15.320]   is exactly where I want to live because God, you live there too. And brothers and sisters,
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:28.040]   He does. God does. Jean and I have experienced this ruination too. Having adopted two boys,
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:37.200]   we have seen firsthand the brutality and the beauty of adoption. We have seen firsthand
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:45.640]   how trauma has shaped them and the loss those boys deal with every single day. And there
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:51.960]   have been plenty of days for both of us. There were so many days filled with darkness and
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:28:00.960]   despair, especially as it relates to our second son, Jackson. We got Jackson when he was two
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:08.640]   months old, and at that point of two months, we were his third placement. For starters,
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:15.320]   he was exposed to drugs and alcohol in the womb, and if that wasn't enough, in one of
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:22.920]   the previous homes, the one right before he came home to us, he was severely neglected.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:31.160]   Whereas a newborn, a newborn baby, he was left in the crib to cry for hours on end,
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:36.360]   all of which affected his brain development and the way he's able to manage and control
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:45.160]   his emotions. And it's most commonly expressed in loud outbursts, tantrums, meltdowns, and
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:53.680]   they're constant. They're constant. And there's only so much one could take, you know? About
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:29:03.640]   the hundredth one, man, I'm done. And I've lost it more times than I care to remember.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:09.080]   And I've had to do business with God over this. More specifically, I've had to deal
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:15.000]   with my resentment towards God. See, my wife grieved, Jean grieved. She grieved the loss
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:23.040]   of normalcy in our home. I got mad. I got angry with God. I was so deeply bitter with
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:30.720]   God for putting that kid in my life. Because you see, God ruined me. God ruined my life
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:39.840]   through that boy. But thank God for his grace and mercy. Thank God for his grace and mercy
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:45.040]   for sinners like me, because I'm at a place now, I'm at a place now where I thank God
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:52.680]   for the illumination. I thank God for Jackson. He still drives me up the wall, don't get
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:58.880]   me wrong. But I love that kid to death. I wouldn't trade it for the world. And I thank
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:03.120]   God for choosing me to be his daddy because of what that little boy has taught me. And
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:08.080]   Jackson more than anything or anyone, and I'm being totally serious about this, that
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.920]   little boy more than anyone or anything has taught me the beauty and the power of the
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:17.120]   gospel. You see, I look at Jackson, I see the cross. I really do. I look at that boy
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:21.520]   and I see the cross. You say, "How?" Here's how. It's at the cross that I see that the
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:28.160]   very thing that I can't stand in my son wasn't me. It's at the cross that I see my own outburst,
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.480]   my own brokenness, my own tantrums, my own meltdowns. It's at the cross that I see how
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:40.000]   traumatized I was by sin, how I was controlled by my own sinful impulses. But it's at the
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.800]   cross that I see the amazing love of God, the love that saw value in me, that saw beauty
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:51.320]   in me and came after me, the love that never gave up on me no matter how much I ran from
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:55.840]   God and rebelled against him. No, he came for me and he found me and he brought me to
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:02.280]   himself and he loved me as his own. And when you realize what took place at the cross,
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:10.800]   it makes sense. It makes sense why God would call us to love the unlovable and care for
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:18.080]   the uncontrollable. The ones that this world says are unadoptable. Because when you are
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:23.600]   driven by the cross, you realize, you realize you are not a rescuer. Listen, we are not
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:30.280]   a group of altruistic people out to save these poor little orphans. That is not who we are.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:36.960]   We are not the rescuers. We are the rescued. We are the, that's who we are. We are the
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:44.120]   ones that have been rescued, saved from far, far worse. And when you get that, it makes
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:53.640]   sense why God would call us to love the hurting and the broken, the most vulnerable among
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:32:01.800]   us. I want to be careful here. I don't want to paint a horrible picture of adoption. That
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:07.880]   is not why I'm here. That's the last thing I want to do. Because truth is, there are
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:14.120]   a lot of awesome, wonderful cases, man, where the adoptive children are great, the adoptive
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:20.040]   families are great, and those kids grow up to play shortstop for some baseball team.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:25.200]   There are plenty of cases like that. There really are. At the same time, I know there
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:31.480]   are a lot of families, and I know many of them, that will tell you of the hardships
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:36.840]   and the challenges that come with adoption. A couple of years ago, I had the privilege
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:41.880]   of being part of a pastor's panel at a conference put together by the Christian Alliance for
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:50.520]   Orphans, a great organization. But that experience changed me. I'd never been more humbled in
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:59.320]   my entire life, because that week I walked among giants. I walked among giants. I walked
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:05.280]   among some of the greatest unsung heroes of our faith. Over 1,700 men and women who quietly,
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.160]   unassumingly cared for the most vulnerable children in our world with no fanfare, no
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:16.560]   applause, no recognition, nothing. I'm talking about people who've taken children into teens.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:27.760]   I don't mean teenagers. People adopt 13, 14, 15 kids. People who've taken the dying.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.040]   Jean and I attended this workshop, and it was by this older couple. They were probably
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:36.400]   in their 60s, 70s. But guys, they had this ministry. They just took in children who were
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:44.280]   terminally ill. Children that were dying, just so that they could comfort them with
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:54.760]   the love of God as they died. Who does that? Who does that? I'll tell you, people who are
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:34:01.200]   driven by the cross. People who understand that they themselves have been rescued, and
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:05.160]   that they themselves have been loved by a far, far greater love. And that's why they
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:10.120]   do what they do. And that's why we do what we do. And that's why we love and we live
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:16.240]   differently from this world. And that's why James 1, 27 makes sense. Why the mark of true
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.480]   Christ-centered, gospel-centered, gospel-driven religion is to care for orphans, because that
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:27.880]   was us. That was us. That was you. That was me. And now God calls us to do the same for
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:34.560]   others. There are over 147 million orphans in the world right now. If there were a country,
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:39.840]   they'd be the seventh largest country in the world. Children who have no one to call, there
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:44.240]   are no mom, no dad. And this isn't just a global crisis. There's an orphan crisis here
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:48.800]   in America. More than 800,000 children pass through the foster care system every year
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:53.200]   here in America, bouncing from one house to another because they are not wanted. And when
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:35:01.480]   they turn 18, they age out. They age out. And every year, 30,000 kids age out of the
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:13.520]   foster care system with nothing but a check and a good luck. That's it. And yet every
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:22.560]   year, only a tiny fraction of Christians open the door of their homes and their hearts to
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:32.120]   these children. If you ask me, there's something wrong. There's something wrong with that.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:37.040]   There's something wrong with that picture. Brothers and sisters, you and I have been
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:48.040]   given so much. We've been given so much. We've been given so much. But far too often, we
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:57.000]   in the church, we squander God's blessings on ourselves, forgetting that we are on mission.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:05.280]   God put us on this earth to proclaim and portray the beauty and the power of the gospel. And
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.400]   that's why James says, "Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father exists
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:13.280]   to visit orphans and widows in their affliction." And then what does he say? "To keep oneself
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:18.120]   unstained from the world." To keep oneself unstained from the world. That's not separate
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:22.080]   from what he just said about caring for orphans and widows. They go hand in hand. And what
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.800]   James is saying here is this. Don't miss this. "What is of great concern to God will be of
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:32.280]   no concern to you when you are corrupted by the world." What is of great concern to God
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:38.480]   will be of no concern to you when you are corrupted by the world. When your values are
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:44.280]   shaped by the world, things like caring for orphans will not matter much to you. So James
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:50.360]   here is issuing a warning. Be careful. Be careful not to be conformed to this pattern, to the
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:55.920]   pattern of this world, because when that happens, you're going to miss the heart of religion,
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:04.440]   pure religion. You will miss the heart of God. But I thank God that this church has
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:09.440]   it. Marie and I thank, I thank God, I thank God for you guys. I thank God that this church
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:16.000]   gets it. You guys get the gospel. And you guys are actively seeking out ways to live
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.560]   out the gospel in your lives and in this community and in this world. I praise God for you. I
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:34.800]   praise God for this church. There's a deeply theological movie called Nacho Libre. I asked
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:41.840]   this the first service, and I'm going to ask it. Who here has not seen Nacho Libre? All
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:48.480]   right, listen, part of your assignment this week, apart from praying about how you might
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:53.000]   be involved in orphan care, is to go on Netflix and watch Nacho Libre. It's one of the best
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.800]   movies ever made, for reals. One of the best movies ever made. But the movie's about Nacho,
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:04.480]   a friar, who moonlights as a wrestler, right? And that's how he raises the funds to care
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:09.160]   for the orphans. There's this one scene where he's talking to his friend, Steven, about
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:14.720]   his desire to care for orphans, and Steven goes, "I'm tired of hearing about the stupid
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:20.880]   orphans. I hate the orphans." And Nacho goes, "What did you say?" And he says it again, "I
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:25.640]   hate all the orphans in the whole world." And Nacho responds, "I'm not listening to you.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:30.400]   You only believe in science. That's probably why we never win." To which Steven says, "We
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:43.120]   never win because you are fat." Great movie. Great, great movie. No one says, "I hate all
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:51.920]   the orphans." I've never heard anybody say that, and I never will. That's not the issue
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:39:02.080]   for us. The issue is not that we hate orphans. The issue is that most of us aren't sufficiently
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:08.240]   motivated to do something about their plight. Guys, what I've come to tell you today is
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:16.600]   that we, we the redeemed, we the adopted sons and daughters of God, we of all people, we
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:22.360]   of all people have all the motivation we need to do something about it. Why? Because we
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:31.040]   are people of the gospel. That's who we are. That's what defines us. And the gospel compels
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:39.160]   us to go out, go out and do for these vulnerable children what God in his mercy has done for
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:45.120]   us. Amen? Amen. Let's pray.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:45.960]   Thank you.
