[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   right? They don't receive any kind of honor in the church. He said the church should
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.440]   not look like the world, right? Church, it neutralizes whatever pride, whatever
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.740]   ambition that you had before you met Christ, you come to church and all of a
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.400]   sudden we get reoriented to what is good and what is bad. That's what he's saying.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.200]   This community should not look like lunchtime in high school, right? So he
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.800]   says we give them special honor because they need it. We bestow more abundant
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.680]   honor. Our less presentable members become much more presentable, whereas
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.400]   our more presentable members have no need of it. But God has so composed the
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.400]   body, giving more abundant honor to that member which lacked, so that there may be
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.240]   no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.040]   another. And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. If one
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.960]   member is honored, all the members rejoice, right? That we are to be one so
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.320]   much to the point we genuinely suffer when other people suffer. When we're
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.440]   distant, we stiff-arm everybody. We kind of, when somebody suffers, it's like, "Oh, too
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.280]   bad. Oh, thumbs down." And that's about the degree of empathy that you show because
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.760]   you don't have any connection with that person. When they rejoice, it's like, "Oh,
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.460]   great, great." And that's about it. But he says, "No." He says, "Be so connected to the
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.080]   church that when one person suffers, that we all suffer together, right?" And as the
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.520]   church gets bigger, when we were a smaller church, this was easier because
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.980]   there was a lot more interaction, right? But as the church gets bigger, all the
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.880]   more why we need to be deliberate about this because it doesn't happen
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.800]   automatically in a bigger church, right? We have to make an effort. You yourself
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.720]   are not gonna get to know everybody in the church, but if everybody makes an
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.200]   effort to do this, right, if everybody practices this, then the community of the
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.640]   church will look very different, right? Where we want to be a community, whether
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.940]   we are a thousand, whether we are ten thousand, that when somebody suffers, we
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.720]   suffer together. When somebody rejoices, we learn to rejoice together, and we can't
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.200]   do that if we ignore the gathering of the church, okay? Discussion question. How has
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.400]   your current walk with God either helped or hindered your fellowship with others?
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.600]   When was the last time you gave up your freedom for the purpose of building up
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.300]   someone else's faith? Do you have a difficult time addressing someone else's
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.320]   sin, right? How do you know when you are being judgmental versus being careful to
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.080]   restore a struggling Christian? That's a very practical question, right? Like some
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.600]   people say, "I'm speaking the truth," right? Somebody needs to speak up, but how do you
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.960]   know when you are more of speaking truth and not love? Or you got
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.540]   somebody else saying like, "Oh, but we need to be more gracious and loving," but you
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.120]   never confront sin. How do you balance this where you're doing, you're speaking
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.240]   the truth in love, right? Because true fellowship requires both. Then four, when
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.080]   was the last time you experienced true biblical fellowship according to what
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.880]   was taught today, right? Where it is Christ-centered, other-centered, holiness
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.440]   producing, right? And building up the body of Christ. What can you do to facilitate
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.800]   genuine fellowship with other members of Berean? So wherever you may be, you may be
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.560]   sitting and saying, "Oh, Berean, oh, I'm Berean," right? Most frustrating person is when
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.040]   their happiness is based upon other people changing. That person will be
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.280]   frustrated all their life. Because as soon as one problem gets fixed, they're
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.160]   gonna find someone else that needs to be fixed. So if your joy is based upon other
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.440]   people and something outside of you changing for you to be joyful, you will
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:49.920]   never be joyful, right? Application should always be with me. So if I want to see
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.560]   biblical fellowship, don't say, "The church needs to do this, the church needs to do
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.240]   that." What do you need to do, right? What do you need to do to affect the
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.200]   fellowship around you? So that's question number four, okay? Let me pray for us
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:10.000]   and then I'll let you get into your group. Father, we pray that your Word that you
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.600]   taught us would bear fruit in our hearts and I pray that the discussion would
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.840]   lead to a greater surrender of ourselves and to look out for others and consider
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.320]   others better than ourselves, that Christ may be exalted, that the church may be
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.880]   built according to your purpose and will. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:30.880]   Hey, did you guys get the email with the slides? I heard that you couldn't see it. Is that true? The slide works but is it all in white with white background?
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:41.880]   [inaudible]
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.880]   But most people are going to see it through their phones though. Okay, all right, okay.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.880]   [inaudible]
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.880]   It works but...
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:06:21.880]   [inaudible]
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:22.880]   [silence]
