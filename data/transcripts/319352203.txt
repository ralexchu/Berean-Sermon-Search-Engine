[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.000]   there. So let her know and she'll give you more information for that.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.320]   All right. If you can turn your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 1. Peter read all the way
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.360]   to 14, but I'm going to be mainly focused on verse 7, 8, and 9 today. So let me read
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:45.680]   that passage. Hebrews chapter 1, verses 7, 8, and 9. "And of the angels," he says, "who
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.120]   makes his angels winds and his ministers a flame of fire? But of the son," he says, "your
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.640]   throne, O God, is forever and ever. And the righteous scepter is the scepter of his kingdom.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.200]   You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness. Therefore, God, your God, has anointed you
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:12.960]   with the oil of gladness above your companions." Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.040]   for the privilege to be able to call you our Abba Father. We pray that your word would
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.080]   have its effect on our hearts. May it bear fruit, may it convict, may it encourage and
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.800]   strengthen. I pray that your intent, your very breath, would have its effect, that our
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.000]   church may be strengthened, and to be better worshipers as a result. I pray for your blessing,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.840]   Lord God, over this time. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.000]   As we've been talking about in the book of Hebrews, the author begins by saying, "Pay
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.960]   attention to Jesus. He's better than the prophets." We've been talking about how he's better than
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.560]   the angels, and all of it to conclude in chapter 2, where he says, "Therefore, we must pay
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.920]   very close attention so we do not drift." We've been talking last week that this is
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.040]   part two of this same text in verse 4 to verse 14, how Jesus is superior to the angels, how
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.520]   he is above them. He's not just slightly above, it says, the first thing that he says, he
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:27.680]   narrated a much more excellent name than the angels, that's very nature of who he is, is
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.640]   much higher than any other name. And then in verse 6 he says the angels were actually
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.200]   called to worship Jesus. Today we're going to be looking at third and fourth argument,
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.160]   and next week we're going to be looking at the fifth and sixth argument. But this question
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:52.280]   of, "Is Jesus better?" is a question that every Christian has to ask repeatedly over
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.960]   and over again in different periods of our life. I remember when I first decided and
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.500]   was wrestling with the idea of going into ministry, one of the first things that I wrestled
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:10.940]   with was I had to let go of all the promises that I made to my parents. My dad was a pastor
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.260]   and we moved around a lot, and financially it was always tough. I can't remember a single
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.560]   year after coming to the United States where it wasn't tough financially. So I remember
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.240]   growing up thinking, "When I get older, I'm going to be a successful businessman," and
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.880]   we would make promises like a lot of young kids do, say, "We're going to buy you a limousine,
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.920]   we're going to buy you a house. Once we get older, we're going to take care of you," and
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.980]   we would make these promises. And I really meant it in my heart that once I got older
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:48.240]   and got a job that I was going to provide. So when I decided to go into ministry, that
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.320]   was the first thing that I had to wrestle with. "Is Jesus better than my parents?" Because
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.880]   I had to let that go. Few years later, back inside, when we were in college ministry,
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.920]   it was the first time in Biola I ever felt like I belonged anywhere as a Christian, and
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.680]   even as a non-Christian, because we moved around somewhere so much. And so when I had
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.080]   a group of friends that we were doing ministry together in this campus ministry, again, that
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.160]   was the first time I ever felt like I was part of a community. About seven, eight months
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.480]   into it, something happened in the ministry and all of my friends, I mean, I'm talking
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.080]   about every single one of them, all of my peers ended up leaving the ministry. And that's
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.600]   why even to this day, my former roommates are all 10 plus years older than me, because
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.320]   all of my peers left. And I remember at that time wrestling with the idea that I wanted
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.120]   to go too, because there's nobody my age here. And I was wrestling with that, and said, "If
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:52.320]   I move because they moved, if I do things because they did it, then I will always be
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.600]   bound to whatever my peers are doing." And I had to ask that question again. Is Jesus
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:05.880]   better than your friends? Is he better than your peers? Different stages in life, we have
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.400]   different questions that we have to answer. You get married, you fall in love, and a lot
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.120]   of people get distracted during that period, and then they were doing fine while they were
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.640]   single, but once they get married, they begin to drift away. And that's another question
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:29.120]   I had to ask. Is Jesus better than your wife? After having children, I never was tempted,
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.920]   again, about like, I don't have elaborate taste, I mean, there's not a single name brand
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:41.520]   on my body, and I don't have any desire for that kind of stuff. But when I had kids, it
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.160]   was first time I felt tempted, like I wanted some money. And it wasn't to buy a big house,
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.480]   it was just I wanted a car with air conditioning, because I was driving a pickup truck and had
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.720]   no air conditioning, and my first kid, we're in the car and he was sweating bullets driving
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.200]   to LA, and it was the first time I thought to myself, "I wish I had more money, so I
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:08.320]   can get a better car, so that my baby could be in an air-conditioned car." And I remember
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.040]   wrestling with that, with those thoughts and temptation, asking myself, "Is Jesus better
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:20.160]   than your kids?" Whatever stage of life that you're in, that's a question that you will
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:28.280]   have to answer repeatedly. Is he better than your career? Is he better than the bank account?
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:35.120]   Is Jesus better than your wife? Is he better than your kids? Is he better than your safety?
[00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:42.520]   Whatever it is, if at any point in your life that question comes up, and you answer, "No.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:48.400]   No, these are better. Jesus means a lot to me, but my wife means more to me. Jesus means
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.960]   a lot to me, but my kids mean more to me." At some point, whatever is better than Jesus
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:59.040]   is gonna cause you to drift. You're gonna first drift in your thinking, and then you're
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.800]   gonna start drifting with your heart, and then eventually you're gonna drift with your
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:10.360]   feet. 'Cause that's usually how it works. A lot of times, again, if we were living in
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.560]   a persecuted country, if you start drifting, you have no need to come to church. But because
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:22.280]   we live in Orange County, you can drift and be so far away and still be active in the
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:29.600]   church. Maybe become Sunday school teachers. But you know in your heart, Christ hasn't
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:37.000]   been at the center of your heart for a very long time. That you've drifted. Christ is
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.360]   no longer your pursuit. And you no longer even ask that question, "Is Jesus better?"
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.840]   Because you've compromised that many, many years ago, and you've drifted. See, this whole
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:55.560]   letter of Book of Hebrews is written to address that issue. They are drifting. At one point,
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.400]   they were passionate. At one point, they were sacrificial. But eventually, the persecution
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.960]   got to them. By the time the gospel got to the second, third generation, they were beginning
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:11.320]   to drift back into their old life, which to them happened to be Judaism. To us, it's just
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:20.240]   whatever pattern of life that is around us. Is Jesus better? So he's been talking about
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.880]   how he's better than the prophets, so therefore we need to pay close attention. He's better
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:29.800]   than the angels, and he starts from the very top. The third argument that he will give
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:35.880]   is Jesus is better than angels because he's the creator. And the angels are just servants.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:43.400]   In other words, it wouldn't make any sense to be tempted to worship angels or to honor
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:50.440]   them while you're drifting away from Christ. In verse 7, "And of the angels," he says,
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:57.160]   "who makes his angels' winds and his ministers a flame of fire?" In other words, that means
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:03.120]   a rhetorical question. Of course God. God is the one who does this. But it can also
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:10.040]   be asked as an actual question. Who? Who makes them? The word for "make," if you guys remember
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:15.040]   last week, there's two separate words for "make." One is "poieo." Another one is "genomai."
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.840]   The word "poieo" basically means to make something out of nothing. It's to create something.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:26.200]   The word "genomai" is to have some form and be transformed to another form. So when you
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:32.640]   and I become Christians, we weren't made into a Christian. We became Christians. We were
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.760]   not Christians, and we became Christians. That's the word that is used to describe Jesus,
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:44.600]   who humbled himself but became exalted. He wasn't created, but he was exalted. The word
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:52.840]   that is used here of the angels is "poieo," to create. So the natural question is, if
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:11:00.520]   they were made, they were created, who created them? And the answer is obvious. In Colossians
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:06.400]   1:16 it says, "For by him," speaking of Jesus, "all things were created both in heaven and
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.880]   on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities. All
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:18.400]   things have been made, have been created through him and for him." Not only did he create them,
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:25.720]   he created them for himself. Hebrews chapter 1 10, "And you Lord, in the beginning, laid
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:31.160]   the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of your hands." Now, the reason
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:37.520]   why he starts with the angels is because even the angels, even the angels were created by
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:47.280]   him and for him. They are ministers for Jesus. They are servants and messengers for Jesus.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:54.200]   And whenever we thwart that authority, it is a rebellion against the Creator. Let me
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:12:00.360]   give you an example, okay, to help us understand lordship of Christ and what he is trying to
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:05.480]   say here. Those of you guys who are with us at the other building, not this building but
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:10.760]   the other building, it was maybe about seven years ago, we were all excited and we were
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:16.400]   building a new building. First time our church, we were nomads wandering and then we finally
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.640]   had a place that's going to have our own. And we were all excited and it took us maybe
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.600]   about eight to nine months for the construction. And at the end of the construction, after
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.360]   all the structural things were done, they were making the stage, but the stage wasn't
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:35.800]   necessarily drawn out. So one day I showed up to the building while the contractors were
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:41.120]   working and he said, "Hey, Pastor Peter, you need to get involved." And I said, "What
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.440]   do I need to get involved in?" He said, "The architect has very specific things that he
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:50.600]   wants on the stage and we're wondering if you agree with that." And I looked at it and
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.320]   he said, "No, I mean, this is very strange." So he didn't have the actual, like the drawing
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.440]   of the, he has just a structural part of it. And then I looked at what he wanted to do
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:05.580]   and he was making a stage into this weird oval shape where it was protruding on one
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:10.000]   side and then going deep on the other side. It's kind of like the Korean flag. You know
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.160]   what I mean? And I don't know why, he wasn't even Korean, but he was making this half wave.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.840]   And even the contractors were thinking like, "This is kind of strange." And he said they
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.880]   were going back and forth and the architect obviously has authority over the contractor
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.320]   and he says, "No, this is what I want." And so I show up and he said, "Hey, you're the
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.280]   contractor here, can you talk to the contractor?" So I found out what was going on and I started
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:39.080]   talking to the contractor and I said, "You know, this is kind of weird." And I said,
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.920]   "Where would I be preaching on this?" And he said, "You should be preaching in the corner
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:49.120]   over there on the side." And those of you who know me, I'm very particular about being
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:56.120]   symmetrical. Okay? That's something that's weird, but if something is not centered, it
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.080]   bothers me. So some of you guys may notice that if I see the pulpit a little bit crooked,
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:05.720]   I'll come and fix it before I come up here. Or even this mat, if it's not centered, I'll
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:10.640]   fix the mat before I start preaching because it bothers me. So whenever we set up the chairs,
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:16.200]   I make sure that it's centered. Anyway, it's weird, but that bothers me. But he had me
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:21.280]   preaching on the side and he never asked me about it and I said, "I can't do that. I need
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.040]   to preach in the middle." And then he was arguing with me and he said, "You're a young
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:31.000]   church." Young church, that's how the old churches have it. He said, "Young church needs
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   to be hip and I know your church is young, so young church wants this." And I said, "No.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.200]   Our church may be young, but we don't want that." And I was telling him, "I need to be
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.160]   in the middle." And I was just going back and forth with him and I could tell he was
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.960]   really being annoyed. And one thing that I learned through the years just working with
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:58.240]   architects and kind of artsy people, right? Some of you guys are really artsy. You're
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:04.320]   very particular about whatever work you did. You don't want anybody to change the color
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:09.920]   or you don't want anybody to change the design. This is your thing. This is your creation
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:15.960]   and you don't want anybody to touch it. I realize architects are engineers who really
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:22.960]   have a bent toward art. So they're very particular about their design. So I understood that.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:29.720]   This is like his imprint on this church. And he was well-meaning. He wanted to help us,
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:34.080]   but he insisted that it had to be this way. And then obviously because he was coming out
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.640]   so strong, I said, "No, we're not going to have it this way. I'm not going to stand on
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.920]   the side on the top of the wave every week just being distracted. That's just not going
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:49.720]   to happen." So he ended up changing the design, just kicking and screaming pretty much. And
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:56.720]   then he got annoyed. The leaders know about this. And then everything was done. He redid
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.720]   the design and it was all centered. Some of you guys remember what that building looked
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:08.160]   like. But after about two, three months, somebody pointed out to me that the stage was not centered.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:13.880]   Some of you guys did not know that. And the stage was skewed maybe about two feet to the
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:20.880]   left. So every Sunday it bothered me. Every Sunday. Because I know I was centered, but
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:26.760]   I knew the stage was not. So the whole room was symmetrical, but I was always standing
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.240]   on the side and always like I knew it in the back of my mind. And I never got to ask him
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:38.200]   why he did that. In my mind I think maybe he was angry. He was just being spiteful.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:43.520]   Or maybe it was just a mistake. But for whatever the reason, he insisted that it had to be
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:49.080]   a certain way. Now the reason why I tell you this story is because we're the owners. We
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:54.560]   hired you. And yes, you have an opinion, but we hired you to make certain things because
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:00.760]   we're going to be using it. We paid you to work for us. It doesn't make sense for you
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:07.760]   to demand your preference on us. What the author here is saying is God is the creator.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:14.960]   Jesus is the creator and he made the angels. If he made the angels to serve him, of course
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:21.880]   he made us to serve him. And it is no different than the creation basically telling the creator,
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:28.880]   this is my opinion. This is what I think. I know what you want, but this is what I want.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:36.880]   And it is a royal rebellion for us who have been created for the purpose of his glory
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:42.400]   to say, no, I don't think that's what I want. And the scripture says all have sinned and
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:47.360]   fall short of the glory of God because we were all in rebellion giving our opinion to
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:54.360]   the creator. I want this, but I don't want that. And he's saying Jesus is above even
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:18:01.720]   the angels. Of course he created us for the same purpose. See, scripture says clearly
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:11.000]   that the angels were created and even the word angel means a messenger. The word gospel
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   in itself basically means good message. The same word, root word for angel, angelos, is
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:25.160]   the end word for evangelion, good message. Ultimately all for the purpose of serving
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:33.760]   our creator. Not only were we created for that, he says he himself in verse 8, he's
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:39.080]   the king who sits on the throne where all of us are under his throne, his subjects.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:44.080]   Look with me in verse 8 what he says. Remember I told you chapter 1 of the book of Hebrews
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:49.520]   is the chapter that caused me to open my eyes toward the trinity? Well in the chapter, verse
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:56.200]   8 is the key verse. Verse 8 it says, "But of the son he says, 'Your throne, O God, is
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:01.640]   forever and ever and the righteous scepter, the scepter of his kingdom.'" Who is speaking
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:08.640]   here? Look at that verse. Who's speaking? When he says, "But of the son he says," who's
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:17.560]   the he? Some of your Bibles already kind of highlighted it for you, right? Who's the he?
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:24.320]   Yes, God the Father. God the Father is the one who's speaking because the previous verse
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:29.320]   and the of the angels he says, he's talking about again God the Father because God the
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:35.280]   Father is saying, made you, but he says of the son. So God the Father is speaking of
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:42.280]   the son and what does he say? "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever." God the Father
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:51.000]   is speaking about his son and he addresses him as God who's on the throne forever. And
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.840]   I remember reading this for the first time, like how can anybody read this and think that
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:02.840]   Jesus is anything but equal to God? This is the verse that I usually turn to when I talk
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.960]   to Jehovah's Witnesses because if you open up their New Kingdom translation, this is
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:13.200]   what it says in the New World Translation. I think I have it over here in the bottom.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:19.080]   But about the son he says, "God is your throne forever and ever and the scepter of your kingdom
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:26.080]   is the scepter of uprightness." It was deliberately mistranslated so that it doesn't say the same
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:31.160]   thing that our translation says. So whether you have the NASB, NIV, ESV, or King James,
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:36.080]   whatever translations you have, it will all say, "God the Father speaking of his son,
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.800]   your throne, O God, is forever and ever." But in the New World Translation it says,
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:46.640]   "Of the son he says, God is your throne." So the subject is no longer God speaking to
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:51.560]   God, but God speaking to someone lesser and saying, "God is your throne." Now I've had
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:56.680]   so many conversations with Jehovah's Witnesses about this. I've been on campus talking to
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.320]   them, opening up the scriptures and saying, "You know what?" Because they claim that they
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:08.000]   translated their Bible out of the same Greek manuscript as the NIV. So I said, "How can
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.920]   this be the same translation?" So either you got it wrong or we got it wrong. And I would
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:20.480]   usually have the conversation, "So if we can prove an independent Greek scholar come and
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:25.960]   says that your translation is wrong, will you admit that your Bible is unreliable?"
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:31.920]   Because it was deliberately translated wrong. I've never had anybody say to me, "Yes." Because
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:38.920]   they know what that means. It means that everything that they're basing their faith on is unreliable.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.880]   And I said, "I'm willing. If you can prove that my translation was deliberately butchered,
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.240]   I will admit that everything I confess to you because it's coming out of this book is
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:53.720]   suspect. Are you willing to admit that? And if we admit that, let's go do some research."
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:22:04.040]   I've never had anybody say, "Yes." Because it's not the truth that is founded upon. The
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:10.040]   group mentality is so powerful. And you don't want to question the group because it means
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.160]   there's consequences that comes from questioning the group. And so if we're not careful, what
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:20.700]   ends up happening is we pursue the community and we work hard to belong. But at some point,
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:31.080]   we stop pursuing truth. Scripture clearly says, "Christ is God." Jesus himself said
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:37.960]   this in John 10.30, "I and the Father are one." John 10.33, "The Jews answered him,
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:43.220]   'For a good work we do not stone you, but for blasphemy. And because you being a man,
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:49.560]   make yourself out to be God.'" It was clearly stated by Christ. It's clearly stated in the
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:54.640]   Hebrews. It's clearly stated in the Gospels. And even the Jews heard clearly that Jesus
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:03.640]   was not simply saying, "I am like God." "You being a mere man are claiming to be God himself."
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:11.320]   So why would you drift toward anything else? And as fundamental as that question is, that
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:19.800]   is the question that we wrestle with in different stages in life. Is Jesus better? Is Jesus
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:27.600]   better than your career? Is Jesus better than your bride? Is Jesus better than your wife?
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.720]   Is Jesus better than your future? Is Jesus better than your retirement? Whatever it is
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:38.440]   that we hang our comfort in, is Jesus better? And obviously, the answer is, of course not.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:47.160]   Jesus is God. Fourthly, he said, "Jesus is greater than the angels because Jesus was
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:53.000]   anointed above the angels, because he loved righteousness and hated lawlessness." I mean,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.200]   he's talking about Jesus' humanity. When he was humbled, God exalted him to the highest
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:05.960]   place because he says he loved righteousness and he hated lawlessness. Before we move
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.120]   on about this, it's like, "Yeah, I see he loved righteousness." But I want to take a
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:16.440]   few minutes to talk about what this means. Because righteousness sounds very different
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.600]   to different people and different culture and different times. What seemed righteous
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.760]   in the previous generation seems unrighteous in this generation. What seems righteous in
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:30.440]   one culture seems unrighteous in another culture. So we have to be careful that our understanding
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:40.040]   of righteousness is biblical, not because of where we grew up. Let me give you an example
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:45.960]   of that. Obviously, I'm bicultural. I was born in Korea, I came when I was young, and
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:51.600]   so I'm kind of between two cultures like I know many of you are. But when I was serving
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.360]   in the Korean... By culture, by nature, I'm more Westernized because I spent the majority
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:02.560]   of my life in the West. But I understand the Korean culture, the Asian culture. But I didn't
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:09.560]   realize how Westernized I was until I was serving in the Korean church. And I had a
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.000]   youth... I was the EM pastor and one of our youth pastors were giving a message to our
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.380]   youth group students. And one of the older deacons of the church, and he must have been
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:25.940]   probably maybe in his 70s, he walked in right in the middle of the service and he grabbed
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:31.320]   the music stand that the youth pastor was preaching off of and he started walking out
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:38.280]   of the room. And so obviously I said, "What is he doing?" And so I grabbed the pulpit,
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:42.000]   I put it back and I told him, "Hey, just keep going, I'll deal with this." And I took him
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:50.480]   outside and I started scolding him. And I said, "Deacon so-and-so, you can't do this.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:56.480]   This is a worship just because they're kids. It's not less of a worship. And if you come
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:01.880]   in here and you take a pulpit, on a pulpit that the pastor is preaching out of, what
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:07.940]   message do you think that gives the kids? That they're not valuable, their worship isn't
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:13.680]   as good as the older people just because they're young." And I was just scolding him, I was
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:18.500]   upset and I said, "You shouldn't be doing this and no wonder why Korean American kids
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:24.400]   are leaving church because you don't respect them and you're ruining the worship." And
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:29.520]   this whole thing is like, "Because I'm righteous. I'm speaking on God's behalf. He needs to
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:35.000]   be rebuked." And as I was scolding him, and he didn't fight back, he knew what he did
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.860]   was wrong. And as I was scolding him, I was trying to calm myself down. And then the adult
[00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:44.120]   service just finished. And they didn't know the context, they didn't know what happened.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:53.360]   All they saw was this young punk, hot-headed EM pastor scolding this old man. And so they
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.520]   go, "What is going on?" So they pulled me aside, "Pastor Peter, what happened?" And
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:02.840]   I explained to them the situation. And the response that they gave me was, "Yeah, you
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:08.000]   know, he shouldn't have done that. That's not right. But what you did was worse." And
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.880]   I go, "What are you talking about? I'm speaking for God. This is worship. I'm protecting our
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:23.840]   kids." But I realized that in the Korean culture, that's a greater sin to dishonor the older
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.200]   people. And so whatever mistake that he made, they acknowledged that, but he said, "What
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:33.600]   you did was far worse because you embarrassed him in front of the church." It took me a
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:39.800]   long time to digest that. It took me a long time to digest that. Like, why would... Because
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:46.960]   my mindset is Western. And so in the Western culture, we have a tendency to rely on contracts,
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.360]   right? And what is right and what is wrong. And when somebody breaks that, that's unrighteous
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.320]   and we need to deal with that. And that's why we go on the streets, we protest, we shame
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:00.480]   people who break laws and we do all of this stuff. But in the Eastern culture, it is a
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:07.840]   greater sin. And universally, they will look at that as a greater sin. That's why in the
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:13.980]   Asian culture, they don't consider you mature when you become independent. They consider
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:19.480]   you mature when you become mature enough to acknowledge your elders. You know what I'm
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:27.640]   talking about? If you don't, it's because you're Western. And I realized that in these
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:34.880]   two separate cultures, what offends one culture is honored in another culture, and what is
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:40.520]   honored in one culture is offended in another culture. So we have to be very careful that
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:47.040]   we don't project what you and I think of righteousness, and that we are careful that what we consider
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:52.520]   to be righteous is based upon scripture. Jesus himself rebukes the Pharisees. Matthew 23,
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:58.200]   23 says, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:05.940]   cumin and have neglected the weightier matters of the law, justice and mercy and faithfulness.
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.480]   These you ought to have done without neglecting the other, you blind guys, straining out the
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:16.840]   gnat and swallowing a camel." It's not one or the other. He says you need to obey the
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:24.040]   law without neglecting the what? The weightier matter. And what was the weightier matter?
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:32.580]   See, compassion, faithfulness, mercy, justice, these are not tangible things. These are intangible
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:39.520]   things of our heart. And he says, you think you're righteous because you are tithing these,
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:46.500]   even the smallest of these things, but when it comes to weightier things, you are blind.
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:53.240]   When we think of righteousness, majority of Christians automatically feel burdened. We
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.320]   respect it from a distance, but because when we think of righteousness, we automatically
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:03.300]   in the Western world think of what we should do and what we shouldn't do. What did Jesus
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:10.200]   do and what he did not do? Because that's our frame of mind. And so automatically, when
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.840]   we think of righteousness, like what do I have to do? What do I have to sacrifice? Or
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:20.740]   here's some things that I really like to do, but I can't do that. I shouldn't do that.
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:25.840]   But the Bible describes righteousness in a far broader picture. In 1 Timothy 6, 5-6,
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:31.240]   it says, "In constant friction between men and depraved mind and deprived of truth, who
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:36.680]   suppose that godliness is a means of gain. But godliness actually is a means of great
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:45.680]   gain when accompanied by contentment." In other words, he said he's rebuking that generation
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.160]   and saying, "You know, some of these people are practicing righteousness because if they
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:53.600]   practice, if they do the right thing and avoid the wrong thing, that God's going to reward
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:31:01.080]   them." What Paul is saying is godliness in and of itself is the reward. If you understand
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.280]   what godliness is, if you understand what righteousness is, righteousness in and of
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:12.360]   itself is the reward because that's what we lost at the fall. His glory was lost at the
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:17.980]   fall. He's trying to restore us to be righteous. But in the Western world, if we're not careful,
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:23.200]   we practice righteousness so that we can get a reward. We practice righteousness because
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:28.440]   we think it's a means of gain. But Paul is saying, "No. When you understand what righteousness
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:35.400]   is with contentment, it is great gain." 1 John 5, 2-3, "By this we know that we love
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:39.880]   the children of God when we love God and observe his commandments. For this is the love of
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:45.720]   God, that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not burdensome." His commandments
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:54.160]   are not burdensome. Is this true? Is that what you actually think? Again, if we think
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:58.120]   of righteousness as simply as something we do and certain things that we don't do, of
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:04.360]   course it's burdensome. Because you naturally want to do certain things and God's law prevents
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:09.480]   you. There are certain things that you don't want to do and God commands you to do it.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:16.400]   Of course it's burdensome. But what does he mean? If you love God, you obey his commands
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:24.840]   and his commands are not burdensome. Let me give you another example. Are people easy
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:29.240]   to love or hard to love? Don't answer that. I don't want you getting in trouble with your
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:38.100]   neighbors. Okay? Are people easy to love or hard to love? It's hard to answer that question
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:44.480]   because it's too broad. I have to ask the question in more detail. Maybe if I gave you
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:53.160]   a specific name. Is this person hard to love or easy to love? You say, "He's easy to love."
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:58.240]   Why is he easy to love? Because he's always looking out for me, he's always encouraging
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:03.640]   me, he's always doing things for me. You can list all these things. When I think of that
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:08.800]   person, it's easy to love. And then there's, "What about her?" I say, "Well, she's hard
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:15.660]   to love because whenever I'm around her, she makes me feel guilty and she's always ripping
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:21.460]   on me and saying all of these things and so I have to love her." So it's burdensome to
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:31.420]   love her. When he says to love God means to obey his commandments, it is not burdensome,
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:37.340]   not because the commandment in itself is not burdensome, but because of who is giving the
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:44.300]   command. I can honestly tell you, for me, in my life, the person that's easiest to love
[00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:51.420]   is my wife. It doesn't require a lot of work, to be honest. And the reason why is because
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:58.080]   nobody has my back like my wife. Nobody supports me and encourages me and takes care of me.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:02.620]   And of course, when I was younger, my mom played that role, but as a grown man, it's
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:08.980]   my wife. So it's not hard to love my wife. It's not hard to sacrifice for her. It's not.
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:15.940]   It's just because of who she is to me. When he says his commandment is not burdensome,
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:19.540]   he's not saying the commandment in itself is not burdensome, it's not burdensome because
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:28.840]   of the one who's giving the command. Righteousness is being right with God. Righteousness is
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:35.360]   loving God himself. And because it is God who gives the command, it is no longer burdensome.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:41.520]   When you don't know God, when you don't have this affection for God, when God is just this
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:47.960]   figurehead in heaven, everything he commands is going to be burdensome. But when you love
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:52.000]   the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, all of a sudden, you desire
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.720]   it. And you know, every single one of us knows exactly how that feels. You can drive to L.A.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:05.600]   for work and it is two hours of trudging through the traffic. But all of a sudden, you have
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:12.180]   some girl that you fell in love with and she happens to be living in L.A. And your friends
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:19.880]   are telling you, can you stop going to L.A.? Can you just stay in Irvine for a period?
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:26.320]   You can't help yourself. And that drive is not burdensome. It's the reason why you're
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:34.200]   driving that makes that drive burdensome. Righteousness isn't simply doing what's right
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:41.400]   and avoiding what is wrong. That's why he says if you love me, obey my commands. Obeying
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:49.080]   me is loving me. But at the core of it is Christ. At the core of it, it's Christ who
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:55.280]   is exalted. So if Christ is not the center, if Christ is not our pursuit, if Christ is
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:02.240]   not our goal, if Christ is not our love, it just becomes things to do. You missed the
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:07.520]   whole point. That's why he keeps saying that the end conclusion of all of this is chapter
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:13.080]   12. Fix your eyes upon Jesus. And that's what he's doing. We're at the beginning of it.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:18.520]   We're going to spend 11 chapters where he says, listen to Jesus. Look at Jesus. Listen
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:28.160]   to Jesus. Look at Jesus. Because everything that we do hinges upon this. He loved righteousness,
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:34.640]   but he also hated lawlessness. James chapter 4, 4, he said, you adulterous, do you not
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:39.440]   know that the friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore, whoever wishes
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:45.800]   to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. There is no in between. Because
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:50.560]   the world is in rebellion against God, you cannot be friends with the enemy of the one
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:56.280]   that we love. He says he hates lawlessness. John 15, 19, if you were of the world, the
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:00.460]   world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, but I chose you out
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:06.680]   of the world because of this world, because of this the world hates you. The more you
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:12.000]   love something, the more you end up loving what they love. The more you love someone,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:24.040]   the more you begin to hate the things that they hate. He loved righteousness, hated lawlessness.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:29.880]   Therefore it says, Jesus was anointed with all of Godness above his companions. Now I
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:36.240]   want to conclude today's message with this. His throne and his anointing is described
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:47.240]   as anointing of oil of gladness, of joy. This is at the center. This is at the center of
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.960]   what Christ has given us. Because the Bible says that he came to give life and to give
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:56.440]   us life abundantly. He didn't give us, he didn't say I came to give you directions.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:02.160]   He didn't say I came to point you to the right direction. He didn't say I came so that I
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:08.600]   can just deliver you from hell. All of these are benefits. All of these are byproducts.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:14.600]   But he said I came to restore what? Life. Because life was what was lost because of
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:22.520]   sin. So life is what is restored because of his righteousness. But this life is Zoe. It's
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:32.160]   another way of describing joy. And Jesus says I have come to restore this life, this joy.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:38.320]   And that's why over and over again the Bible describes the fruit of our salvation as joy.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.400]   Romans 4, 14, 17. For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking but righteousness,
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:48.680]   peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. Galatians 5, 22. But the fruit of the Spirit is love,
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:53.080]   joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness and faithfulness. You know how we can tell if
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.600]   somebody's going to persevere in their faith? You know, now that I've been a Christian for
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:03.360]   35 plus years, I've seen so many Christians who were on fire for God at one point and
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:07.760]   just kind of walking away in their faith. Now I've seen people saying that they're going
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:13.200]   to become full-time missionaries and are no longer even going to church today. You know,
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:17.160]   made their confession, was active at church, and after five years, ten years, they disappeared.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:23.240]   And there's one thing that I noticed that is consistent with people who endure. They
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:34.120]   do what they do because they're happy. The gospel did not come to us through 2,000 years
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:39.440]   of suffering and persecution because men and women were determined to do the right thing.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:45.200]   You know the difference between hardworking people who are determined and resolved? They'll
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:51.160]   give up their weekend. They'll give up some of their money. They'll help when they can,
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:58.880]   when they have abundance. But they will never give up their life. It is not hard work and
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:05.400]   determination that brought the gospel through 2,000 years of chaos. It's men and women who
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:11.840]   have been affected by the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and they found joy in serving
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:17.800]   and dying for Christ more than anything else in this world. That's what brought the gospel
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:24.720]   here. And it is joy and life that is infectious to the world. It is not our hard work and
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:29.800]   righteousness and good deeds that the world looks at and says, "I want some of that."
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:40.640]   It is worship that they are not able to do. It is worship that has been squashed because
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:46.840]   of their unrighteousness. So are there moral people outside the church? Yes. Are there
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:53.960]   good, honest people outside the church? Yes. That is not unique to us. What is unique to
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:41:04.560]   us is the righteousness of Christ, which is perfect, that covers us, that causes us to
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:13.760]   worship him in spirit and in truth. That's what the world does not have. And so if the
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:19.520]   fruit of our life isn't joy, eventually your mind, your heart, and your feet will eventually
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:27.000]   take you to whatever brings you joy. If you find joy in making money, that's where eventually
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.520]   your body is going to take you. Whatever pleasure, wherever you find comfort, wherever you find
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:42.600]   life, eventually that's where it will take you. But those who are under the dominion
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:50.600]   of the Son, the fruit is gladness. Because he was anointed with gladness, that is what
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:55.220]   we get. Colossians 1:11, "Be strengthened with all power according to his glorious might
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:42:00.240]   for the attaining of all the steadfastness and patience joyously." 1 Peter 1.8, "And
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.760]   though you have not seen him, you love him, and though you do not see him now, but believe
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:12.160]   in him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible, full of glory." Finally John 10, 10 and 11,
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:17.600]   "The thief comes only to steal and to kill and to destroy. I came that they may have
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:23.600]   life and have it abundantly. I am the good shepherd." The good shepherd laid down his
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:31.480]   life for his sheep. Let's fix our eyes upon Christ. The temptation in this world is just
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:39.400]   too great. The distractions, all the little trinkets, all the little things, all the anxieties
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:44.280]   and fears of, "If I don't do this, what if tomorrow?" All of that. You can't combat that
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:52.840]   by determination. Only when you see the beauty of Christ, then all these other things will
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:43:04.560]   become rubbish. Let's take some time to pray as we ask our worship team to come lead us.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:12.600]   This morning, as we pray, and I know this is a broken record, but I'm going to keep
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:21.200]   saying it as long as I'm in the pulpit. There is nothing better than Christ. I told you
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:29.240]   how easy it is to love my wife. She makes it easy. But even my wife does not compare
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:36.960]   to the love of Christ, because she's human. She's incomplete. She's a sinner like me.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:44.420]   There's only one perfect being who's all-powerful, all-knowing, who's capable of providing for
[00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:52.240]   all our needs, loves us as perfectly as Jesus does. Why would we be tempted to go anywhere
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:59.920]   else? Let's take some time to pray and work hard to answer this rest. Let's pray.
