[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.360]   that we get to gather as a church
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.360]   to come in prayer and embrace.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.360]   Father, we thank you for your daily kindness
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.360]   and mercies that sustain us.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.360]   And even tonight, Lord, as we come before you,
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.360]   may you grant us just the strength
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.360]   and the sober-mindedness, Lord,
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.360]   to pray intentionally and to pray deeply
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.360]   to you, Lord, and to seek you.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.360]   Father, if there be any sin in us,
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.360]   may we come before you, Lord,
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.360]   with repentance and humility,
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.360]   and that we would desire purity

[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.360]   and that we would truly desire
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.360]   a pure devotion to you alone.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.360]   So, bless tonight, Lord,
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.360]   and with these praises and the prayers
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.360]   that we bring to you,
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.360]   that it would be a blessing to you, Lord.

[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:46.360]   [gong]
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:50.360]   We're going to have two parts to tonight's prayer time,
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.360]   where the first part is going to be praying for just yourself,
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.360]   by yourself, and then we're going to give a good chunk of time
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.360]   for you to pray, and then the second part of it,
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:03.360]   I'm going to present, we're going to spend the second part of it
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.360]   praying for our mission trip to Korea,
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.360]   and so we have our mission team that are kind of spread out,
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.360]   and during that period, after I give a brief presentation
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.360]   about what's happening out in Korea,
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.360]   we're going to turn around, and not obviously,
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.360]   there's only 20 of us, or 19 of us,
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:24.360]   and so you may be around somebody in the mission team,
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.360]   and so they're going to be--they were asked to share
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.360]   their prayer request before we go out,
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.360]   and so if you're near that group, you're going to be part of that group,
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.360]   and they're going to be sharing, but if for some reason
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.360]   you're not able to do that, we're just going to have you guys
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.360]   in small groups and take some time to pray with each other, okay?
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.360]   Let me pray for us, and then I wanted to go over the necessity of prayer
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.360]   and then give you plenty of time to pray this evening.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:53.360]   Heavenly Father, we pray for greater understanding.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.360]   Lord, as you've called us here to corporately pray
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.360]   and to individually seek you,
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.360]   we ask, Lord God, that you would soften our hearts,
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:05.360]   whatever distractions that we have brought into this room.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:11.360]   Help us, Lord, to put it aside and to truly fix our eyes upon Christ.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:15.360]   We pray, Lord God, that you would help us to be focused.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:20.360]   Help us to have a heart of reverence and anticipation
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:25.360]   and urgency, Lord God, to join with the Holy Spirit, Lord,
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.360]   groaning, Lord God, to desire to see your name be magnified.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.360]   So we pray for guidance and understanding this evening.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.360]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.360]   Can you do me a favor and turn on the light a little bit
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.360]   so I can see people's faces?
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.360]   So if you're falling asleep, I'll know who you are.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:49.360]   All right, so this evening I wanted to go over 10 reasons.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.360]   Obviously, we can give much more than 10 reasons,
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.360]   but there's 10 reasons why we are called to pray.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.360]   So I want to go down that list, and then after we do that,
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.360]   we're going to give you some time to pray on your own
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.360]   before we get into corporate prayer.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:12.360]   Okay, one, we pray to surrender our will to his.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.360]   This is something that every single Christian
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:18.360]   wrestles with all the time, like what is his will for me?
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:23.360]   What is his will for me, whether it is my job or career
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.360]   or direction or relationship or whatever it may be?
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.360]   But before we even ask that question,
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.360]   we need to understand what is his will.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.360]   Are we surrendered to his will before you seek his will
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.360]   specifically for you?
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:41.360]   And so the beginning of prayer, when Jesus says to pray this way,
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.360]   "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.360]   "Thy kingdom come.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.360]   "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.360]   So first and foremost, prayer is seeking God
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.360]   to surrender our will, right?
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.360]   If your will is not surrendered, you cannot pray
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:02.360]   because God is not a servant waiting for us.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.360]   It's like, okay, have you decided what you want?
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.360]   Let me know what you want so I can answer your prayers, right?
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.360]   That's not what prayer is.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.360]   Prayer is seeking him to know his will
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.360]   and then in prayer we are surrendering to his will, right?
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.360]   That's number one.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.360]   So that's why we pray.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.360]   We pray so that we may establish Christ as Lord
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.360]   before anything else, right?
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:30.360]   Number two, we pray to cultivate a heart of Christ, right?
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.360]   You can have the mind of Christ
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.360]   through the study of the Word of God,
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.360]   but you may not know the heart of Christ, right?
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.360]   So heart of Christ is you have to interact with them.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.360]   I mean, you can read books about people,
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.360]   but you really don't understand who they are
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.360]   until you've interacted with them.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.360]   And so our primary way that we interact,
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.360]   we know his will by studying and knowing the Word of God.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:56.360]   But you know the difference between I know that person
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.360]   because I've been told and I've read
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.360]   versus interacting with them.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.360]   So we pray not only to know his will,
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:09.360]   but his heart, right, to build a relationship with this Christ.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.360]   And so we draw near to him.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:15.360]   Number three, we pray to declare our dependence on God,
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:20.360]   to understand that he is our daily bread, right?
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.360]   So every day that goes by that we don't pray,
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.360]   we are living independently of God, right?
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.360]   And there's a reason why he says, "Pray in this way.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.360]   Give us this day our daily bread."
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.360]   Our daily bread is in reference to the Old Testament
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.360]   telling the Israelites to only collect what you needed
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.360]   for tomorrow we will give you enough.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.360]   And so our prayer is a dependence on God.
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.360]   When we come before the Lord,
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.360]   we recognize that everything important in our life
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.360]   ultimately comes from him, right?
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:54.360]   Everything we desire to do ultimately comes from him, right?
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:58.360]   Not my hard work, not my skill, not my wisdom,
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.360]   but depending on him for him to guide us.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.360]   So prayer is to declare our dependence on him.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:07.360]   So again, when we don't pray, we're declaring,
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.360]   whether we want to or not, that I can function without him.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.360]   Whatever I'm doing, I can do without him, right?
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.360]   So prayer is surrender.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.360]   Prayer is cultivation of his heart.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.360]   Prayer is a declaration of dependence on him.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:26.360]   Number four, we pray to increase our faith.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:31.360]   You cannot grow in your walk with God without prayer.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:36.360]   Prayer is what causes God to become real, right?
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.360]   Everything that you read about the Word of God
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.360]   is just theory until you pray.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:45.360]   Until God answers your prayer and you're interacting with God
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.360]   and you're in the throne of grace in prayer,
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.360]   you're learning theology, but it's all theory.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.360]   You're regurgitating information without any power.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.360]   And so you cannot increase in faith.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.360]   How does faith happen?
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.360]   You hear the Word of Christ,
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.360]   but then you see the power of Christ through the Word of Christ
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.360]   when God answers our prayers, right?
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.360]   So when we have a prayerless life,
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.360]   God is just somebody far away in theory.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.360]   We adore him, we can worship him,
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.360]   we can study about him, but you don't know him, right?
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:23.360]   Faith will not increase until you pray, right?
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:28.360]   The greatest testimonies which causes God to seem real to you
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.360]   is when you pray and you know specifically
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.360]   that that was an answer to prayer,
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:38.360]   where the divine touches the man because we pray, right?
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.360]   So our faith is increased.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.360]   So your faith doesn't increase.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:46.360]   It won't increase if you're not interacting with God in prayer.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.360]   We pray to fight against our flesh.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.360]   We pray to fight against our flesh.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.360]   Again, as we depend on God,
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.360]   and because our flesh naturally desires earthly things,
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.360]   when we pray, it is to combat our own flesh.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:06.360]   The discipline of prayer combats our fleshly desire, right?
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:09.360]   Our flesh doesn't lead us to pray.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:13.360]   Our flesh doesn't naturally cause us to think about God.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:18.360]   And so wrestling in prayer is wrestling to buffet our bodies
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:23.360]   and make it our slave, that we may surrender to God in prayer, right?
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.360]   So prayer is an act of surrender,
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:30.360]   and it is an active way to fight against our flesh.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.360]   So when you don't pray,
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.360]   you're just allowing your flesh to take you wherever you want.
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.360]   And the thoughts that you have, the desires that you have,
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:41.360]   are being led by your flesh when you don't pray.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:46.360]   Sixthly, we pray to engage in spiritual battle, right?
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.360]   That our fight is not against flesh and blood.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.360]   So it's everything that you engage in
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.360]   that all you need to do is plan and implement.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.360]   And if you just read the right books
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.360]   and do everything that you're capable of doing,
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.360]   you do not understand that this is a spiritual battle.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:07.360]   You cannot fight demonic forces with fleshly equipment.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.360]   That's why he says we have to pray.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.360]   After you've done all the putting on the full armor of God,
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.360]   he says, "Pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray," right?
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.360]   So prayer is the active engagement of the spiritual battle.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.360]   Again, so which means if you're not praying, right?
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.360]   It doesn't matter what you're doing on the outside.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.360]   You're not engaged in spiritual battle.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.360]   You're learning, you may feel like you're growing,
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.360]   but if you're not praying,
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.360]   you're not engaged in the spiritual battle
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.360]   that he told us that we're in.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.360]   This is not something you can do in the flesh, right?
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.360]   That's why we have to pray.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:44.360]   We pray to grow in love for Christ, right?
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.360]   You cannot love something from a distance, right?
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.360]   You don't fall in love with somebody from a distance.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.360]   You don't appreciate them from a distance.
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.360]   You don't have compassion from a distance.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.360]   So any meaningful relationship happens when you draw near, right?
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.360]   When you get to know them, when you hear their voice,
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:04.360]   you can see how they respond, you can see their personalities.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.360]   And so if you're not drawing near to Christ,
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.360]   again, you are in love with an image of Christ, right?
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.360]   The teaching of Christ, but not Christ himself.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.360]   Christ doesn't become real until you learn how to pray,
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.360]   until you are devoted in your prayers
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.360]   and you're communing in prayer, right?
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.360]   And so our love for Christ grows.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.360]   We need to pray because love for Christ
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.360]   comes in the context of praying and seeking him
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.360]   and interacting with him.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:38.360]   Number eight, we pray to bring glory to God, ultimately.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:41.360]   If you bear any fruit without praying,
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.360]   you will bring glory to yourself, right?
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:49.360]   Because you were smart, because you have experience,
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.360]   because you read a lot of books,
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.360]   because you know theology, because you're gifted,
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.360]   you're articulate, and you have a lot of experience.
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:02.360]   When you don't pray and you think you're bearing fruit,
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.360]   it ultimately does more damage to you
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.360]   because it fills you with pride
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:09.360]   and you bring attention to yourself.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.360]   That if you repeat what I did, if you do what we did,
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.360]   then you may have this fruit too, and that ruins you.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.360]   The moment you touch that glory, it ruins you, right?
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:23.360]   So prayer is surrendering to God,
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.360]   and ultimately you cannot bring glory to God until you pray.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.360]   It doesn't matter how articulate you are.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.360]   It doesn't matter how great your sermons are
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.360]   or how many people you share the gospel with
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.360]   because at the end of the day,
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:38.360]   if you take the credit for that, right, it'll ruin you.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.360]   He said the only person that can bring
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.360]   a complete transformation from a sinner
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.360]   who was destined to hell
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.360]   and now is able to call God his Abba Father
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.360]   is by the Holy Spirit, right?
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.360]   And so he says we need to pray.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.360]   If you are committed to bring glory to God,
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.360]   you have to pray.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.360]   You must pray.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.360]   And no matter how good intending you are,
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:07.360]   your life will always end with pride
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.360]   if you do not pray, right?
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.360]   So a religiously active Christian
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.360]   who does not pray every day,
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.360]   either he's being ruined because he's not praying
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.360]   and he's falling into the scheme of the devil,
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:25.360]   or he thinks he's being successful,
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.360]   but he's also being ruined.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:31.360]   But you're even more blind in the latter
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.360]   because on the surface it looks like you're growing,
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.360]   but you're growing in pride,
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.360]   and it doesn't matter how much knowledge you have.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:43.360]   Pride is the fall of the devil, right?
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.360]   And he said everything in the Bible says
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.360]   do not lay hands hastily.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.360]   Do not let a new believer, right, to be a leader
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:53.360]   because he will fall into the same temptation.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.360]   And even Apostle Paul, as he came in Revelation,
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.360]   he said he had a thorn on his side,
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.360]   and Jesus said, "No, I put that there,
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.360]   "and I'm going to keep it there."
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.360]   Because of so much revelation that was coming through him,
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.360]   he needed to keep Apostle Paul humble
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.360]   because the greatest deterrent
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:15.360]   to Apostle Paul's fruitfulness was his own pride, right?
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:18.360]   So he deliberately put a thorn on his side
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:22.360]   so that he would beg, so that he would need God, right?
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.360]   So when we don't pray,
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.360]   we are begging for the discipline of God
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.360]   because if God loves us,
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:32.360]   he will do his best to keep us humble, right?
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.360]   Because he knows that as soon as pride comes in,
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.360]   we will be ruined, so we have to pray.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.360]   We have to pray.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.360]   If we're going to bring glory to God, we must pray.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:46.360]   Number nine, we pray because Jesus set us an example.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.360]   Because Jesus set us an example.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.360]   Of all the things that the disciples could have asked Jesus
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.360]   and said, "Teach us how to do this,"
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.360]   the disciples didn't say,
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.360]   "Teach us how to walk on the water," right?
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.360]   That'd be a great thing to learn, right?
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.360]   "Teach us how to feed the 5,000."
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.360]   That's not what they asked.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.360]   "Teach us how to open the eyes of the blind."
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.360]   That's not what they asked.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.360]   For some reason, they knew
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.360]   how important prayer was in Jesus' life,
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.360]   so when they had an opportunity to ask him,
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.360]   "Disciple us how to do this,"
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.360]   they said, "Teach us how to pray."
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:21.360]   So clearly, clearly Jesus, by his own example,
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.360]   was declaring to his disciples,
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.360]   the Son of God, how important prayer is.
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:30.360]   And then finally, we pray because God told us to.
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:35.360]   If anything, if we don't even have the other nine,
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.360]   number 10 is enough because God said so.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.360]   That's it, right?
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.360]   We don't need to know why.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.360]   We don't need to know the effect.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.360]   We don't need to know the problem, right?
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:49.360]   All we need to know is God told us to, right?
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.360]   And he's not going to tell us to do something,
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:54.360]   you know, that we don't need.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.360]   And repeatedly, over and over and over and over again
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.360]   in the Bible, it says to pray,
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.360]   to pray without ceasing, to be devoted to pray.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.360]   And so that's why we pray, right?
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.360]   So again, I want to give you plenty of time
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.360]   to take time to pray.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.360]   But again, I want you guys to continue
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.360]   to wrestle in prayer, right?
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.360]   I know that a lot of you came from work.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.360]   Some of you maybe had a more leisure day.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.360]   Maybe some of you watched a movie before you came.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   But wherever you are, I'm pretty sure most of us,
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.360]   your minds are all over the place.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.360]   And so the greatest hindrance to prayer
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.360]   is what you were doing before you came.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.360]   The things that you're entangled with,
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:38.360]   things that, and they may not be sinful, right?
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:42.360]   And so our natural tendency is as soon as we can't pray
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.360]   or we don't have a hard time, we have a hard time praying,
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:49.360]   we have a tendency to quit if it doesn't come natural, right?
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.360]   Prayer is a muscle that you need to discipline,
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:56.360]   that when you struggle and if you have a hard time,
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.360]   like putting things to word, right?
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.360]   Struggle, wrestle, continue, persevere.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.360]   But if you're in the habit of quitting
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.360]   because two minutes later you don't know what to say,
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.360]   then that's where your prayer life would be, right?
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.360]   And the only time where you're going to have words
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.360]   flowing out of your mouth is when you are desperate,
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.360]   when you're on your deathbed or something desperate happens
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.360]   and you cry out to God.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.360]   But outside of that, you will never learn how to pray.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:26.360]   So learning how to pray requires us to discipline our body
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.360]   and make it our slave.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.360]   So if your mind begins to wander
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.360]   and you feel like you're falling asleep,
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.360]   go drink a cup of water, go walk around outside, pinch yourself, right?
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:38.360]   Do whatever you need to do, but for the next 30 minutes,
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.360]   I'm going to ask you guys, if you need to spread out,
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.360]   if you want to go out and you pray better
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:45.360]   when people are not around, I'll leave that up to you.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.360]   There's space over here, right?
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:50.360]   It always helps me to be in a proper position of prayer,
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.360]   but again, that's me.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.360]   So if you want to pray that way, we have space here.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.360]   Otherwise, you can be in there,
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.360]   and then I'm going to give you about 30 minutes,
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.360]   and then at 8.30, I'm going to--
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.360]   and then our praise team is going to come up,
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:07.360]   and then I'm going to give you about a five-minute presentation about Korea,
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.360]   and then we'll take the rest of the time to pray, okay?
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.360]   So if you can dim the lights,
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.360]   and then, again, if you want to come up,
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.360]   you can take some time to pray.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.360]   Again, pray over the things that you've brought into this room,
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.360]   the unbelievers in your life.
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.360]   Pray over the leaders of our country, right?
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:30.360]   Pray over the salvation of those people who are around you, okay?
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.360]   If you can just have the music on,
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:36.360]   and then, again, we'll give you 30 minutes of uninterrupted prayer.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.360]   Then I'll call you back in 30 minutes.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.360]   Let's pray.

[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.360]   our Summer Mission Korea team.
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.360]   If I can have you guys in the room,
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.360]   just stand up where you are.
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:04.360]   Okay, so let them see where you're at.
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.360]   Okay, are you guys supposed to spread out?
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:07.360]   What happened over there?
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.360]   Okay.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.360]   Yeah, you guys need to spread out right there.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.360]   Just find somewhere else.
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:15.360]   Okay, just walk somewhere else
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:18.360]   where you don't see any of your teammates.
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.360]   Just spread out.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:20.360]   Okay.
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:23.360]   The rest of you.
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.360]   Yeah, just spread out somewhere.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.360]   There's more space back over there.
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.360]   Okay, yeah.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.360]   Over there.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.360]   You can sit on Johnny right there.
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.360]   Okay.
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:35.360]   Yeah, just sit over there.
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:36.360]   Okay, that's good.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.360]   Okay, you guys are spread out.
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.360]   All right, you just kind of--
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.360]   you see where they're at,
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.360]   and we're going to ask you,
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:43.360]   when we get into smaller groups,
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.360]   that you would surround them
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.360]   and take some time to pray for them
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.360]   and give them an opportunity to share with you
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.360]   their own personal prayer requests.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.360]   But before we do that, you guys can sit.
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.360]   At least you guys know where they are.
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.360]   There's 19 of us.
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.360]   We started with 20,
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:59.360]   but then one had to drop out because of work issues,
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.360]   but we have 19, okay?
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.360]   And so we had 20 last year,
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:06.360]   and last year was kind of like the inauguration.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.360]   We went there more like a vision trip
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.360]   to see what's going on,
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:12.360]   and we've already shared with you
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.360]   some of the reasons why we started,
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.360]   but I wanted to review that
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.360]   before we take some time to pray,
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.360]   if you can go down.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.360]   As you can see, that's a picture of Seoul.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.360]   In the last maybe about 30 years,
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:26.360]   one of the fastest-growing economies in the world,
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:29.360]   it went from the poorest country in the world
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:30.360]   right after the war,
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:33.360]   and it was like one of the top five economies,
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.360]   especially in Asia.
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:39.360]   And so especially if you've been to Korea
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.360]   like 15 years ago,
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:41.360]   and then you go now,
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:44.360]   you get a drastic difference.
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:47.360]   But so the two things that happened to Korea
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:49.360]   in the last 50 years is,
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:53.360]   one is the economy just went nuts, right?
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:55.360]   So it went from being that poor
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:58.360]   to that rich in one generation.
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:01.360]   So all the good and the bad that comes with that.
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:04.360]   So it's almost like the country has two separate people.
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:07.360]   You have one generation that grew up in utter poverty,
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.360]   and then you have another generation
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.360]   that grew up with wealth
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:16.360]   that most of the older generation couldn't imagine.
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.360]   So if you know anything about Korea,
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.360]   you know that the younger generation
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.360]   and the older generation,
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:23.360]   the divide is so drastic.
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.360]   And also spiritually,
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.360]   along with the economy growing,
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:32.360]   spiritually, it was the fastest-growing Christian nation
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.360]   in the last 50 years.
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:35.360]   After the Korean War,
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:38.360]   it went from, I think it was about 6% or 7%,
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.360]   and the slides are up there,
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:44.360]   to at the peak, it was about 33%.
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.360]   So it went from,
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:49.360]   it was so poor that they started Compassion International,
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.360]   World Vision.
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.360]   So many of these orphanages started out in Korea
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:54.360]   because after the wars,
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.360]   there were so many kids who were orphaned.
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:57.360]   And it was such a poor country.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.360]   And you heard it from Pastor Peter Chung
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.360]   that even Haiti sent aid.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.360]   And that's how poor Korea was.
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:07.360]   And then it just, the revival broke out.
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:08.360]   And so spiritually,
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:13.360]   it became the second-largest mission-sending organization
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.360]   in the world.
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.360]   It said Compassion,
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:20.360]   it went from receiving nation to supporting nation.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.360]   And in one generation,
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:24.360]   it went from receiving
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:28.360]   to second-highest supporting nation outside of U.S.
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.360]   So U.S. is the number one in mission-sending
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.360]   and number one in financial support.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.360]   And Korea became number one,
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.360]   number two in mission-sending
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.360]   and number two in financial support.
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:39.360]   That's how quickly it grew.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.360]   But the reason why we started going out there,
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:45.360]   if you can start to change the other one.
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.360]   Okay, man, I don't have my glass.
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:49.360]   I can't read this.
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:50.360]   Okay, just to give you
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:52.360]   kind of like some general facts about Korea
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.360]   so that you can pray more effectively,
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:58.360]   30% of Koreans speak English in Korea,
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:00.360]   but they're pretty shy.
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:03.360]   Unless they're very confident,
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:06.360]   they won't speak, right?
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.360]   But I found that that most of them,
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:09.360]   as soon as they feel comfortable,
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:12.360]   their English is a lot better than they let you know.
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.360]   And so when we go out and talk to them,
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.360]   once they break the ice,
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:18.360]   I can say, "Oh, you actually understand."
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:21.360]   But culturally, they'll tell you they're not
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.360]   because they kind of like feel shy about that.
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:27.360]   But according to statistics, about 30%,
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:30.360]   almost 70% of Koreans are college grads,
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:34.360]   which is 50% in U.S., 65% in Japan.
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:37.360]   Taiwan is the highest at 82%,
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.360]   and in India, 25%.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:40.360]   Koreans are known for being
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.360]   the greatest alcohol-consuming country in the world.
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.360]   So if you guys know anything about Korea,
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:47.360]   they're alcohol-obsessed, right, number one.
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:50.360]   And so that contributes to a lot of the pressure
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.360]   that even the Christians are under
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:54.360]   because if they don't drink,
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:57.360]   they feel automatically they're shunned
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:00.360]   by their work culture, their school friends.
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.360]   And so that's one of the big problems out in Korea.
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:05.360]   Korea has the lowest birth rate of any country in the world.
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.360]   I've heard, and I think I may have shared this,
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:11.360]   and I read that if the Korean birth rate continues as it is,
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.360]   they said in 30 years, 30 to 50 years,
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:16.360]   90% of Koreans are going to be gone
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.360]   because it's decreasing.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.360]   That's how quickly it's decreasing.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.360]   So this is an issue not only in Korea, in Japan,
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:26.360]   in China, in Taiwan.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.360]   They're all facing the same problem,
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:30.360]   but Korea is the worst right now.
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:34.360]   And so when I was out in Korea this--
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:36.360]   was it winter or spring?
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.360]   You know, one of the churches that I attended with my mom,
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:44.360]   during the service, they would baptize an infant,
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.360]   and then after they baptized,
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.360]   they would give the parents money.
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:50.360]   And so you know how we have adoption funds?
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.360]   We have birth funds,
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:53.360]   because they're so concerned about the birth rate
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.360]   that churches are starting to collect money
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:57.360]   and give it to young families, whoever.
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:58.360]   And so the government gives them money,
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:01.360]   and churches just to encourage people to have children.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:04.360]   And even with that encouragement,
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.360]   they have the highest, lowest birth rate.
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:09.360]   And so you can sense that when you go to the churches.
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.360]   You just don't see children around, right?
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:14.360]   And so this is a huge problem out in Korea.
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.360]   And this is related spiritually,
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:18.360]   because one, if you ask most of them
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.360]   why you don't have children, it's because of money.
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:23.360]   Because they've made a standard of living,
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:26.360]   at least what they want, so high,
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.360]   and their actual pay is--
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:30.360]   it's not like they can't live,
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:33.360]   but they've created a standard of living that's so high,
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.360]   they think having a kid is impossible
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.360]   because they don't have money.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:40.360]   So it's financial-related, but it's also spiritual,
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:43.360]   because they put such a high value on materialism,
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.360]   and that's what's causing all that.
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.360]   And that's obviously affecting
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.360]   the spiritual atmosphere over there as well.
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:50.360]   And this has also affected the church.
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:52.360]   Materialism has infected the church
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:56.360]   where the non-Christians don't have respect for Christians.
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:00.360]   And so if you can go to the next slide.
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:02.360]   "Christianity was introduced to Korea
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:04.360]   "through businessmen who traveled in China
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.360]   "and ran into Christians as early as 1500."
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:09.360]   It doesn't mean that Korea, the gospel came,
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:13.360]   but there's records of Koreans who ran into businessmen
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.360]   out in China as early as that.
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:18.360]   "Christianity was officially outlawed in Korea
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:21.360]   "until Protestant missionaries came to the peninsula in 1880."
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:25.360]   So the actual Christianity coming into Korea
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.360]   was around 1880.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:31.360]   It was one Presbyterian and one Methodist,
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:32.360]   and they came in.
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:35.360]   Their graves are actually still out in Korea,
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:38.360]   'cause then their children and even their grandchildren
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:41.360]   died sharing the gospel out in Korea.
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:43.360]   And so this was a--
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:46.360]   I mean, literally, Korea was a country that was--
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:50.360]   the gospel was spread by blood of martyrs.
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:53.360]   The early missionaries, many of them were martyred
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.360]   to try to bring the gospel to them.
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.360]   So the spirit of martyrdom
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:00.360]   was what discipled the early Christians.
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:04.360]   And so that's why Christians who became Christian early--
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:08.360]   so if you're a fourth-generation Christian in Korea,
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:11.360]   your great-great-grandparents may have been
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.360]   probably the first Christians out in Korea.
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:17.360]   And so many of them probably either experienced persecution
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.360]   or knew somebody that got martyred for their faith,
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.360]   and that's part of the reason why there was
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:25.360]   such a huge response to Christianity in Korea,
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.360]   because the early Christians there
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:30.360]   literally gave their blood to bring the gospel there,
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.360]   and so did the missionaries.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:34.360]   So that's the history of Christianity,
[01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:37.360]   and it began to explode after the Korean War.
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:39.360]   Next slide.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:42.360]   Seoul holds 9 of the largest--
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:47.360]   10 largest churches in the world, right, is in Seoul.
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:50.360]   So of the 10 megachurches, largest churches in the world,
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:54.360]   9 of them are stationed in one city, right?
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:56.360]   That's how much Christianity has influenced
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:58.360]   in the previous generation.
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:00.360]   South Korea was dubbed "Korean miracle"
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.360]   because of the explosion of Christianity.
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:05.360]   South Korea is the most Christian nation in all of Asia
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:07.360]   by percentage, right?
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.360]   No other Asian country experienced this type of revival
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.360]   outside of Korea, so that's why Korea
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.360]   was the second-largest mission-sending country.
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:16.360]   Even though it's a tiny country,
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:19.360]   it had the second-largest number, right?
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:21.360]   Again, until recently.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.360]   If you can go to the next one.
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:25.360]   So if you look at that, you can see the growth
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:28.360]   of Christianity in 2010, right?
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:30.360]   And this is, what, 14 years ago.
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:35.360]   And right now, it's not--at peak, it was about 33%,
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:39.360]   and right now, it's much lower than 29%.
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.360]   It's not, you know, it's not a huge--
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:44.360]   much less than 29%, because it kept on going up to 33%,
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:46.360]   and then within the last 10 years,
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:49.360]   Christianity has been starting to dip.
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:51.360]   But part of the reason why it dipped
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:54.360]   is because the next generation, the collegiates and younger,
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:56.360]   are completely lost.
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:59.360]   If you can go to the next slide.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:02.360]   Recent polls have shown a sharp decline
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.360]   of professing Christians on college campuses.
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:06.360]   Less than 3% claim to be Christians
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:08.360]   in the younger generation, the Gen Z.
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:12.360]   So at one point at peak, a population was 33%,
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.360]   but if you go to the college campus,
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.360]   it said it's less than 3%.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.360]   It's somewhere closer to 2%,
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.360]   meaning that next generation is completely gone.
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.360]   By the time they're adults,
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:25.360]   all these megachurches are just going to die off,
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:28.360]   because the younger generation is just not coming up, right?
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.360]   And what we found last year
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:33.360]   was that there's still an open door
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:35.360]   to Christianity to these young generations,
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:37.360]   because when we talked to them
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.360]   and when we talked to the churches,
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:42.360]   they were not necessarily closed off to Christianity.
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:45.360]   In fact, a lot of the young people credit Christianity
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:48.360]   for the country becoming what it is--
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:50.360]   financially, morally.
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:52.360]   They credit Korea's success
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:55.360]   to the Christian missionaries who came and helped them.
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:58.360]   So they don't have a bad view of Christianity per se.
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:02.360]   They have a very bad view of Christianity in Korea.
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:05.360]   And so that's why they're more open
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:08.360]   to talking to Christians who are coming from outside,
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:11.360]   especially if you're able to relate to them
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:13.360]   and communicate with them.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:16.360]   They're actually more willing to talk to us
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:19.360]   than they are to the Koreans who speak Korean, right?
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:21.360]   Because we don't have that baggage
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.360]   when we go and share the gospel with them.
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:25.360]   And so that's part of the reason
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:28.360]   why our denomination has asked us to get engaged
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:30.360]   in what's going on in Korea
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.360]   so that we can partner with people
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:35.360]   to try to bring the gospel to them, okay?
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:37.360]   And so if you can go...
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:39.360]   So I don't know if you can read that,
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.360]   but we're going to be following
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.360]   the Colossians 4, 3 to 4 topic
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:45.360]   of praying at the same time for us as well
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.360]   that God would open up the door for the word
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.360]   so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ,
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.360]   for which I have also been imprisoned,
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.360]   that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak.
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:56.360]   So there's four prayer requests.
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.360]   One, pray for doors to be opened
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.360]   to share the gospel in Korea, okay?
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:02.360]   So right now, obviously,
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:05.360]   I believe that there's an open door now
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:07.360]   because so many of these young people
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:09.360]   grew up in the church,
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:11.360]   who are no longer attending church,
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:13.360]   have a base of Christianity in them.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.360]   So it's not like they haven't heard the gospel.
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:17.360]   They know the church culture.
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:19.360]   They just don't want to go to Korean church.
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.360]   I actually have friends
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.360]   who are ministering
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:25.360]   in an English church in Korea,
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.360]   and some of them,
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.360]   half of them are Korean-speaking.
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.360]   So I always ask them,
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.360]   "How come they come to an English-speaking church
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.360]   when there's so many Korean churches?"
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.360]   They say they don't trust the Korean churches.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.360]   So even though they're in Korea
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:41.360]   and their language is not English,
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:45.360]   they said they have an easier time
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:48.360]   trusting the English-speaking pastors.
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:50.360]   Okay, so that kind of gives you an idea
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:52.360]   of what's going on over there.
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:54.360]   So our prayer is we have some people
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:56.360]   that we make connections with,
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:58.360]   but our prayer is that God would open doors
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.360]   to make connections with like-minded,
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.360]   like-hearted people there
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.360]   that we can really get alongside.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.360]   And so we're also going,
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.360]   and we're doing some projects,
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.360]   but our hope is that as we make connection,
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:12.360]   that we would come alongside
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.360]   to help church plant
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.360]   and that our desire is not to simply
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:18.360]   connect more and more churches.
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:20.360]   Our desire is to go there and to really connect
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.360]   and build a healthy, strong church
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:24.360]   where the gospel and the Word of God is taught.
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:26.360]   And so if you can pray,
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.360]   really pray for that because that's our real,
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.360]   like, number one goal in going out this year
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:32.360]   is to find connection
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.360]   where we feel confident
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.360]   that like-minded, like-hearted people
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:38.360]   that we can work with.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:40.360]   And two, pray for the connections we've made
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:42.360]   with like-minded people, and that's number two.
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:44.360]   Pray that God would give us the heart
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.360]   and boldness to make clear the mystery of the cross
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:48.360]   to people we will meet there.
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:50.360]   And obviously, we have a lot of young people that are going.
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:52.360]   And, you know, our training
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.360]   basically is if you're not witnessing
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.360]   here, you can't turn it on over there.
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.360]   Right? And so
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.360]   if you can pray for us that even now,
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.360]   that God will begin to give the members,
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.360]   you guys as well, but the members
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:06.360]   who are going, the heart of evangelism
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:08.360]   so when we get there,
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.360]   that would be, that's not something
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:12.360]   that we have to force. It would naturally
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.360]   be able to share the gospel with the people
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:16.360]   that we meet. Pray that the team will
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.360]   return with a greater vision for global evangelism
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.360]   and sense of urgency
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.360]   to spread the gospel. So, not only
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:24.360]   for when we're there,
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:26.360]   every short-term missions that we're doing
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:28.360]   and I've already shared that
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:30.360]   there's going to be a Taiwan mission
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:32.360]   that's happening in October,
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:34.360]   but every time we go out to mission, our goal
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:36.360]   is not simply to make an impact
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:38.360]   there, but we're hoping that it would affect
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.360]   the whole church. The few people that
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:42.360]   are going will be able to come back and share the sense
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:44.360]   of urgency, and so even if you
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.360]   didn't physically go, that the church
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.360]   would be renewed and revived for the
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:50.360]   vision toward evangelism and
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:52.360]   great commission, even back at home. So if you can
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:54.360]   take some time to pray for that.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:56.360]   If I can ask you guys, our team
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.360]   members to stand up, okay?
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.360]   Stand up again, and if you
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:02.360]   are near them, okay?
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:04.360]   Try to surround them and
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.360]   somebody just take charge
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:08.360]   and lead that
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:10.360]   group in prayer, and then if the
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:12.360]   rest of you, if you can just kind of circle around
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:14.360]   maybe with about four people around
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:16.360]   you, and just go down the topic.
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.360]   Okay? And take some
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.360]   time to pray over these topics. Just give
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.360]   each person a different topic to pray
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.360]   for. If you're not with a
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:26.360]   team member, if you're with a team member,
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.360]   ask them what their prayer request is
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:30.360]   and have them share, and then
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.360]   just take some time to pray over
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:34.360]   them, okay?
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:36.360]   Now.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:38.360]   Alright?
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:42.360]   We'll give you a total of about 15 minutes,
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.360]   so about 9.05 we'll come back together.
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:48.360]   [music]
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:28:00.360]   Somebody near there, especially
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.360]   you guys,
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:04.360]   be a man and take charge.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:06.360]   Okay?
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:08.360]   Somebody speak up
[01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:10.360]   and say,
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.360]   "What's your prayer request?"
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.360]   [music]
