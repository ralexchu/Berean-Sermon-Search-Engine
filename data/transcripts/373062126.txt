[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Lord, we thank you for your grace.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.360]   God, we are so grateful, Lord, that your mercy continues to abound.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:26.840]   God, because of your infinite character, Lord, we can continue to draw our life from you.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:34.120]   And God, as we even evaluate even just this week, perhaps we have had many failures, perhaps
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.080]   we've even sinned, and perhaps, Father God, we feel discouraged by various things going
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.080]   on in our lives.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.560]   But in the midst of that, God, we can look to you no matter the circumstance.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.040]   And we want to thank you.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:55.000]   And we pray that as we hear the exhortation from Scripture to rejoice in the Lord, I pray,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.280]   God, all the more that we would truly learn what that means and what's more to experience
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.280]   that in our day.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.280]   God, we thank you in Christ's name.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.280]   Amen.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.280]   Okay.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.280]   All right.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.240]   So I will read this passage for us first.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.560]   Looking at chapter 4, 1 through 9, and it says, "Therefore, my beloved brethren, whom
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.920]   I long to see my joy and crown, in this way stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.920]   I urge Eurydice and I urge Syntyche to live in harmony in the Lord.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.440]   Indeed, true companion, I ask you also to help these women who have shared my struggle
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.320]   in the cause of the gospel, together with Clement also and the rest of my fellow workers,
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.040]   whose names are in the book of life.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.600]   Rejoice in the Lord always.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.680]   Again I say, rejoice.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.400]   Let your gentle spirit be known to all men.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.880]   The Lord is near.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.560]   Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving,
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.160]   let your requests be made known to God.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.160]   And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.880]   your minds in Christ Jesus.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.440]   Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.560]   is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence, if
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.520]   anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.920]   The things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.760]   and the God of peace will be with you.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.760]   Okay?
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.500]   Now, as usual what I like to do is kind of break down the passage for you in four segments.
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.120]   And this is the way that I broke it down.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.680]   As I look at this passage, there is a strong, emphatic command in verse one, saying, "Therefore,"
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.680]   right?
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.320]   "In this way stand firm in the Lord."
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.320]   Okay?
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.200]   "Stand firm in the Lord" is the major command that's introducing this next section.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.600]   It's the transition from the last.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.520]   And then in verse two and three, Paul calls for the harmony between these two ladies.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.600]   And then in verse four through seven, it's really interesting because there's this rapid
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.880]   fire commandments that come at you.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.360]   Rejoice, there's the let your gentle spirit be known, be anxious for nothing, and then
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.560]   let your request be made known, right?
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.160]   But the way that I've kind of summarized those together, I'd summarize that as commands of
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.160]   peace.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.320]   Because, yes, although the emphatic command is "Stand firm," I saw that there was quite
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.480]   a theme related to peace, right?
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.960]   That's given there.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.300]   And then, verse eight through nine, he gives two commands, which is dwell on these things
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.120]   and practice these things, right?
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.080]   So again, outlines aren't set in stone.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.000]   This isn't "Thus says the Lord, thou shalt outline my verse this way."
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.080]   This is just me looking at the flow of thought, and I hope you guys are getting the pattern
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.360]   of doing that.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.240]   It makes, it forces you to read and reread the passage over and over, and then just to
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.280]   think like, "What is this train of thought here?"
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.280]   Okay?
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.080]   So, as an introductory remark, there's like way too much stuff to cover in today's lesson.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:21.560]   I set the major outline of the book in terms of my teaching outline for this session, and
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.400]   I realized, man, when we're going over nine verses together, it's pretty tough, okay?
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.440]   Now what I'd like to say is this, is a remark of, kind of some preliminary remarks.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:41.080]   Remember that in the last session, we took a look at verse 20 and 21, chapter three,
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.960]   and Apostle Paul talked about, "For our citizenship," as in contrast to those who are enemies of
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.960]   the cross.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.640]   And he emphatically talked about our perspective that we belong in heaven, essentially.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.880]   And from heaven, we eagerly await the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.720]   the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of his glory.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.640]   God, in his work in this current generation, he is sanctifying us, and then we know by
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.520]   what the scripture teaches, we're going to be perfected, glorified, right?
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.700]   And then he says he's going to do that by the exertion of the power that he has even
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.820]   to subject all things to himself.
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.080]   So clearly, Apostle Paul's mind is currently future-oriented, right?
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.360]   It's heavenly.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.000]   He's got the eternal perspective going on, and when he's calling the church, you need
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.040]   to stand firm in this fashion, right?
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.480]   The exhortation to think that way about your identity in heaven, and then these next commands
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:45.000]   that'll come, it all builds to this exhortation that we need to stand firm in these things,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   right?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.040]   So, it fits well in terms of the transition of thought.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.040]   And what's really interesting is if the major command in verse one is "Stand firm," the
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.560]   following commands, I'm not sure if you saw like a similarity in all the commands.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.440]   You know, I'm sure you guys noticed, yeah, they have a lot to do with harmony and peace
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.040]   and things like that.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.040]   But if you think of it one way, I'm not saying, again, this is 100% correct, but if you think
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.880]   of it one way, he's saying, "Stand firm," and then he gives you these various attitudes,
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.720]   these various conditions of heart, these various things that actually support you standing
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.000]   firm because if any one of those things were jettisoned, if any one of those things were
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.520]   struggling, you would not be able to stand.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.560]   You would be really, really weak and feeble and wavering all sorts of different fashions.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.440]   So again, I saw it as here's this command in transition of thought, here's the perspective
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.080]   Apostle Paul gave, starting even from chapter one, there's perspective, perspective, perspective,
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.080]   right?
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.320]   Christ needs to be exalted, Christ is the most value.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.680]   If I'm, you know, we need to have the attitude of Jesus, perspective, perspective, and he
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.800]   says, "Stand firm," and then this is how you stand firm, okay?
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.560]   Now what I'd like to do is then, oh, here's the diagram of the way.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.560]   You know what?
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.560]   Sorry, give me a moment here.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.160]   It's because I have this in a different view.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:17.400]   I'm going to put it into a view where I can see what's coming up next so I know to show
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.040]   you the slide.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.720]   Okay.
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:28.640]   So in the next, in this next section then, in section one, let's talk about this command.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.080]   Now again, there's a lot of things to cover, Apostle Paul's perspective on the church,
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.720]   his love for them, all that kind of stuff.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.640]   I leave that to your just meditation.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.400]   But I want us to think about this idea of standing firm.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:48.640]   And one of the things that I challenged you was as we do Bible study, there are times
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.000]   when you dig deep and you ask the questions, "How do I interpret this?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.880]   What does this mean?"
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.920]   There are times when you're digging deep to think about what we're doing right now.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:04.320]   It's like he has certain perspectives and teachings and you're looking for deep insight.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:10.000]   But then if you recall the previous time I said sometimes when the Bible, the passage
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.540]   is coming at you not with theology but it's coming at you with direct commands, you should
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.620]   be thinking application.
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:23.260]   And then at other times, I believe it is so important for us to stop and meditate.
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.440]   Because when he says stand firm, is that oh so confusing?
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.440]   Is that so nebulous?
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.480]   What we should be thinking is just starting to ruminate around, "Hmm, why?
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.700]   Why is he challenging us to stand firm in this?"
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.060]   And then yes, definitely you should start meditating how.
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:48.480]   But in a more personal way, if the scripture is telling you stand firm, one easy way to
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:54.900]   meditate for yourself is why do I need to stand firm, right?
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:00.080]   Because are you currently experiencing the same exact circumstance that the Philippians
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.200]   are?
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.980]   Are you being persecuted?
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:09.760]   Now clearly, one of the things that we can relate to is not necessarily just the persecution
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:16.000]   but we talked about how the onslaught of false teaching, the onslaught of difficult circumstances,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.860]   the many varieties of trials that come, you could relate to that, right?
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.020]   Why is it that we need to stand firm?
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.160]   Because there is never a season in your life where there's something to or there's nothing
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.680]   to complain about, right?
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.020]   There's always something coming at you.
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.000]   We definitely need to stand firm.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.620]   Are there dangers of grumbling?
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.280]   Are there dangers of false teachers?
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.600]   Are there dangers of enticements and lurements of the world?
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.740]   Absolutely.
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.020]   But another way to meditate about this is one of the things I start doing is I start
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:49.480]   thinking how am I not standing firm, right?
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.180]   Not just simply, "Well, how do I stand firm?"
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.180]   But how am I not?
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:56.660]   As an evaluation and meditation of myself, how am I not standing firm?
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.300]   How are these people not standing firm?
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:03.280]   Are there any indications in the passage that I've already read that tells me that these
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:08.260]   individuals too, even though they were a model church, even though in many ways they're so
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.560]   noble and commendable, how are they not?
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.000]   And we notice that Apostle Paul highly emphasizes the topics of unity.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.520]   Could it be that even yes, godly individuals serving, doing ministry, that there could
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.520]   be discord, disagreement, and rifts?
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.320]   Yeah, right?
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.680]   Could that be seen as not standing firm?
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.680]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:36.200]   And so again, that was just an encouragement and challenge to you to think about standing
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:42.880]   firm and meditating on just the whys and the hows, and not only in this passage, but even
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.720]   in reflecting upon your life as well, okay?
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:51.700]   Now I do want to share with you that that theme of standing firm, the exhortation for
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:56.400]   us to stand firm, you know it's just riddled throughout so many of the teachings through
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.520]   the New Testament, and I wanted to share a couple with you, and here's one from 2 Thessalonians
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.680]   chapter 2 verse 15 through 17.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.640]   "So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught."
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:15.480]   So in one method of standing firm is just make sure, am I staying true and consistent
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.480]   to the patterns that have been taught, right?
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.680]   "Whether by word or by mouth or by letter from us, now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself,
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.240]   God of our Father who has loved us, given us eternal comfort and good hope by grace,
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.040]   comfort and strength in your hearts in every good work and word."
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.440]   Here's another passage, 1 Corinthians 15 verse 58.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:39.360]   "Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm, let nothing move you, always give yourselves
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.040]   fully to the work of the Lord."
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.600]   Is it not the case?
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:50.520]   When we feel like we've done enough, and then we seek to just veg, we seek to turn off our
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:55.600]   brains, we seek to come home and just relax.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.960]   A lot of times, actually, it's better to stay in motion, right?
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.960]   Kind of like what he's saying here.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.600]   Here's another passage, Ephesians chapter 6 verse 11.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:07.080]   It says, "Put on the full armor of God so that you will be able to stand firm against
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.240]   the schemes of the devil."
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.880]   Verse 13, "Therefore, take up the full armor of God so that you will be able to resist
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.680]   in the evil day, having done everything to stand firm.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.200]   Stand firm, therefore, having girded your loins with truth, having put on the breastplate
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:27.720]   of righteousness, having shod your feet with preparation of the gospel of peace."
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.560]   Now again, because there's so much to cover in today's lesson, I'm going to pause there,
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.600]   but I just want to challenge you.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:39.280]   There are some of you who, you know, in recent, let's say like the last six months or so,
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.960]   I feel like our church has talked a lot about drifting.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.840]   I just recently asked the people who are planning for BAM retreat in the winter, "Hey, what
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.960]   was the last retreat, previous two?"
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.640]   And they were like, "Oh, it was about drifting."
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.080]   We talked about drifting on Sunday.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:57.360]   We talked about drifting on the couples retreat and all this kind of stuff.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.840]   And then there are some people who are just so frustrated.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:08.600]   I feel like drifting is just natural pattern of life because we're so inundated with distractions,
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.600]   right?
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:16.000]   Now, I just want to encourage you, remember that feeling of like, "Oh, I'm standing firm."
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.520]   You know there's no one trick to that.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.040]   You know there's no one tip advice, but you know what I do on Wednesday nights?
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.480]   I do Bible study and I'm firm, right?
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.720]   There is no one shortcut to standing firm.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.440]   Clearly, the past tells you there is such a danger that the devil is scheming in multiple
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.280]   fashions to trip you up.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.560]   And the reason why you feel like, "Oh my goodness, is every season drifting season?"
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.480]   You know, it's like, it's partially because there's always constantly attack on you.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.320]   I think we have to be sober and realize that, amen?
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.620]   But the other part is, remember, the fruit of being able to stand firm comes from such
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:56.560]   investment of desiring to put on not just pieces, not just the one important part, but
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.240]   the full armor of the Lord.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.520]   Desiring to have everything God has afforded you, the community, the word, the prayer,
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:08.260]   the work he's given you, all of that God desires for you to take advantage of.
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.480]   And so I want to give you that admonition encouragement.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:16.360]   Like, so much of scripture desires for you to stand firm, not just for a season, but
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.840]   until the Lord.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.840]   Okay?
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.120]   Point two.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:26.200]   In the next section, we have the desire for harmony, the command for harmony.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.720]   And I want to read this verse, two verses.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.720]   It says, "I urge Yodia and I urge Sintike to live in harmony in the Lord.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.260]   Indeed, true companion, I ask you also to help these women who have shared my struggle
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:43.040]   in the cause of the gospel, together with Clement also and the rest of my fellow workers
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.640]   whose names are in the book of life."
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.140]   So when we look at this, the first thing I want to talk about is just like, wow, how
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.720]   important is this topic?
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.760]   The topic of harmony.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:03.680]   I mean, you realize that clearly just from observation, you have, I urge twice.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.800]   I urge Yodia, I urge Sintike.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:13.600]   What else is you have this admonition where in other passages, even talking about some
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.280]   of those false teachers, it may have been that those false teachers existed in the church,
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.680]   but he didn't name them.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.400]   But you notice here, wow, he calls them out.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:29.040]   I mean, can you imagine having your name be called out in a public square like this?
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.440]   Can you imagine if I pointed, actually like directed my attention and I said, "Dude,
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.040]   Lindsay, can you, I urge you.
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.280]   Can you live with harmony with Sam?
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.280]   Where's Sam?
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.960]   Where are you?
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.480]   I saw you just a moment ago.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.640]   There you are.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.880]   Can you sisters just get along?"
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:51.000]   And then I tell the whole table, "Hey, girls, can you please help her?"
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.200]   I mean, but that's kind of like the sentiment here, right?
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:59.480]   Like if you take a moment to think like, oh shoot, he named them.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.920]   And now for the rest of history, it's like written in the word.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.780]   That's kind of intense, right?
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:12.480]   So now you have to start thinking like, why did Apostle Paul see it necessary to do that,
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.880]   right?
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.480]   And just don't worry, I asked him for the permission to use their names before.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.640]   Because some of you guys, if I called attention to you in a room this big, I mean, the weight
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.160]   of the pressure would be pretty heavy, right?
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.840]   So if you think about it, we know already it's like, the topic of unity is huge.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.840]   He's talked about it at length.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.420]   If you remember in chapter two, when Paul talked about it, he gave both the like explicit
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.520]   command and the example of Christ, and he commanded every single one of them, "You need
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.100]   to be one," right?
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:51.140]   And we know from other passages of the scripture that the topic of unity is so important because
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:58.520]   the ministry, the whole like agenda of what we're doing has to exist in the context of
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.060]   unity.
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.460]   We are proclaiming the name of Christ.
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:09.420]   We are upholding the gospel with the very character of the church together, right?
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:14.060]   Scripture says that Christ is going to reveal the manifold wisdom of God by joining together
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:20.540]   impossible people, by building this church of individuals so far, so wide, and then drawing
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.580]   everybody to a certain degree, not that you're just simply in one room, but that you would
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:27.060]   be made one.
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:32.620]   And that incredible mystery is going to glorify the power that makes us one, which is Christ
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.900]   himself, right?
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:41.180]   Every single one of us being found in Christ is going to be the power that is revealed.
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:45.980]   And so scripture says it's so important for us to be united.
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:46.980]   Thank you.
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:47.980]   Okay.
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:54.060]   So that being said, I want to kind of mention here a little bit, what can we observe about
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.060]   Yoria and Sintike?
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.900]   I know that's maybe one of the questions that you guys were kind of thinking about.
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:03.300]   And what's really interesting is they were true companions.
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.640]   It says that they shared in the struggle.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.620]   Clearly they're like numbered with the fellow workers, and clearly they're numbered with
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.820]   those who are in the book of life, meaning they are genuine Christians.
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:18.680]   Paul was convinced that there are individuals who bore those kind of qualities.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:24.720]   And so that, I just want to quickly make mention of this idea that then, you know, what's very
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:30.660]   interesting is, A, you could have individuals who are good and godly.
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.740]   You could have individuals who are active, working hard, and participating.
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.160]   They are present in the ministry of the church.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.860]   And perhaps then they were actually quite well known.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:45.420]   I mean, to be labeled or I guess named within this letter, then perhaps they were quite
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.900]   well known.
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:55.600]   Now the reason why I say this is because then number one, even when we're doing fine, I
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:01.040]   want you to understand that because our enemy schemes, one of the things that he will do
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.080]   is he's going to conquer to divide.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.000]   Sorry, I said that totally backwards.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.960]   He's going to divide to conquer.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.040]   Okay, but you guys know what I mean.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.100]   All right.
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:20.220]   So that being the case, have, you know, have you seen, have we seen, is it totally possible
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:24.440]   that sometimes there is even amongst individuals who have been working and laboring that these
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.600]   rifts and strifes may happen?
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.840]   It is not permissible for us to be like, "Ah, you know what?
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.840]   You do your own thing.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.180]   I do mine."
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.720]   Within the church, it is not permissible to say, "Ah, you know what?
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.840]   Then I'm not going to talk to you."
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.840]   Right?
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:38.840]   No.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.960]   So this kind of disunity is incredibly dangerous and the conflicts must be resolved to the
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:50.440]   degree that in your packet, I highlighted this, we can't ignore the fact that Paul called
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:54.440]   upon the members of the church to go help.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.600]   Right?
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:02.720]   So remember, number one, even good and godly Christians can be susceptible to divisions,
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:09.360]   but what's more, even personal relational conflict does not just reside in its privacy,
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.840]   it affects the church.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:16.560]   And it's a responsibility, therefore, of the church to come alongside and help.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.320]   And so I'm going to leave that to your discussion.
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.480]   In what way are you supposed to help be a peacemaker?
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.720]   Now there are some people who operate by the, "If it's not your business, don't stick your
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.720]   nose in it."
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.720]   Right?
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.880]   There are a lot of people who don't want to get involved in that because if you do, you're
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.000]   going to get dirty.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.080]   But the fact of the matter is scripture calls us to a higher, I guess, calling for us to
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:42.360]   provide that level of context of harmony within the body.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:47.640]   A cross-reference to that is Ephesians chapter 4, verse 2 through 6, "With all humility and
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:52.960]   gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love, being diligent to
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.880]   preserve the unity of the spirit and the bond of peace, there is one body, one spirit, just
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:02.720]   as also you were called in one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:08.080]   one God, and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all."
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.280]   So you see the concept that we were talking about earlier, joined together.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:18.360]   Your unity is reflective of the nature of the gospel and of our God.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:25.560]   So therefore, no, to be okay with just dysfunctional, like divide and this, you know, this discord
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:30.240]   and conflict, that is not permissible within the church.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.240]   All right.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:36.600]   We're going to move to the next section, which is verse 4 through 7.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.000]   Okay.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Sorry about the...
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.720]   All right.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.040]   So here in verse 4 through 7, it says, "Rejoice in the Lord always.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.680]   Again I say, rejoice.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.080]   Let your gentle spirit be known to all men.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.400]   The Lord is near.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.120]   Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving,
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.320]   let your requests be made known to God."
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.440]   Okay.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:04.640]   What I did here is just like, you know, I mentioned in previous lessons, whenever I
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.800]   see this list, I start numbering them.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.160]   I start asking, do I see any kind of similarity?
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.840]   Is there a flow of thought?
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.240]   And sometimes it's hard to answer, right?
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:19.440]   And sometimes you're just trying to see like, hmm, is there some kind of sequence?
[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.940]   Does one build on the other?
[00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.740]   Is this building blocks?
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.120]   Is this cause and effect?
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.240]   You should try to think about the relationships between these things.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:33.840]   The way that I'm going to talk about it is, remember, I saw it as, man, if you can't do
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.240]   these things, you can't stand firm.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.360]   Okay.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.120]   That's the way I saw it.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.640]   But they definitely feed to each other, right?
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:48.520]   That the rejoicing is going to be your source of power for your gentleness.
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.760]   And that those things combined is going to produce in you such a steadfast firmness that
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:58.960]   you won't be anxious because you have a resource to turn to, which is your God, your heavenly
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.800]   Father, and making your request be known.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   Okay.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.760]   Now again, I try to connect those things.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.000]   A lot of times you'll sit there and wrestle with, hmm, how do these things link together?
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.840]   Now again, for the sake of time, I'm not going to be able to go over everything, but I'm
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:19.980]   going to lump it all together and talk about one really important thing, which is this.
[00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:25.980]   Every one of those things, rejoice, being gentle, not being anxious, and making requests,
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:31.320]   to me have an emphatic arrow pointing to God.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.280]   Right?
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.840]   It is, you are to rejoice in the Lord.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:43.240]   The gentle spirit, you letting that know, is the outflow of your rejoicing.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.640]   It's the outflow of you knowing that the Lord is near.
