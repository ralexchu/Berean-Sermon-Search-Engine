[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   Good morning, Church family.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.900]   My name is Abby Young, and this is my testimony.
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.320]   I grew up in a very loving home with Christian parents and the best older brother anyone
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.320]   could ask for.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.960]   My parents were very intentional with my brother and me, even praying for us while we were
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.240]   each in the womb that we would come to know Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.320]   I was born with an extremely competitive nature, and as a star-struck little sister, I had
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.680]   always aspired to be just like my brother.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.840]   However, it wasn't an "imitate me as I imitate Christ" sort of goal, but rather a "how can
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.800]   I be as good as Gaga, if not better than him" mentality.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.720]   Everything Gaga did, I wanted to do.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.760]   One night when I was four and my brother was seven, my brother accepted Christ, so I thought,
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.760]   "Well, if Gaga is doing it, of course I want to do it."
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.200]   I accepted God into my heart, but in all honesty, I had no idea what that meant.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.360]   A few years later, when I was nine years old, my understanding of goodness changed.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.680]   I had a good group of nice friends.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.200]   One day we took a photo together, and a girl who had developmental delay named Sharon wanted
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.640]   to be in our picture.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.840]   I knew nothing about health care at that time, so from my understanding, Sharon was born
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.840]   with her heart upside down.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.840]   We begrudgingly said yes, because isn't that what nice girls do?
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.160]   I went home with my best friend at the time, and we agreed that we would just crop her
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.960]   out of the photo.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.680]   Two weeks later, Sharon passed away.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.200]   This was when God revealed to me the truth.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.320]   I cried, recognizing that I was a sinner and I had nothing that could earn any semblance
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.680]   of goodness.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.000]   I had thought that I knew how to love others, but I couldn't even take one photo with someone
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.720]   different from me.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.800]   I realized that it wasn't just Sharon that was born with her heart upside down.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.800]   It was me.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.640]   That night, my mom walked me through the sinner's prayer yet again, but this time it was different.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.520]   This time, I wasn't praying to God asking him to make me a better person.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.040]   I was asking him to save me from myself.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.160]   I truly believe that this was the point that I was saved.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.200]   A couple years later, after that moment, I chose to be sprinkled at my home church as
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.520]   an outward expression of inward faith.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.840]   However, the journey from justification through sanctification was and continues to be one
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.720]   requiring lots and lots of patience.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.560]   While I finally had a grasp of my depravity, instead of being liberating, at many times
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   it was debilitating.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.320]   I found myself burdened under the weight of my imperfection, knowing in my mind that I
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.720]   was saved through faith alone, but having difficulty understanding why a perfect God
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.840]   would love someone as imperfect as me.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.360]   There were days when I would frustratingly sit in the school bathroom wanting to inflict
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.560]   self-harm on myself because I didn't deserve the body that God had given me.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.080]   I wrestled constantly with my competitive nature, not being perfect enough, whether
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.800]   it was in academics, sports, or more importantly, godliness.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.160]   When I moved to Irvine to attend UCI for nursing school, God sovereignly placed me at Berean
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.320]   and surrounded me with individuals whose passion for the Word was palpable.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.600]   This was when I began to take the study of God's Word seriously.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.080]   I understood more deeply that the gospel was not simply a tool to bolster up my sense of
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.840]   self-worth, something I craved throughout my entire life.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.240]   Instead the truth was even my foolish attempts at perfection were filthy rags.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.000]   They were ways in which I was rejecting God, claiming that I did not need him to make me
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   holy.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.520]   I recognized that those motives, though they may appear shiny and clean on the outside,
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.960]   were heinous and reeking of death, much like whitewashed tombs.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.400]   My niceness was a manipulative tool to convince myself and others that I deserved some sort
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.680]   of reward, rendering the work of Christ on the cross as worthless instead of myself.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.600]   The worst part of it all was that my sins separated me from my heavenly Father and the
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.160]   giver of life.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.880]   I was not just some kid that God didn't want to take a photo with because I was different.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.440]   I was an enemy trying to usurp his authority and deserving of wrath and eternal condemnation.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.640]   I made life about myself, but all the while he was the one deserving of praise, not me.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.840]   What I'm still continually growing in my understanding of day by day is that despite all that, God
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.200]   chose to send his only son to die on a cross, take upon himself the burden of my guilt and
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.240]   shame, and rise again so that I may have life abundant in him.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.080]   I no longer live for temporary accolades, fearful of man's rejection of my shortcomings.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.000]   Rather, I now live to be like the Samaritan woman at the well, unabashed, yelling, "Come
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.280]   see the man who told me all the things I have done."
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.040]   I now live for his glory alone, wanting the world not to see me but him.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.040]   Philippians 3, 7-9 says this, "But whatever gain I had, I counted as lost for the sake
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.040]   of Christ.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.080]   Indeed, I count everything as lost because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.080]   Jesus my Lord.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.200]   For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.440]   that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.440]   comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.440]   that depends on faith."
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.720]   Today, I am choosing to be baptized by immersion as a response to what the Lord has revealed
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.640]   to me in scripture and to fulfill all obedience to his command.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.440]   As a representation of the work he has accomplished in me, I want to proclaim my union with Christ
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.960]   in his death and resurrection and be a tool for his glory.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.960]   Praise be to God.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.960]   Thank you.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.960]   [applause]
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:57.280]   >> I would understand when you go into the water, you're uniting with Christ in his
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.080]   death and when you come out, you're uniting with his resurrected life.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.080]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.080]   Amen.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.080]   [applause]
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.080]   [applause]
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.520]   [applause]
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.680]   (audience applauding)
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.180]   (applause)
