[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.680]   with humility knowing we are in need of your mercies.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.680]   May we come now with eagerness to praise you, to honor you, and to know you,
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.180]   for it would be our greatest desire.
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.680]   Teach us, Lord, how to pray, how to be obedient to you,
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.680]   and to live a life worthy of the gospel we receive.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:14.180]   May we take great joy in knowing we as your children can draw near to you with confidence
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.680]   that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need,
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.180]   and all of this because of Christ Jesus.
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.680]   So may you be blessed tonight, Lord, in Christ's name we pray. Amen.

[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:10.680]   Great is thy faithfulness, O Lord.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:16.680]   Great is thy faithfulness.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:26.680]   (gentle music)
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.680]   And as we gather.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:35.680]   As we gather, may your spirit work within us.
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:43.680]   As we gather, may we glorify your name.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:50.680]   Knowing well that as our hearts begin to worship,
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:57.680]   we'll be blessed because we care.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.680]   We'll be blessed because we care.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.680]   Knowing well.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:12.680]   Knowing well that as our hearts begin to worship,
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:19.680]   we'll be blessed because we care.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:26.680]   We'll be blessed because we care.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:44.680]   (gentle music)
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.680]   Bless the Lord.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.680]   Bless the Lord, O my soul.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.680]   O my soul.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:59.680]   Worship his holy name.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.680]   Sing like never before.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.680]   O my soul.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:13.680]   I'll worship your holy name.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.680]   The sun comes up.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.680]   The sun comes up.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.680]   It's a new day dawning.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.680]   It's time to sing your song again.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:40.680]   Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:49.680]   Let me be singing when the evening comes.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.680]   Bless the Lord.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.680]   Bless the Lord, O my soul.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   O my soul.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:06.680]   Worship his holy name.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.680]   Sing like never before.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.680]   O my soul.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:20.680]   I'll worship your holy name.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.680]   (gentle music)
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.680]   You're rich in love.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:33.680]   You're rich in love and you're slow to anger.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:39.680]   Your name is great and your heart is kind.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:47.680]   For all your goodness I will keep on singing.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:56.680]   10,000 reasons for my heart to clap.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.680]   Bless the Lord.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:04.680]   Bless the Lord, O my soul.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.680]   O my soul.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:13.680]   Worship his holy name.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.680]   Sing like never before.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.680]   O my soul.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:27.680]   I'll worship your holy name.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.680]   (gentle music)
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.680]   And on that day, and on that day,
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.680]   when my strength is failing,
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:46.680]   the end draws near and my time has come.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:54.680]   Still my soul will sing your praise unending.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:19:03.680]   10,000 years and then forever more.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.680]   So bless the Lord.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:11.680]   Bless the Lord, O my soul.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.680]   O my soul.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:20.680]   Worship his holy name.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:25.680]   Sing like never before.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.680]   O my soul.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:33.680]   I'll worship your holy name.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.680]   Bless the Lord.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.680]   Bless the Lord, O my soul.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.680]   O my soul.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:48.680]   Worship his holy name.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:53.680]   Sing like never before.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.680]   O my soul.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:02.680]   I'll worship your holy name.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:09.680]   Lord, I'll worship your holy name.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:16.680]   Lord, I'll worship your holy name.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.680]   (gentle music)
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.680]   - And then you may be seated.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:33.680]   - All right, thank you for all of you
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.680]   who've come to take time to pray with us.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.680]   We're gonna do things a little bit different tonight,
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:45.680]   but before we get started, today is June 25th, right?
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.680]   And you guys all probably know that,
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:53.680]   but June 25th is a special day in Korea
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:59.680]   because this is the day that the North Koreans came in
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.680]   and started the war with the South.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.680]   And so when I was younger,
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.680]   there actually used to, there's a song that we would all sing
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.680]   and that basically is that 6/25/1950
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.680]   is a day that we should never forget.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.680]   And so every kid who grew up in Korea during that era
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.680]   knows that song by heart.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.680]   And the reason why they made us sing that
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.680]   is because it was a constant reminder for us
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:29.680]   that we were at war with North Korea
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.680]   and that we should always be ready.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.680]   And so again, back in the '70s,
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.680]   when they would ring the sirens at 10 o'clock,
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.680]   you'd have to go home.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.680]   And anybody else who stayed outside after 10 o'clock,
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.680]   it's like, oh, you're a North Korean spy,
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.680]   or if you disobey the government,
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.680]   you're a North Korean spy.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.680]   So there was this constant warning
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.680]   that we can go back to war with North Korea at any time.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.680]   And so again, in Korean, we would sing this song,
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.680]   especially on this day, we would sing this song,
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.680]   say 6/25, this is the day that our enemies
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.680]   came marching into South, and we would sing this in Korean.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.680]   I share this with you because the scripture tells us
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.680]   that we are to be reminded that we are in
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.680]   this constant spiritual warfare.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.680]   And when we forget that and we begin to live like civilians,
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.680]   as if this is our home, then our first thing that you'll see
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.680]   is our prayer life suffers.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.680]   Because whether you pray or don't pray,
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.680]   because it is a spiritual endeavor,
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.680]   you don't necessarily see a radical difference in your life.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.680]   If you don't study the Bible, you know,
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.680]   you get shamed when you go to Don Quixote.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.680]   If you know more about the scripture,
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.680]   you can share with other people, and there's a way to measure
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.680]   if you know the Bible or don't know the Bible.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:47.680]   But prayer is directly connected to our soberness
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:50.680]   and understanding that there's a spiritual battle going on.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.680]   And so as I've been mentioning,
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.680]   I'm sure if you've been on the Internet
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.680]   and you've been hearing other pastors,
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.680]   there's been constant reminder that the devil
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.680]   has been very active recently,
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.680]   not just through what's been going on in the government,
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:08.680]   but the pulpit, and as I mentioned last Sunday,
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.680]   has been corrupted.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.680]   There's always been corruption in it,
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.680]   but now it's almost like if you don't test
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.680]   what's coming off the pulpit, you will be deceived.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.680]   That's how much wrong doctrines are coming off of pulpits.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.680]   And many, some of them may not even be Christians.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:28.680]   And it's no longer shocking what I hear from the pulpit.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.680]   And so in order to engage in this battle,
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:35.680]   we need to build a church that's going to last more than you.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.680]   We want to make sure that we build a church
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.680]   where it's going to be inherited by the next generation,
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.680]   your children and children after that.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.680]   In order to do that, we need to have a healthy church,
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:51.680]   more than being concerned about multiplying fast
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.680]   and getting as many churches planted as much as possible.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.680]   I think the greatest problem today
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.680]   is not that we don't have enough churches.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.680]   The problem today is the churches aren't healthy.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.680]   And so we've always, from the very get-go of the church,
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.680]   wanted to build a healthy church.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.680]   And then when the church is healthy,
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.680]   we pray that it would multiply.
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.680]   And so in building the healthy church,
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.680]   we put four visions together.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.680]   The first and the most important is,
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.680]   when you come through Bryn,
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.680]   that we want to have a God-centered church,
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.680]   not man-centered.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.680]   God-centered meaning that we are primarily concerned
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.680]   about what God thinks.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:36.680]   Before we think about what would they think if they hear this,
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.680]   what kind of church does our neighbors want?
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.680]   What kind of church is needed in our generation?
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.680]   Our primary concern is what does God think?
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.680]   God-centered.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.680]   In fact, one of the most freeing things for Christians
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.680]   is for us to first and foremost recognize
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.680]   how insignificant we are,
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.680]   that we don't come into church saying,
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.680]   "What does it have for me?"
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.680]   We evaluate everything based upon, "What does it do for me?"
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.680]   Galatians 2:20, it says,
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.680]   "We have been crucified with Christ.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.680]   It is no longer us who live."
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.680]   And so our primary stumbling block as Christians
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.680]   is when we are the center,
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.680]   even though we don't say it, in the way that we live,
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.680]   we evaluate everything based upon how it affects me.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.680]   And so that's what we're trying to reverse.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.680]   The Bible tells us the first step of sanctification
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.680]   is recognize that we are lent.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.680]   We are just a mist that comes and goes.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.680]   That's why the psalmist says, "Help me to number my days
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.680]   so that I recognize how temporary I am."
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.680]   And so when Christ truly becomes the center,
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.680]   that's when we can really live
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.680]   because the life we live in our flesh
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.680]   usually goes against God.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.680]   So our primary thing, we want God to be exalted.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.680]   We want God to be the center.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.680]   So everything that we do, our question is,
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.680]   "Would they like it? Would people come?
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.680]   Is this the kind of church that our neighborhood wants?"
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.680]   That's not the question that we wrestle with.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.680]   The question that we are constantly wrestling with is,
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.680]   "Is God honored by what we do, whether people like it or not,
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.680]   whether the church grows or not?"
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.680]   Secondly, if we want to be God-centered,
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.680]   you have to be Word-centered.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:17.680]   You can't be God-centered if you are not in the Word
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.680]   because even God-centeredness can be us-centered
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.680]   if it is not centered on the Word of God.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.680]   We project what we think God wants
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.680]   based upon our desires and what we want Him to be.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.680]   And so in order to be God-centered,
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.680]   we have to be Word-centered.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.680]   So our natural question in the way that we do church
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.680]   is not, "Does it work?"
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.680]   Our primary question is, "Is it biblical?"
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.680]   Is that what the Bible teaches?
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.680]   What does the world think?
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.680]   That is not our primary concern.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.680]   Our primary concern is, "What does the Bible say?"
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.680]   The difference between a church that is centered around
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.680]   the shifting culture of our generation
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.680]   is that every time there's a movement, the church changes.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.680]   Their vocabulary changes. Their sermon changes.
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.680]   What is emphasized changes.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.680]   The culture of the church changes.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.680]   What is allowed in the church changes.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.680]   A Word-centered church never changes
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.680]   because the Word of God does not change.
[00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.680]   Whether it was 2,000 years ago, whether it is now,
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.680]   or whether hopefully 100 years from now,
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.680]   that what we believe in this church,
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.680]   what is practiced in this church,
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.680]   is not going to be any different than this generation,
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.680]   your generation, and our grandchildren's generation.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.680]   And so that's what we're trying to build in the church--
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:35.680]   God-centered church based upon the Word-centered church
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.680]   that is going to last.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.680]   It's not going to change because our culture is changing.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.680]   Obviously, based on that,
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.680]   that's the church that we're trying to build.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.680]   That's why when we talk about building a church
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:50.680]   in truth and love,
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.680]   it's never one or the other.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.680]   Every once in a while, we hear things like,
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.680]   "Well, we want to make a safe place,"
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:00.680]   because that's a term that's being used in our culture.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.680]   Because whether you're a Christian or not Christian,
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.680]   we need a safe place--
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.680]   a safe place at work, a safe place at school,
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.680]   a safe place at home, a safe place at church.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.680]   That type of language is not coming from the Word of God.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.680]   That kind of language is coming from our culture.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.680]   What we want in a church is not a safe place.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.680]   That's not our primary concern.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.680]   Our primary concern is where the truth is exalted,
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.680]   and sometimes the truth will cut.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.680]   And when non-Christians come to the presence of God,
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.680]   they should not feel safe.
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.680]   When they hear the Word of Christ
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:35.680]   and the gospel is proclaimed,
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.680]   and they leave after the clear teaching of the gospel,
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.680]   and they feel safe,
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.680]   the gospel was not presented properly
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.680]   because the gospel warns non-Christians
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.680]   that there is judgment coming.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.680]   So how can we create a safe place for non-Christians
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.680]   who are going to be judged if they do not repent
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.680]   and still in unrepentance feel safe?
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.680]   And so we want to make sure that we build a church
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.680]   based on love and accountability, right?
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:08.680]   That we want to practice love, but in the context of truth.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.680]   And so that's the church we want to build.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.680]   And then evangelism happens as a result of that.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.680]   You know, most people think that evangelism
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.680]   is the hardest part of the fourfold vision.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.680]   In reality, the fourth vision is actually the easiest part
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.680]   because you go to work, you talk to people.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.680]   You go to restaurants, you have friends, right?
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.680]   Tell me a single person here that doesn't have friends
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.680]   or doesn't talk to people, right?
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.680]   The only difference is when we're not sober
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.680]   and we're not walking right with God,
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.680]   the conversation is forced.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.680]   But when you're walking right with God and you're sober,
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.680]   it's like talking about anything else in your life.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.680]   If it's important in your heart, it will come out.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.680]   How hard is it for you to talk about
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.680]   the best movie that you've watched?
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.680]   How hard is it when you have this meal
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.680]   and it was the best sandwich that you had
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.680]   to go and tell your friend about it?
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.680]   It's not that hard, right?
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.680]   The reason why it's hard is because we're not sober
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.680]   in other areas, so we end up artificially,
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.680]   you know, manufacturing conversations
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.680]   that we normally would not have.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:11.680]   And so I share all of this because we want to be mindful
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.680]   of the kind of church that we're building, right?
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.680]   As our church continues to grow,
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.680]   whether we were 50 or 500 or 5,000,
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.680]   that our principles are not going to change.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.680]   We're not going to change.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.680]   Even if people come in and say,
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.680]   "Well, at my church we used to do this,
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.680]   and if we did this, more people will come,
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.680]   and my non-Christian friends will feel more comfortable
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.680]   if we did this."
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.680]   We can always improve on everything that we're doing,
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.680]   but fundamental things that we believe in the church
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.680]   will not change, cannot change,
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.680]   because it is word-centered, okay?
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.680]   So all of this, everything that I've said,
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.680]   obviously it's something that we go over
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.680]   in our church membership class,
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.680]   but in order to do all of this,
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.680]   it is all contingent upon our first vision,
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.680]   which is being God-centered.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.680]   If we're not meeting God,
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.680]   word of God becomes manufactured.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.680]   It becomes a source of pride
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.680]   instead of a source of tool or guidance, right?
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.680]   A church becomes more of a neighbor, a community,
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.680]   than really a place where we're carrying out the mission of God.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.680]   In evangelism, it's like pulling teeth, right?
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.680]   You're trying to sell something
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.680]   that you yourself don't believe or practice.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.680]   So all of it is contingent upon this first vision, right?
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.680]   Are we meeting God at church?
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.680]   What does Christ mean to you?
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.680]   And that's why we want to pray.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.680]   That's why our theme for this year was "Watch and to Pray."
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.680]   We have to--prayer is not one of many things
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.680]   that the church needs to do.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.680]   If we're not praying, everything else doesn't matter.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.680]   We're doing it by our own strength.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.680]   And so we're going to change things up today.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.680]   I'm going to--instead of giving you a chunk of time to pray,
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.680]   I'm going to lead you in prayer, okay?
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.680]   So I'm actually going to do something I haven't done in years.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.680]   I'm going to lead us in worship,
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.680]   and I'm going to ask you guys to join with me in worship.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:05.680]   And the songs that I picked are brand-new songs
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:10.680]   for those of you who are of certain age, okay?
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.680]   Because we don't sing them.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.680]   In fact, I don't think anybody sings them anymore.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.680]   So it may be new to some of you,
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.680]   and some of you who are a little bit older,
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.680]   it'll be more nostalgic.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.680]   And the reason why I picked those songs
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:27.680]   is because my repertoire is very small,
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.680]   and I pick songs that are easier for me to play.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.680]   That's one reason.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.680]   The other reason was I actually was hoping
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.680]   that Isaac and the team would be able to lead it,
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.680]   but when I gave him the songs,
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.680]   he didn't know more than half of it.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:47.680]   So he is of that age where he hasn't heard it, okay?
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.680]   The other reason why I chose these songs
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:53.680]   is because each one of these songs are songs of prayer.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.680]   So if you watch it, it's not just doxology.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.680]   We're not just repeating doctrine.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.680]   Each one of these songs are simple songs,
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.680]   but they're a prayer to God.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:06.680]   And so I'm going to lead you through the prayers,
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.680]   and so as we're sitting,
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.680]   I'm going to be repeating these songs,
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.680]   and so you don't have to follow along and say,
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.680]   "Oh, man, he's singing it three times already."
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.680]   But I want you to pay attention to the lyrics,
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.680]   and when you sing these songs,
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:24.680]   sing it as a prayer to God, okay?
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.680]   So when in the lyrics,
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.680]   there's a petition for God in the singing,
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:34.680]   sing it as if you are praying this prayer, right?
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.680]   Don't just mouth the words.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.680]   We're not here just to sing.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.680]   God is not pleased just because we have good voices, right?
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.680]   In fact, I remember years ago when I was in seminary,
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:46.680]   my seminary professor took all the students to a synagogue in L.A.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.680]   just so that we can experience what synagogue worship is like.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:54.680]   And I remember being there 90% of the time we sang,
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.680]   and they didn't just sing anything.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.680]   They just opened up the psalm,
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.680]   and he would recite something in Hebrew,
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.680]   and then the congregation would recite it back in Hebrew in song.
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.680]   And so the whole time we were there, maybe about 40, 45 minutes,
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:13.680]   it was singing, and then the rabbi would come up,
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.680]   and he would give a short exposition,
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.680]   and then they'd have celebration afterwards.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:20.680]   And he said that in the early church in the synagogues
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.680]   that this is what the worship looked like.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.680]   They would just literally open up the scriptures,
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.680]   and then they would sing it, right?
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:30.680]   And so a lot of the songs that we're going to be singing tonight
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:35.680]   are related to a particular psalm that is put into words,
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.680]   not all of them, but some of them.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.680]   And so I'll guide you through that as we go.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:42.680]   So I'm going to get positioned here.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:47.680]   So don't pay attention to the quality, okay,
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.680]   because I haven't--I haven't--you know,
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:52.680]   I really wrestled with whether I should do this or not
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.680]   because I don't want to be a distraction to you,
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:57.680]   but I really want you guys to pray.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.680]   I really want the songs that you sing
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.680]   be expression of your heart toward God, right?
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.680]   And so don't sit there like you're watching a concert.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.680]   Don't sit there like you're just singing a song.
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.680]   Really position yourself to pray.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.680]   So if you want to, you know, get somewhere,
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.680]   if you want to buy Epivirus, if you want to stand up,
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.680]   it's up to you, okay?
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.680]   But please use this opportunity to focus your attention
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.680]   to pray before God.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:23.680]   So let me get seated over here,
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.680]   and then I'll pray, and then we'll get started.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:33.680]   While I'm sitting up,
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:38.680]   just take a few minutes to pray on your own,
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.680]   to get ready, okay?
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:44.680]   And when I'm ready, I'll get started.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.680]   [Praying silently.]
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.680]   [Praying silently.]
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.680]   [Praying silently.]
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.680]   [Music playing.]
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:25.680]   [Music playing.]
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:29.680]   [Music playing.]
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.680]   [Music playing.]
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:59.680]   All right, let me pray for us and get started.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:07.680]   Heavenly Father, Lord, we gather together as a church
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.680]   to seek your face.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.680]   Whatever burdens that we have brought into this room,
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.680]   I pray, Lord God, that you would anoint this time, Lord God,
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.680]   that we may search you with all our hearts
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:24.680]   to seek, to ask, to knock.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.680]   Help us, Lord God, not to be casual in this time,
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.680]   but really to be able to know your heart.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:35.680]   Lord, use these songs to stir in our hearts, Lord God,
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.680]   the longing that these words would represent
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.680]   our very selves, Lord God.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.680]   So we pray for your anointing, we pray for your Holy Spirit
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.680]   to lead and guide us.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.680]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.680]   Before we get started, again, each one of these songs
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.680]   I'm going to try to introduce to you.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:55.680]   And again, as we sing, and then I'll see if, you know,
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.680]   I may extend it, I may not.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.680]   But during any of this time, if you want to pray,
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:05.680]   you know, as you're singing, just pray, you know,
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.680]   along with these words.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.680]   This is my desire, this is what I desire,
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.680]   and to just take some time to pray however you want to pray.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.680]   This first one that we're singing is "As We Seek Your Face."
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.680]   Again, this is a pretty simple song.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:23.680]   And the term "seeking your face," as we come before God,
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.680]   as I said, is not a casual seeking.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.680]   So if you look at 2 Chronicles 7, 14-15,
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:32.680]   and as they were dedicating the temple,
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.680]   after Solomon built it, it said,
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.680]   "And my people who are called by my name
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.680]   "humble themselves and pray and seek my face
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.680]   "and turn from their wicked ways.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.680]   "Then I will hear from heaven, will forgive their sin,
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.680]   "and will heal their land.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:48.680]   "Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.680]   "to the prayers offered in this place."
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.680]   And so the temple was dedicated as a place of prayer.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:58.680]   And the term that is used here, if they come and seek my face,
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:01.680]   seek my face isn't just a casual coming into the temple
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.680]   to drop off your offering and then to go home.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.680]   The idea of seeking your face is coming to Christ,
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:09.680]   coming to God in an intimate setting.
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.680]   Just like today, you may get a phone call
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.680]   or you may get an email, but if you want an intimate
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:18.680]   conversation with somebody, say, "Hey, let me see you face to face."
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:21.680]   And so that's the idea here when it says to seek God's face,
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.680]   that we're not just coming here to sing,
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.680]   to put words together for obligation,
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:30.680]   but a longing in our hearts to really be in his presence.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.680]   And so that's what this song is, as we seek your face,
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.680]   may we know your heart.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.680]   Not just to know you mentally, but your own heart.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:41.680]   And so as we sing it, hopefully this would be our prayers together.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:46.680]   [Music]
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:59.680]   As we seek your face, may we know your heart.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:05.680]   In your presence, acceptance.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:24.680]   As we seek your face, may we know your heart.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:30.680]   In your presence, acceptance.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:37.680]   As we seek your face, at your feet we fall.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:49.680]   At your feet we fall, sovereign man.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:41:02.680]   By daily, only at your feet we fall.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:14.680]   Jesus, strong and bold, personal to you.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:26.680]   Let the world around you be known.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:38.680]   Jesus, strong and bold, personal to you.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:48.680]   Let your eyes out and worship and your head.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.680]   Let's sing, as we seek your face.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:42:02.680]   As we seek your face, may we know your heart.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:08.680]   In your presence, acceptance.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:14.680]   As we seek your face, at your feet we fall.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:27.680]   At your feet we fall, sovereign man.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:37.680]   By daily, only at your feet we fall.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:52.680]   Jesus, strong and bold, personal to you.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:43:04.680]   Let the world around me fade away.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:16.680]   Jesus, strong and bold, personal to you.
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:38.680]   Let your eyes out and worship and your head.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.680]   The next worship psalm, as a dear packet for the water.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.680]   It comes from Psalm 42, one through five.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:50.680]   It's a psalm written during the captivity in Babylon.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:55.680]   And it was a psalm just longing for God, wanting to be at the
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.680]   temple and to worship.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:02.680]   And so the psalmist is singing, I long for you, I desire you.
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:06.680]   Because they miss the corporate worship at the temple so much.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:11.680]   And so the part that I really enjoy singing, as a dear packet
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:16.680]   for the water, so my soul longeth after thee.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.680]   And you alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship you.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.680]   Again, it comes from Psalm 42, one through five.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.680]   Let me read it for you.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:28.680]   Psalm 42, as a dear pants for the books, so my soul pants for
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.680]   you, oh God.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.680]   My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.680]   When shall I come and appear before God?
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.680]   My tears have been my food day and night.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.680]   For they say to me all day long, where is your God?
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:46.680]   These things I remember and I pour out my soul within me.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.680]   For I used to go along with the throng and lead them in
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.680]   procession to the house of God.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.680]   With the voice of joy and thanksgiving, a multitude
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.680]   keeping festival.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.680]   Why are you in despair, oh my soul, and why have you become
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.680]   disturbed within me?
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.680]   Hope in God, for I shall again praise him for the help of his
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.680]   presence.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:09.680]   So again, I pray that you would take it to heart, right.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.680]   Don't attend prayer.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:14.680]   Don't attend worship.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:16.680]   Worship.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.680]   Come to pray.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:22.680]   So if your posture is -- I am just going to sit here and watch.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.680]   Let's see how this thing goes.
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.680]   I hope that you would really engage.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.680]   And if your heart is hardened, maybe you are distracted by
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.680]   something, pray.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.680]   You don't have to sit, just sit there and pray and seek God.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:37.680]   I am so entangled with things that I shouldn't have been
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.680]   entangled with.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.680]   And I just don't have that heart.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:45.680]   To take time to pray and really seek the Lord, seek his face.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:50.680]   So I want you to sing these songs and sing it as your words.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.680]   Right.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:54.680]   Not the psalmist, not some song that was written.
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.680]   But these are your words.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:58.680]   I long to have you.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:00.680]   I may not be there but this is my desire.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:05.680]   I long to have you.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:19.680]   As the dew planted for the water so my soul longed after thee.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:30.680]   You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee.
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:32.680]   As the dew planted for the water.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:46.680]   As the dew planted for the water so my soul longed after thee.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:59.680]   You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:05.680]   You alone are my strength, my shield.
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:13.680]   To you alone may my spirit lead.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:26.680]   You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee.
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:39.680]   You're my friend and you are my brother even though you are a king.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:49.680]   I love you more than any other soul, much more than anything.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.680]   You alone.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:58.680]   You alone are my strength, my shield.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:06.680]   To you alone may my spirit lead.
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:16.680]   You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.680]   You alone.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:24.680]   You alone are my strength, my shield.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:33.680]   To you alone may my spirit lead.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:46.680]   You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:58.680]   I want you more than gold or silver only you can satisfy.
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:08.680]   You alone are the real joy giver and the apple of my eye.
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:10.680]   You alone.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:16.680]   You alone are my strength, my shield.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:24.680]   To you alone may my spirit lead.
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:36.680]   You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:42.680]   And I long to worship thee.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:56.680]   [Music]
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:00.680]   Father, that truly is our desire.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:04.680]   Lord, I pray that you will stir in our hearts a longing for you,
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.680]   Father God, that this world cannot satisfy.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:12.680]   Help us, Lord God, in our weakness, in our tempted minds and hearts,
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:16.680]   Lord God, that it's been compromised because the material things,
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:19.680]   the compromises, Lord, that we've allowed in our hearts.
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:24.680]   I pray as this psalm, as this song, Lord God, longs and yearns that this
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:29.680]   would be our true desire, that this would be our prayer.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.680]   I pray that you would build a church in this generation, Lord God,
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:38.680]   that our love would not grow cold because of the increase of wickedness.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.680]   Help us, Lord, to cling to you with all our might.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:45.680]   Lord, that as the deer panteth for the water,
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:49.680]   that we would long for you more than anything else.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:55.680]   Amen.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.680]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:01.680]   I know that each week there's different things that we wrestle with.
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.680]   You know, we come on Sunday and we get convicted or, you know,
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:09.680]   a Bible study or you hear people's testimony, but as soon as we go home,
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.680]   there's Netflix, bills to pay, children to raise,
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:15.680]   and we are so easily entangled.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:20.680]   And so this song, again, is a reminder that in the midst of entanglement,
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:23.680]   that we need Christ more than anything else.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.680]   In 1 Timothy 6, 9 through 10, it says,
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:29.680]   "Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare,
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:33.680]   and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and destruction.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.680]   For the love of money is the root of all sorts of evil,
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.680]   and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.680]   and pierced themselves with many griefs."
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:43.680]   We have to make money.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.680]   We have to pay bills.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:47.680]   We want to be wise in making investments.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:51.680]   But if we don't guard our hearts, that becomes our primary concern,
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:55.680]   that we can easily be fooled to think that my greatest calling as a father
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:59.680]   or a mother is to make a lot of money and provide for our children.
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.680]   And next thing we know, our hearts are far from God.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:04.680]   And it's not money itself.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.680]   It's a love of money.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:08.680]   And nobody thinks that they're pursuing the love of money.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:11.680]   It just happens in the context of I've got to be a good father.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.680]   I've got to take care of my kids.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.680]   I've got to be responsible.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.680]   But if we're not careful, the love of money creeps in,
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:24.680]   and that becomes our primary pursuit without us ever making a decision.
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:29.680]   In 2 Timothy 4:10 it says, "For Demas, having loved this present world,
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.680]   has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica."
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:36.680]   Demas, if you know, in scripture was one of Paul's travel companions.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:39.680]   He suffered along with Paul.
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:41.680]   He went to jail along with Paul.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.680]   He was stoned along with Paul.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:46.680]   But at the tail end when he was about to be executed,
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:50.680]   Demas had enough, and he packed up his bags and went home.
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.680]   And if you notice, it says he went back to Thessalonica.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:55.680]   You know, we've been studying through Thessalonica,
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:59.680]   and Thessalonica was a model church that in the context of much persecution,
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:03.680]   they persevered, and they were so--Paul was so encouraged to hear the news,
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:08.680]   and yet at the end, it says Demas, one of the key figures in this church,
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:12.680]   ended up being tempted, and he packed up his bag and left.
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.680]   No one is exempt from this temptation.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:19.680]   So if we don't fight to guard our hearts, this will happen.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.680]   It's not--it can happen.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.680]   It does happen, right?
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:27.680]   And so this song kind of, you know, helps us to focus our attention.
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:31.680]   At just the time that I think that I'm at peace with the world that's mine, right?
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.680]   No one's sick. My bills are paid.
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:35.680]   My job is great. My family is great.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:39.680]   But I feel at ease. I feel at home, and I know I'm not alone.
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:43.680]   Then in my rest, there comes a test that shakes me till again I know
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:47.680]   that what I had is not enough, and again, I've got to grow.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.680]   This probably is a lot of us.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:52.680]   There's nothing urgent happening.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:56.680]   Kids are well-fed, have a good job, you know,
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:59.680]   you have money being saved in the retirement,
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:02.680]   but your heart is not where it needs to be.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:07.680]   And so God reminds us, right, to examine our hearts so that we do not drift.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:11.680]   So at just the time I think that I'm at peace with the world that's mine.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.680]   [music]
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:27.680]   At just the time I think that I'm at peace with the world that's mine.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:33.680]   I feel at ease. I feel at home.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:40.680]   And I know I'm not alone.
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:52.680]   Then in my rest, there comes a test that shakes me till again I know
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:55:02.680]   that what I had is not enough, and again, I've got to grow.
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:04.680]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:09.680]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:14.680]   Deep within my heart, I want to know you.
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:17.680]   Lord, I want to know you.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:26.680]   And I will give my final breath to know you in your death and resurrection.
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:32.680]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:36.680]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.680]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:43.680]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:48.680]   Deep within my heart, I want to know you.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:51.680]   Lord, I want to know you.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:56:00.680]   And I will give my final breath to know you in your death and resurrection.
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:06.680]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:13.680]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:25.680]   The full supply I'll find as I move closer to the heart of God
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:38.680]   to strengthen me, to nourish me, and to fill my mind with him.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:47.680]   I've truly grown, but even so, my hunger hasn't gone away.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:57:03.680]   Still I long, so I thirst to know him more each day.
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:07.680]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:12.680]   Deep within my heart, I want to know you.
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:15.680]   Lord, I want to know you.
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:24.680]   And I will give my final breath to know you in your death and resurrection.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:30.680]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:34.680]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:35.680]   Let's sing one more time.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.680]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.680]   And really make it our longing for God.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:41.680]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:45.680]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:50.680]   Deep within my heart, I want to know you.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:53.680]   Lord, I want to know you.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:58:02.680]   And I will give my final breath to know you in your death and resurrection.
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:08.680]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:15.680]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:21.680]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:32.680]   As we've been going through Hebrews, the section that we studied a couple weeks ago,
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:37.680]   Hebrews 12, 12-13 says, "Therefore, strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble,
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:42.680]   and make straight paths for your feet, so that the limb which is lame may not be put out of joint,
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:44.680]   but rather be healed."
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:48.680]   And again, this is a description of someone who is just fatigued.
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:54.680]   And maybe some of us came into this room with struggles, which I know,
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:57.680]   there's been a lot of stuff that's been going on.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:02.680]   And again, you know, obviously this is not something I can share, but we've been praying for you.
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:06.680]   And I know there's other people that you haven't shared.
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:11.680]   There's heartaches, some of you have lost loved ones, some of you going through various things.
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:15.680]   And maybe just fatigue, you know, you're fighting your sin,
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:18.680]   and it just seems like you're going in circles over and over again.
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.680]   Maybe you're having marriage problems.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:24.680]   Maybe you have, you know, longings that you've been praying for that you feel like God's not answering,
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:27.680]   and sometimes you're just fatigued and tired.
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:30.680]   And so that's what Hebrews 12, 12-13 is describing.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:35.680]   And again, as we said a couple weeks ago, where we are promised by God
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:43.680]   that God does not turn away a broken reed or, you know, even a little wick that's been burned, right?
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:47.680]   And so this song is "Precious Lord, Take My Hand" is somebody who is fatigued,
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:51.680]   just longing and crying out to God, like, "I need your help."
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:55.680]   So if you know the song, please sing it a little bit louder so that I can follow.
[00:59:55.680 --> 01:00:00.680]   Okay, but again, let's make this our longing and praying together.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:10.680]   Precious Lord, take my hand, lead me on, let me stand.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:20.680]   I am tired, I am weak, I am worn.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:30.680]   Through the storm, through the night, lead me on to the light.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:37.680]   Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me on.
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.680]   So one more time, precious Lord.
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:49.680]   Precious Lord, take my hand, lead me on, let me stand.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:59.680]   I am tired, I am weak, I am worn.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:08.680]   Through the storm, through the night, lead me on to the light.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:18.680]   Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me on.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:28.680]   When my way grows drear, precious Lord, linger near.
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:37.680]   When my love is almost gone.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:42.680]   Hear my cry, hear my call.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:47.680]   Hold my hand, lest I fall.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:56.680]   Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me on.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:06.680]   When the darkness appears and the night draws near,
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:20.680]   and the day is past and gone, at the river I stand.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:27.680]   Guide my feet, hold my hand, take my hand.
[01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.680]   Precious Lord, lead me on.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.680]   Precious Lord, take my hand.
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.680]   Precious Lord, lead me on.
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.680]   Precious Lord, take my hand.
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.680]   Precious Lord, lead me on.
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.680]   Precious Lord, take my hand.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.680]   Precious Lord, lead me on.
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.680]   Precious Lord, take my hand.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.680]   Precious Lord, lead me on.
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.680]   Precious Lord, take my hand.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.680]   Precious Lord, lead me on.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:04.680]   Precious Lord, take my hand.
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:09.680]   Precious Lord, lead me on.
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:12.680]   Before we sing the next song, why don't we take a few minutes
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:15.680]   and come before the Lord individually.
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.680]   And just pray before God.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:20.680]   The songs that we sang and the things that you brought into
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:21.680]   this room.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:24.680]   And take some time to pray on your own before we move on to
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:25.680]   the next song.

[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:06.900]   People who are lost.
[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:09.900]   And to really be a light for them.
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:10.900]   And to pray for them.
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:11.900]   Intercede for them.
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:12.900]   Okay.
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:17.900]   So make me a prayer, let my prayers be a cry.
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:19.920]   Not just empty prayer.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:20.920]   Not just words.
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:21.920]   But a cry.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:22.920]   A longing in my heart.
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:26.920]   Humble my heart so that you may draw nigh.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.920]   Cause me to stand and cry out for this land.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.920]   Cause me to be one who is set free.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:36.920]   To stand as a house of prayer.
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:40.940]   Cause me to stand out, cry out for this land.
[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:46.940]   When was the last time you cried out to God for sinners to come
[01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:49.940]   to Christ?
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.940]   So if it's hard to pray that, sing it.
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:53.940]   Right.
[01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:54.940]   That this is our desire.
[01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:56.940]   This is what I desire.
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:00.940]   That this song would lead us to pray and cry out on behalf of
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:01.960]   our generation.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:11.960]   [Music]
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:15.960]   Make me a prayer.
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:20.960]   Let my prayers be a cry.
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:29.960]   Humble my heart so that you may draw nigh.
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:38.980]   Cause me to stand and cry out for this land.
[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:46.980]   Cause me to be one who is set free.
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:53.980]   To stand as a house of prayer.
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:56.980]   Make me a prayer.
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:09:00.000]   Make me a prayer.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   Let my prayers be a cry.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   Humble my heart so that you may draw nigh.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:22.980]   Cause me to stand and cry out for this land.
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:30.980]   Cause me to be one who is set free.
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:37.980]   To stand as a house of prayer.
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:40.980]   Make us a prayer.
[01:09:40.980 --> 01:09:43.980]   Make us a prayer.
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:48.980]   Let our prayers be a cry.
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:57.960]   Humble our heart so that you may draw nigh.
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:06.960]   Cause us to stand and cry out for this land.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:14.960]   Cause us to be one who is set free.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:20.960]   To stand as a house of prayer.
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.960]   Make us a prayer.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:27.960]   Make us a prayer.
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:32.960]   Let our prayers be a cry.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:41.960]   Humble our heart so that you may draw nigh.
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:48.960]   Cause us to stand and cry out for this land.
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.960]   Call us to stand.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:56.960]   Cause us to stand and cry out for this land.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:58.960]   Call us to stand.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:06.960]   Cause us to stand and cry out for this land.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:15.960]   To stand as a house of prayer.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:20.960]   Lord we pray that You would cause our church to be a place
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.960]   where we can come to pray together.
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:25.960]   To cry out for our generation, Lord God.
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:29.960]   Lord I pray that the reality of Your salvation and Your judgment
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.960]   will become more and more real to us, Lord God.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.960]   That we may live sober lives.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.960]   Help us, Lord God, to see this generation.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:41.960]   Our brothers, our sisters, our friends, Lord God, who do not know You.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.960]   That we would ache on their behalf.
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:48.960]   That we would be on our knees crying out, Lord God, for their salvation.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:51.960]   So we pray, Father, that You would make us a house of prayer.
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:53.960]   Individually and together, Lord.
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:59.960]   That You would help us open our eyes to see that this generation will pass.
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:03.960]   And so we pray, Father God, that the time and the opportunity, the gifts,
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:06.960]   the finances, the freedom that we have,
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:10.960]   help us to be all poured out, Lord God, for the sake of Your name.
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:16.960]   [Music]
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:21.960]   After we sing this last song,
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:25.960]   I'm going to ask you guys to take some time to pray together.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:28.960]   This is the only song that isn't necessarily in prayer.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:35.960]   But I want you to, again, because this represents, I think, all our testimony.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.960]   To remember what He saved us from, where we're at,
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:41.960]   what it is that we have, right?
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.960]   And this is, we may have come to Christ in different ways,
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.960]   but this is all our testimony.
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:49.960]   I once was lost in darkest night, yet thought I knew the way.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.960]   The sin that promised joy in life had led me to the grave.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:56.960]   Had no hope that You would own a rebel to Your own.
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.960]   And if You had not loved me first, I would refuse to steal.
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:01.960]   Hallelujah, all I have is Christ.
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.960]   Hallelujah, Jesus is my life.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:11.960]   [Music]
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:21.960]   I once was lost in darkest night, yet thought I knew the way.
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:31.960]   The sin that promised joy in life had led me to the grave.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:41.960]   Had no hope that You would own a rebel to Your own.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:53.960]   And if You had not loved me first, I would refuse to steal.
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:14:03.960]   Hallelujah, all I have is Christ.
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:13.960]   Hallelujah, Jesus is my life.
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:23.960]   Hallelujah, all I have is Christ.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:33.960]   Hallelujah, Jesus is my life.
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:42.960]   But as I ran my hell-bound race, indifferent to the cost,
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:51.960]   You looked upon my helpless state and led me to the cross.
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:15:00.960]   And I beheld God's love display. You suffered in my place.
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:11.960]   You bore the wrath reserved for me. And all I know is grace.
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:20.960]   Hallelujah, all I have is Christ.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:29.960]   Hallelujah, Jesus is my life.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:37.960]   Hallelujah, all I have is Christ.
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:48.960]   Hallelujah, Jesus is my life.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:57.960]   Now Lord, I would be Yours alone and live so mighty.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:06.960]   The strength to follow Your commands could never come from me.
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:15.960]   Oh Father, use my ransomed life in any way You choose.
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:26.960]   Let my song forever be my only voice is You.
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:34.960]   Hallelujah, all I have is Christ.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:42.960]   Hallelujah, Jesus is my life.
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:51.960]   Hallelujah, all I have is Christ.
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:17:04.960]   Hallelujah, Jesus is my life.
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:10.960]   Lord, we pray that this would truly be our longing and our sincere prayer
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:15.960]   that we would recognize Lord God that all we have is Christ.
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:18.960]   And all we desire is Christ.
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:23.960]   Help us Lord God to seek Your face, not only tonight, but every day Father God.
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:26.960]   To know You, to love You, to proclaim You.
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:30.960]   We be the greatest passion that consumes our thoughts and our hearts.
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:36.960]   Help us Lord God to seek You as a dear pandith for the water.
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.960]   That we would long for Your presence.
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:41.960]   That we would drink of Your water and eat of Your bread.
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:45.960]   That we would find this joy Father God that can only be found in You.
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:49.960]   Help us never to forget what it is that we have been saved from.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:55.960]   That our worship Lord God will be an overflowing thanksgiving in our hearts to You.
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:59.960]   So I pray that as we have sung and as we have prayed,
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:03.960]   help us Lord God to be a church that lives up to our prayers.
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:06.960]   We thank You Father in Jesus' name, we pray.
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:10.960]   So if I can break you guys up into groups of maybe about three.
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:13.960]   And I'm going to just give you about 10 minutes, maybe two or three.
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:16.960]   Just grab some people around you, take some time to pray.
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.960]   If you have urgent things that you want to share and pray, you can pray for that.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.960]   Otherwise, just take some time to pray for each other just generally.
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.960]   And then I'm going to call you up in about 10 minutes.
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:28.960]   Our worship team is going to come up and they're going to wrap us up.
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:32.960]   So if you can turn the lights on right now.
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:37.960]   And then just grab two or three people around you and turn your chairs around
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:40.960]   and take some time to pray.
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.960]   You only have about 10 minutes.

[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:06.960]   For those of us who are still praying, please continue to do so.
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:12.960]   If not, let us all rise as we close this night with this song of adoration, "How Great Thou Art."
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:30.960]   [Music]
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:32.960]   >> Oh Lord, my God.
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:36.960]   >> Oh Lord, my God.
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:48.960]   When I in awesome wonder consider all the works Thy hands have made.
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:52.960]   I see the stars.
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:32:04.960]   I hear the rolling thunder that hath rewound the universe to sleep.
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:12.960]   Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee.
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:16.960]   How great Thou art.
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:20.960]   How great Thou art.
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:28.960]   Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee.

[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:40.960]   How great Thou art.
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:58.960]   And when I think that God his Son, thus bearing, sent him to die, I scarce can take it in.
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:14.960]   That on that cross, my burden lightly bearing, he bled and died to take away my sin.
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:22.960]   Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee.
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:26.960]   How great Thou art.
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:30.960]   How great Thou art.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:38.960]   Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee.

[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:58.960]   [Music]
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:00.960]   Christ shall come.
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:16.960]   When Christ shall come, with a shout of affirmation, and take me home, with joy shall fill my heart.
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:32.960]   Then I shall bow, with love of adoration, and there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art.
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:42.960]   Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee.
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:46.960]   How great Thou art.
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:50.960]   How great Thou art.
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:58.960]   Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee.
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:02.960]   How great Thou art.
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:06.960]   How great Thou art.
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:14.960]   Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee.
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:18.960]   How great Thou art.
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:22.960]   How great Thou art.
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:30.960]   Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee.
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:36.960]   How great Thou art.
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:40.960]   How great Thou art.
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:44.960]   How great Thou art.
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:50.960]   How great Thou art.
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:58.960]   [Music]
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:00.960]   Amen. Let us bow and pray together.
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:06.960]   Our God, we absolutely believe that you are mighty and powerful.
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:10.960]   And God, you are great beyond our imagination and what our minds can perceive.
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:14.960]   Help us, Father God, to know you in greater light.
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:19.960]   Help us, Father God, to thirst for you, that we may know you in every facet of who you are.
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:25.960]   Lord, we repent of the fact that sometimes we are experts in different fields, markets, ideologies, and more.
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:32.960]   And yet, Father God, we do not exercise the same kind of intentionality to come to know you.
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:34.960]   But Lord, we desire more.
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:37.960]   Father, we want to love you to greater depths.
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:41.960]   Father God, we want to experience walking with you in greater faith.
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:45.960]   And so I pray that this would be our regular experience day to day.
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:51.960]   Lord, we do pray that anybody in here who is struggling with faith, would your word minister to them.
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:54.960]   Father, would your spirit convict them.
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:56.960]   And God, illuminate their eyes.
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:02.960]   And for every single one of us, Lord, truly desired to walk with you, we recognize that it is a battle.
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:08.960]   Help us, Father God, with great dependency, yet in the power of your spirit, in the power of your word, to persevere.
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:13.960]   We thank you for this night, Lord. We lift all things to you in Christ's name. Amen.
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:15.960]   Good evening, everybody.
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:17.960]   Just a real quick announcement.
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:19.960]   Please stick around for fellowship.
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:27.960]   For the BAM individuals, we have extended fellowship time in the cafe that you can join us there for snacks and time to hang out with each other.
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:29.960]   Thanks again, everyone. Good night.
