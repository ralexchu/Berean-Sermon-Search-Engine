[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.800]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   We will now begin our service.

[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:47.640]   - All right, good morning.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.640]   You can tell by the way I'm dressed
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.640]   I'm not preaching this morning.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.640]   Okay, Pastor Nate actually injured his Achilles heels.
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.640]   He's supposed to be preaching today.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.560]   And so he can't come up here twice.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.560]   I don't know how he's gonna come up here even once.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.560]   But I'm here to give the announcements on his behalf.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.560]   Again, welcome to Broom Community Church.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.560]   Happy Father's Day.
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.560]   If you have forgotten, shame on you.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.560]   But today is Father's Day.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.560]   So after the service, there's two locations
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.560]   where there's gonna be pictures taken
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.560]   kind of like the Mother's Day.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.560]   So the first one is in front of the seats
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.560]   as you're coming in.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.560]   You'll probably saw a green sign out there
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.560]   that says Father's Day.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.560]   So that's one of the places
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.560]   where the picture's being taken.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.480]   And then the other place is also in the cafe.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.480]   We have two areas
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.480]   because last time we had Mother's Day
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.480]   it kind of took too long to go through
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.480]   the different people that are coming in.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.480]   And so we have both places.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.480]   And I believe that there is a free gift
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.480]   for all the fathers.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.480]   I'm not sure what the book is,
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.480]   but there's a free book
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.480]   that's gonna be given to the father.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.480]   So when you go take the picture,
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.480]   you'll be able to have that.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.480]   This coming week, we have Praise and Prayer
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.480]   at 7.30 p.m. in this room.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.480]   So please come to that.
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.400]   And then there's a newcomer's lunch
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.400]   that's happening on June 26th,
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.400]   next Sunday at 1.15 p.m.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.400]   So if you're new to the church
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.400]   and you wanna learn more
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.400]   about what's going on in the church
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.400]   or just ask some questions
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.400]   about how things are organized,
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.400]   what are some of our priorities
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.400]   and meet some of the leaders in the church,
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.400]   there's a great opportunity
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.400]   for you to sign up for that.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.400]   So that's taking place on next Sunday.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.400]   Just let the newcomer's new welcome team members
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   know that you're planning to come
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.400]   and they'll prepare lunch for that.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.400]   Childcare training.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.400]   If you are serving in any capacity
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.400]   with the children,
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.400]   if you've been a member of the church
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.400]   for over a year
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.400]   and you are signed up for that,
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.400]   there is a training that's going on
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.400]   on July 3rd at 1.00 p.m.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.400]   So please mark that on your calendar
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.400]   to come to that.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.400]   And then finally,
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.400]   we have a new round of membership class
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.400]   that's taking place starting from July 10th
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.400]   at 9.00 a.m.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.400]   It is an eight-week course
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.400]   and so through the eight weeks
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.400]   that's taking place on Sunday mornings
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.400]   at 9.00 a.m. to 10.20 a.m.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.400]   It's at the second floor
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.400]   in the Seeds Room.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.400]   And during the eight weeks
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.400]   we go over the various fundamental doctrines
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.400]   of Christianity and ministry philosophy,
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.400]   how the church is organized.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.400]   We go through your personal testimony
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.400]   and then at the end of that
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.400]   we have a covenant signing
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.400]   where you become a member.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.400]   So if you are interested
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.400]   in becoming a member of the church,
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.400]   please sign up for that.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.400]   And Pastor Nate is actually the one
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.400]   who's in charge of it
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.400]   so please let him know
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.400]   that you're coming to that
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.400]   and there will be separate sign-ups
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.400]   if you desire to do so.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   And again, that's starting
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.400]   from July 10th at 9.00 a.m.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.400]   Okay.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.400]   All right, I think that's all
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   the announcements for this morning
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.400]   so after we'll give you a minute
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.400]   to give your offering online
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.400]   and then if you have a physical offer
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.400]   you want to give,
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.400]   again, we have an offering box
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.400]   underneath where it says "Compassion"
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.400]   and there's a clock there.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.400]   Underneath that there's an offering box.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.400]   You can drop it off there
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.400]   after service.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.400]   Okay.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.400]   All right, let's pray.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.320]   Gracious Father,

[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.320]   Yeah, I tore my, I probably tore my Achilles.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.320]   I'm gonna go into a doctor this week.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.320]   I played it, playing Capture the Flag
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.320]   with the college students.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.320]   (laughs)
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.320]   That's the end of the story.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.320]   Now you don't have to ask me anymore.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.320]   I'm doing just fine.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.320]   It hurts a little bit.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.320]   We'll move on.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.320]   If you see me walking by,
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.320]   now you know what happened.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.320]   Okay.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.320]   Cool.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.320]   Can you turn with me to Philippians chapter four?
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:39.320]   And happy Father's Day for everyone.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.320]   This sermon isn't about fathers,
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.320]   but I hope that because it's to everyone,
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.320]   I guess it includes you,
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.320]   make sure to pick up the photo frames
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.320]   and the gift, and you are very appreciated.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.320]   Hope you feel very loved by your family this day.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:58.320]   Now, we're not gonna read this just yet,
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.320]   but I wanted to open by kind of mentioning
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   the title of the sermon, Where is Your Mind?
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.320]   And the thought of what we're thinking upon
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.320]   is so much more than just the passing thoughts.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.320]   The question I'm asking is more
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.320]   the passage we're gonna be looking at,
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.320]   which is what are we dwelling on?
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.320]   What have we been largely, regularly,
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.320]   deeply thinking about lately?
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.320]   And those are the things that are gonna be
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.320]   very important for us to consider,
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.320]   especially in this day and age
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.320]   where we're constantly bombarded
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.320]   by all the noise of culture
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.320]   and everything that's going on.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.320]   And there's not a one of us.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.320]   It doesn't matter if we're not on technology.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.320]   We're just constantly being bombarded by so much.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.320]   And we have to be made aware of this
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.320]   and understand that as things are coming,
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.320]   if we're just passively allowing these things
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.320]   to wash over us, and there is no movement there,
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.320]   and then we come to God to worship
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.320]   and say that we surrender our lives to him
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.320]   without actively surrendering our thoughts
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.320]   and our thinking and our dwelling and our meditating,
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.320]   then we are in for a losing battle.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.320]   And so I wanted to address this today,
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.320]   especially in the realm, I guess,
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.320]   of like the smartphone.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.320]   Everywhere we go, everywhere we go,
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.320]   we have things just in us.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.320]   I know a lot of us have those earbuds,
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.320]   constantly music and podcasts.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.320]   You're in the car and you're listening to things.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.320]   It's very difficult to find yourself
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.320]   in a place where there's nothing
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.320]   to kind of barge you with.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.320]   There's that common fear nowadays
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.320]   where if you go to the bathroom,
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.320]   you don't have your phone on you.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.320]   You're like, oh no.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.320]   You know, there's those kind of fears that are there.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.320]   And it's because of this generation that we live in.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.320]   But it is not, I don't think it's the Bible's silent
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.320]   about it.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.320]   I think the Bible has already addressed it.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.320]   And we need to be made aware of this.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.320]   A man by the name of Alistair Begg,
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.320]   he says this, he says, "Our thoughts reveal more
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.320]   "about the true character of our lives
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.320]   "than any other thing.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.320]   "When our actions follow our thinking,
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.320]   "then we give testimony to our thoughts.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.320]   "But when we conceal our thoughts,
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.320]   "known only to God and ourselves,
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.320]   "they are a true monitor of who we are and what we are."
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.320]   And I think that was a very convicting statement
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:09.320]   because we can very easily change our words
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.320]   and we can present ourselves to one another,
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.320]   but our thoughts are our thoughts.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.320]   What we're dwelling on, honestly speaking,
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.320]   I have no idea what you've been dwelling on,
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.320]   for many of you.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.320]   Some of you, yes, but not all of you.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.320]   And if we're to look around,
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.320]   how many people know what you've been actually,
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.320]   actively thinking on, dwelling upon?
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.320]   And they might not know.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.320]   On the other hand, they might know very well
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.320]   what you've been dwelling on, right?
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.320]   And that's not so much a comfort either
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.320]   'cause you're always angry, you know,
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.320]   or you're always talking about this thing
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.320]   that you've been dwelling on.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.320]   That's not good either.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.320]   And so there are these things about our thoughts
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.320]   that I think I wanted to just really address today
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.320]   because it's been something that has constantly
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.320]   been plaguing me, especially, not selective to,
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.320]   but especially the last few years
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.320]   and the craziness that we've been seeing around us.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.320]   So again, title of the sermon, "Where is Your Mind?"
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.320]   It's going to require you to ask this of yourself.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.320]   Like, what have you been actively dwelling on?
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.320]   What are these recurring thoughts,
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.320]   these things that have been captivating your attentions
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.320]   and your motivations have been being affected
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.320]   by your thoughts, these things that have causing emotions
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.320]   to erupt inside of you?
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.320]   What is that?
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.320]   And the question that follows that is,
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.320]   are they appropriate to the Christian?
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:36.320]   Have they been causing in you the fruit of the Spirit?
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.320]   Can you say, looking at the thoughts of your heart,
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.320]   that this is unto God's glory,
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.320]   that these thoughts are actively,
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.320]   I can see the change and the good that it causes
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.320]   in me and those around me?
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.320]   Let me read for us Philippians chapter four, verse eight.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.320]   "Finally, brethren, whatever is true,
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.320]   "whatever is honorable, whatever is right,
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.320]   "whatever is pure, whatever is lovely,
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.320]   "whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.320]   "and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.320]   "The things you have learned and received and heard
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.320]   "and seen in me, practice these things,
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.320]   "and the God of peace will be with you."
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.320]   Let's pray.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:18.320]   Heavenly Father, I pray that we would be a thinking,
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.320]   dwelling people, but the things in which we think
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.320]   and dwell upon would be the things that pertain to you.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.320]   Father, help us.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:30.320]   We are in such great need of your care.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:34.320]   Holy Spirit, we need you to be changing us inside.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.320]   And Father, would you cause us to be people
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.320]   who would obediently respond.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.320]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.320]   All right, three points today.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.320]   First point is that we dwell on things.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.320]   And what I mean by this is that as humans,
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.320]   we dwell on things, this is just a given.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.320]   And that's the word that's being talked about there
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.320]   at the end of verse eight when it says,
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.320]   dwell on these things.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.320]   That word dwell is think.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.320]   Now this passage, it begins with finally, brethren.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.320]   And the reason why it's because this is kind of
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.320]   an umbrella term and it kind of starts to push together
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.320]   everything that he's been talking about.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.320]   We find that word also in the beginning of chapter three.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.320]   And so he's using it as a device to help kind of
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.320]   push everything together and say, here we go.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.320]   And he says, finally, brethren.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.320]   And he delves into these things that he calls us
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.320]   to think upon.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.320]   Philippians chapter one through three,
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.320]   we already saw and many of us are very familiar
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.320]   that the Apostle Paul is writing this in the presence
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.320]   of when he's in prison, right?
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.320]   And so he's displaying to the church of Philippi
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.320]   the hope that he has and what he desires for them to have.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.320]   And that's a very challenging thing for people
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.320]   who are living their lives to be receiving a letter
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.320]   from a brother who's in jail, right?
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.320]   Who's been suffering.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.320]   And for him to tell them, be joyful.
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.320]   That's so challenging, isn't it?
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.320]   So challenging because you begin to look at your lives
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:06.320]   like, what right do I have in the presence that I'm in
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.320]   to not be joyful when Paul's in prison saying,
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:12.320]   be joyful, right?
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.320]   And so, but that's kind of what's going on here.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.320]   And then in Philippians chapter four, verse one,
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.320]   at the beginning there, I think that imperative,
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.320]   stand firm.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.320]   Therefore, my beloved brethren, whom I long to see
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.320]   my joy and my crown in this way, stand firm in the Lord,
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.320]   my beloved.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.320]   That imperative pushes off into a litany of other
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.320]   imperatives that I think all fall under the main imperative
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.320]   of stand firm.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:38.320]   He's telling them how not to just be taken this way
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:42.320]   and that way, how to be resolute and convicted
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.320]   and strong and foundational.
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.320]   How it doesn't matter if we're up or we're down,
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.320]   if we're in places of dire need or we're in places
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.320]   of great abundance.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.320]   He's showing us what it looks like and how we're called
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:59.320]   to live unmoving and stable because of something
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:03.320]   that we have in Jesus Christ.
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.320]   That's where we get this.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.320]   He says dwell.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.320]   The word dwell is a command to us.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.320]   To dwell, Paul knew that as humans we dwell on things.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.320]   It's part of what it is to be humans.
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.320]   There are those of us who are deep thinkers.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.320]   We lay down in bed before sleeping and the thoughts
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.320]   just like this, chasing the tail.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.320]   It's hard to turn it off.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.320]   And there are those who are just like very simple-minded.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.320]   You might think like, oh, I'm not a thinker.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.320]   We're all thinkers.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.320]   We all dwell on things.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:43.320]   He's speaking into the human reality.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.320]   Dwell.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.320]   In the LSB, it says consider.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:50.320]   In most other translations, though, it just says think.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.320]   To think upon this list that we're gonna be going
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.320]   into in a moment.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.320]   This word dwell means to calculate or to reason over,
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.320]   to ponder, to remember, to bear in mind.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.320]   It's something that's so important to you that you're
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:07.320]   revisiting it multiple times over and over again.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.320]   It's not a passing thought.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.320]   That's not what this is saying.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.320]   When he's saying think upon these things, he's saying
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.320]   go deep into it.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:22.320]   Because as humans, going deep into things is what we do.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.320]   It's something that we've deemed worthy enough or
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.320]   important enough to think about.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:30.320]   It's to think about something in detail and logical manner.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.320]   Perhaps through the day we're thinking and we find
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.320]   ourselves browsing the topic over the course of time.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.320]   Perhaps our checkbooks will display the things that we're
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.320]   thinking upon.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.320]   Perhaps our Google search histories will tell us the
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:45.320]   things that we're dwelling upon and thinking upon.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.320]   What is it that we've been consuming?
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.320]   What is it that we've been hitting over and over and
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.320]   over again?
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.320]   This is what we do as humans.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.320]   I'm part of this club.
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.320]   It's called the Panera Sip Club.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.320]   You get kind of free drinks.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.320]   It's kind of cool.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:09.320]   You go and then up through July something, I need to
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.320]   remember to cancel my subscription, but like you go
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.320]   and then every two hours you get a free drink.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.320]   And in the beginning I was like this is wonderful and
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.320]   I'm like oh I've got to be careful, you know.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.320]   So now I go and I just get tea, I get hot tea.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.320]   And there are like six different teas and they're all
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.320]   just tea, tea is tea to me, coffee is coffee to me.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:33.320]   And then so what I found is like I found myself like just
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.320]   looking at these teas because like I have to kind of change
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.320]   it up and so I've tried all the different teas.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.320]   And all these teas there, it was very interesting, none of
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.320]   them had strings on them.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.320]   And because they don't have strings on them they give you
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.320]   a tongue and with these tongues you pull it out, it's a
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.320]   little tea bag, you just kind of put it in like scalding
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.320]   like hot water, it's really hot.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:53.320]   And then you just let it sit there.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:57.320]   When I first joined this club, you know, I drank it in the
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.320]   beginning because I like hot tea.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.320]   And then when I drink it I'm like oh that doesn't taste
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.320]   like it's steeped long enough, right.
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:06.320]   And so over time I would figure out like oh I've got to wait
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.320]   this much time before it's steeped enough, it's boiled
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.320]   enough and there were times when I would come back to it
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:15.320]   three hours later and take a sip and go bleh, you know,
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.320]   it's really gross.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.320]   And so you'd look at it, when you look at it steeping I
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:23.320]   think something very interesting is occurring because
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:27.320]   I think I actively saw this two weeks ago, I was just
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.320]   watching it, it was too hot.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.320]   I was just watching my tea bag steep and I'm like that's
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:34.320]   my heart, you know.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:39.320]   That's what my heart is doing, you know, just watching it.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.320]   Because we have a tendency with our hearts to really
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.320]   easily just kind of dip into things, right.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.320]   And whatever we dip into, whatever happens to it,
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:49.320]   nothing much happens.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:54.320]   When we dip it's just, it's gross.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.320]   If you were to be served tea that has been just, you know,
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.320]   it's an inflation and the Panera baristas are like oh
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.320]   we're running out, let me give you some tea and they just
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.320]   give you a dipped tea and they hand this thing over to you
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.320]   and drink it, oh this is not steeped long enough.
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:10.320]   And so we know that when we look at this kind of tea
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.320]   there's something that happens the longer you steep
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:19.320]   inside of it and I think the heart is very much that.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:24.320]   When he's saying think upon, dwell, meditate, ruminate,
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:30.320]   ponder, he's saying actually steep in it.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:35.320]   Because our hearts are very much connected to our thinking.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:39.320]   In fact, when we think of our heart, when we think of what
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:43.320]   it means to give God our heart, it's not that western
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:47.320]   understanding of emotions.
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:52.320]   We might even know that but I don't think we all do that.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:55.320]   There are many of us who might come and say here is my heart
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.320]   and what we're displaying, what we're giving up to God,
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   what we're surrendering are our emotions, how we feel.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.320]   And so when we say God change our hearts, we're asking him
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.320]   to change how I feel.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.320]   But I don't think the Bible talks about the heart just
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.320]   as our feelings.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.320]   In fact, it's threefold.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.320]   It talks about the heart in the Bible as being emotions,
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.320]   your affections and your feelings, but it also talks
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.320]   about your heart as being your will.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.320]   Those are your actions or your behavior.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:23.320]   It's the manifestations.
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.320]   It's what you do.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.320]   That your heart is very much connected to intention.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.320]   And then your mind, and that's what we're talking about here
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.320]   in this word.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.320]   Your thinking, your logic and your rationale.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.320]   And all three of these things are intricately tied
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.320]   to your heart and they together make up your heart
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:43.320]   and you cannot pull them apart from each other.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.320]   They all affect each other.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:52.320]   And so when we give up our hearts to God, it's all of it.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.320]   Now with your emotions, for example, then, how does it
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:57.320]   connect with your will?
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:01.320]   Well, it connects with your will very clearly because when
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:05.320]   you're depressed, like what your behavior looks like
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:08.320]   and how you act, the things you do, the decisions you make,
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:13.320]   all those things become very much affected, don't they?
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:17.320]   Depression will definitely affect your actions.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.320]   If you're in fear, it's going to cause you to act rashly
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.320]   or cautiously maybe.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.320]   If you're happy, it's going to cause you to act generously.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.320]   When you're sad, maybe selfishly.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.320]   So you begin to base so much of your will and intention
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.320]   on how you feel.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.320]   Your emotions, though, also affect your thinking.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.320]   It's not difficult to see this.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.320]   Just talk to any lovesick person when they've been--
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:43.320]   their hearts are so emotional, so filled with feeling
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.320]   that they begin to talk nonsense, right?
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.320]   And then it affects the way they live and it affects
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.320]   the way they think.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.320]   The love of their life started dating someone else
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.320]   and gets married to someone else.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.320]   And just look at that person and see how it affects
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.320]   their thinking.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.320]   "I will never get married.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.320]   I will never be happy ever again in my life.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:07.320]   I am going to die alone and a loser."
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.320]   And you're like sitting there like, "What are you talking
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.320]   about right now?"
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.320]   You see, like, your affections begin to change
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.320]   your thinking.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.320]   All this to say, your thinking--because that's what
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.320]   we're talking about today, the thinking--the thinking
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.320]   actually affects your will.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.320]   And the thinking actually affects your emotions
[00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:30.320]   because this all has to do with the control center
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.320]   of the human being, the heart.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.320]   In Philippians chapter 4, verse 8, let's look at it again.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.320]   "Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is noble,
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.320]   whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely,
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:39.320]   whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:44.320]   and if anything worthy of praise, dwell, think, meditate,
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:51.320]   ruminate upon the things that were just written above."
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:55.320]   This is a command.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.320]   And this necessitates a couple of things because,
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:00.320]   number one, if it's a command, it's a command.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.320]   It's a command from God.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.320]   He's telling you to do this.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:07.320]   It's not something where he says, "Think about it,"
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.320]   and then go like, "Okay, like, come back to me when you want
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:10.320]   to obey or not."
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.320]   He's saying, "Obey this."
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.320]   It is an expectation upon us.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:19.320]   We must dwell on these things.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:23.320]   But also, a second thing that comes up with this is that
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:24.320]   we're given a choice.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.320]   I think that's very clear, too.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:35.320]   We're given this choice there to obey or to disobey.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.320]   The command is here because of the threat that there is
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.320]   to the human mind.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:43.320]   In 2 Corinthians 4, it says, "In whose case the God of this
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.320]   world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:49.320]   might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ,
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.320]   who is the image of God."
[00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.320]   Now, he could have easily have said, the Apostle Paul here,
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:59.320]   "In whose case the God of this world has blinded the eyes
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.320]   or the heart."
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.320]   Or he could have just said, "He's blinded them."
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:07.320]   But he specifically says he's blinded the minds of the
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.320]   unbelieving.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.320]   Why?
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:12.320]   So that they might not see the light of the gospel.
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.320]   And then he says something very interesting,
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.320]   "Who is the image of God."
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.320]   So what that means is there's something intricately connected
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:23.320]   with our thinking and with our sight, right?
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:28.320]   With our thinking, with what we perceive to be reality.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:31.320]   It's not disconnected.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.320]   And so when we fill our thoughts with something,
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.320]   will it not affect us?
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.320]   Of course it will.
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.320]   That's why our affections are changed.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.320]   That's why sometimes we know something is right or wrong,
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:46.320]   and we will continue to do maybe what is wrong,
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.320]   even though we know in our thought process that this is
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.320]   wrong.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:55.320]   It affects us.
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:57.320]   Here it's saying that Satan is blinding the minds of the
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.320]   unbelieving people so that they wouldn't see the light of the
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.320]   gospel.
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.320]   And they have no choice in the matter.
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.320]   They're blind.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:07.320]   In Psalm 115 verse 4, see what happens to the unbelieving
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.320]   people.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.320]   "Their idols are silver and gold,
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.320]   the work of man's hands.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.320]   They have mouths, but they cannot speak.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.320]   They have eyes, but they cannot see.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.320]   They have ears, but they cannot hear.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.320]   They have noses, but they cannot smell.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.320]   They have hands, but they cannot feel.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.320]   They have feet, but they cannot walk.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.320]   They cannot make a sound with their throat.
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.320]   Those who make them will become like them."
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.320]   I wanted to highlight that.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.320]   "Those who make these idols will become like them,
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.320]   everyone who trusts in them."
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.320]   I like to think about this as like the unbelieving way of
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.320]   sanctification.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.320]   There's like the believer's way of sanctification where we're
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.320]   going to look at that in just a moment where we're sanctified
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.320]   into the image of Christ.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:44.320]   But with the unbelieving people,
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.320]   those who make them will become like them.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:52.320]   Now, let me turn our attentions here to the believer because the
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.320]   believer can see, right?
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:58.320]   We have seen the light of the gospel.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.320]   We have seen the glory of Christ.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.320]   We have seen all these things, and this is our reality.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.320]   And so 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse 16,
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:09.320]   "Therefore," it says, "we do not lose heart,
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.320]   but though our outer man is decaying,
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.320]   yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:16.320]   For momentary light affliction is producing for us an eternal
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:20.320]   weight of glory far beyond all comparison while we look not at
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:24.320]   the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:25.320]   For the things which are seen are temporal,
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:28.320]   but the things which are not seen are eternal."
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:35.320]   And verse 18, we come across a choice because this is talking
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.320]   to the believer.
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:42.320]   And he's saying we look not at the things which are seen.
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:45.320]   That is actually our reality.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:52.320]   We are people of light, and we're thinking but at the things
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:55.320]   which are not seen, right, the eternal things.
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:58.320]   So right before this, in 2 Corinthians chapter 3,
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.320]   he says, "But we all with unveiled face,
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.320]   beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord,
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.320]   are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory,
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.320]   justice from the Lord, the Spirit."
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:13.320]   Now, I bring up all this because for the believer,
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:20.320]   there is an intentional choice we can make to behold and to see
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:25.320]   and to think, to ruminate upon and to dwell on.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:28.320]   And there's something about the clearer sight that we have of
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:33.320]   God that causes us to become more like him.
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:35.320]   Now, my question to you is this.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.320]   What happens when the believer, not the unbeliever,
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:45.320]   when the believer chooses to dwell upon the worldly things?
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.320]   What's going to happen?
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:53.320]   Well, for the unbeliever, it says, "They become like them."
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:57.320]   What about the believer?
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:00.320]   Something to think about there.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:04.320]   And so what we're called to hear with this idea of the mind is
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.320]   to--when we say we want to give God our whole hearts,
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:10.320]   we need to give him everything we're thinking,
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:15.320]   everything we've been thinking, every thought is his.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:19.320]   And this is powerful because I think what many times what we
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.320]   try to do is give him our feelings.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.320]   We say, "Here it is.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:24.320]   Change it."
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.320]   And we have our hands up.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.320]   I say, "I surrender."
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:30.320]   But how can God take a portion of your heart?
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:33.320]   He can only take all of it, right?
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:36.320]   He only demands all of it, right?
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:39.320]   We cannot say, "Change this," but I get to think upon the things
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.320]   I want to think upon.
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.320]   "Change me, despite me."
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:46.320]   Is that how sanctification works?
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:49.320]   No, it works in obedience to what's happening.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:52.320]   And the Scriptures tell us how that looks.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.320]   That's why in Matthew 22, verse 37, it says,
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.320]   "You shall love the Lord your God."
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.320]   He could have stopped there.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:01.320]   Actually, how sad a thing it is that he can't stop there.
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.320]   He has to describe what it is to love.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:07.320]   This should be a given to us, but he describes it with all your
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:10.320]   heart, and he describes it some more with all your soul,
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:14.320]   and with all your mind.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.320]   We can just look at this and be like, "Hey,
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.320]   let's wipe this all together and just be like he just wants all
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.320]   of us."
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.320]   True, but let's take this time to think about it.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:25.320]   It's all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:30.320]   Let's consider the mind because it's part of your heart.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:36.320]   And so to dwell is a command to us to think in a different way
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:38.320]   because it affects our hearts.
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:40.320]   And it's mentioned quite frequently in Scripture for us
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:41.320]   to look at it.
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.320]   Colossians chapter 3, verse 1, "Therefore,
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:44.320]   if you have been raised up with Christ,
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:46.320]   keep seeking the things above where Christ is,
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.320]   seated at the right hand of God.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:52.320]   Set your," not heart, but set your mind on the things above,
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.320]   not on the things that are on earth.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.320]   Romans 8, 5, "For those who are according to the flesh,
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.320]   set their minds on the things of the flesh.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.320]   But those who are according to the things of the spirit,
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.320]   for the mind set on the flesh is death,
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.320]   but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:08.320]   Because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God,
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.320]   for it does not subject itself to the law of God,
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.320]   for it is not even able to do so.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:17.320]   And those who are in the flesh cannot please God."
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.320]   Romans 12, 2, "And do not be conformed to this world,
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:22.320]   but be transformed by the renewing of your," again,
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.320]   it's your mind, "so that you may prove what is the will of God,
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.320]   that which is good and acceptable and perfect."
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.320]   Even taking a moment to look at this,
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.320]   that "so that" will show you that you cannot discern
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:35.320]   what is good and acceptable and perfect
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:40.320]   unless your mind is being renewed.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.320]   2 Corinthians 10, 3, "For though we walk in the flesh,
[00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:44.320]   we do not war according to the flesh.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.320]   For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh,
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:49.320]   but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.320]   We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:53.320]   raised up against the knowledge of God,
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:56.320]   and we are taking every thought captive
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.320]   to the obedience of Christ.
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.320]   And we are ready to punish all disobedience
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:01.320]   whenever your obedience is complete."
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.320]   He's talking about speculations, he's talking about knowledge,
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:10.320]   he's talking about taking every thought captive.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:12.320]   There's a lot that has to do with this.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.320]   And there are a lot of like, by the way,
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.320]   this isn't like a word study where all of these words
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:19.320]   are the same words, but these words are very intricately
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:23.320]   coming together to show us the importance of our minds.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:28.320]   So what have you been thinking on?
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:31.320]   What have you been dwelling upon?
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:34.320]   What's been circulating?
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:41.320]   Have Christian godly thoughts been things we dip into
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.320]   like this?
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:48.320]   I'm going to list out some things that maybe,
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.320]   I tried to get a wide array here,
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:53.320]   maybe it's music.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:56.320]   Music has been so, especially with the invention
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:59.320]   of the smartphone and wireless capabilities
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:01.320]   with our earbuds.
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:02.320]   It's pretty crazy.
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.320]   You can now like put in your earbuds and be listening
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.320]   to music or even podcasts or whatever, right?
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.320]   These could be good things.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.320]   You're listening to it and then you get in the car
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:10.320]   and it automatically sometimes connects to your car.
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.320]   Seamless, seamless transition.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:13.320]   You just keep listening.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:19.320]   And it's almost hard nowadays to get the quiet, right?
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:22.320]   Fashion.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.320]   We could be distracted and thinking upon fashion.
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:28.320]   This is not something I very much, for me,
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:30.320]   it's like maybe more like gadgetry.
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.320]   What kind of lump these things all together?
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:33.320]   We go into these things and we go on websites
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:36.320]   and we just start scrolling and looking and researching.
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:40.320]   Man, many of us know the lyrics to songs,
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:44.320]   50 of them, or the capabilities of these gadgets
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:49.320]   or the latest trends so much more in a deeper way
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:53.320]   than we know scripture, right?
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:54.320]   Right?
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:58.320]   It's kind of sad, but there is a lot of that
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.320]   where we're able to kind of push out these things
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:01.320]   really quickly.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:02.320]   Why?
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:05.320]   Because we've been dwelling on those things.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.320]   Have we been dwelling on the things of God
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:08.320]   like we dwell on these things?
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:10.320]   I'm just pushing these things out, okay?
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.320]   By the way, this isn't like guilt trip time.
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.320]   This is like, hey, let's just really think about
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:16.320]   what we've been thinking about.
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:19.320]   Movies, getting lost in these imaginary worlds.
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:21.320]   I know there are some movies that when you're in it,
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.320]   when you come out of it, you're like dazed
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.320]   because you feel like you've been in a different world
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:26.320]   for three hours.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.320]   But there's a lot of this I thought was like so interesting.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:31.320]   When my wife and I were watching like one of,
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.320]   I think it was the latest Spider-Man movie,
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:37.320]   somebody told us we needed to know,
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.320]   or we read it somewhere, something,
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:41.320]   we needed to know all the other 50 Spider-Man movies
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:42.320]   that were out there.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.320]   And so we're like, how are we supposed to do that?
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:46.320]   And then I remember looking up one of the recap things,
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:49.320]   but they were like, they would go for like ever.
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:51.320]   You know where you scroll and then that little bar thing
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.320]   goes only a little?
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:54.320]   Like, oh my gosh, this thing's really long.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.320]   And so somebody sent us a YouTube video,
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:59.320]   and the YouTube video of recaps of all the other movies
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:01.320]   was like an hour and a half long.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:03.320]   What is this?
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:07.320]   And it's just, we can get lost in these worlds even.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:12.320]   Shows, dramas, many people are into K-dramas,
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:15.320]   and it sucks you in.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:20.320]   You weep like no tomorrow over some scene.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:22.320]   You look at these things, and when it ends,
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.320]   you feel like your friends have died.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.320]   They're gone.
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.320]   Like, we're so deep into these things
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:28.320]   because we're dwelling.
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:30.320]   We're ruminating, we're meditating.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.320]   We've allowed our hearts to steep in it.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.320]   I'm not saying it's wrong to do these things.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.320]   I'm just saying, hey, can we travel together here
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:40.320]   and wonder what it is that we've been dwelling upon?
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:41.320]   Video games.
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:44.320]   Is this too, like, childish to talk about video games here?
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:48.320]   I don't think so, because video games goes up to old ages now.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.320]   Video games.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.320]   So many things.
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:53.320]   As a youth pastor, I remember just being like,
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.320]   what is happening, you know?
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:57.320]   Because they're like, they're in a world,
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:59.320]   I know I'm like, I'm still a young guy,
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.320]   but like so quickly everything was changing.
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:03.320]   I remember one of the girls, my former youth students,
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:05.320]   was like talking about a cat game
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.320]   where there's like a living room,
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.320]   and you make this living room look really pretty,
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.320]   and then cats come, and they hang out,
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:12.320]   and then they leave.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:14.320]   And she said like, yeah, yeah, I have a problem, Pastor Nate,
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:16.320]   because I bought something.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.320]   I'm like, what do you mean you bought something?
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:19.320]   She said, I bought this couch.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.320]   I'm like, what do you mean you bought a couch?
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.320]   It's a video game.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.320]   She's like, yeah.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.320]   You spent real money to buy a couch on this game?
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:28.320]   She's like, yeah, but look at it, though, you know?
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.320]   And she was like, I'm thinking about it too much.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:31.320]   A few weeks later, she came up,
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:33.320]   and she was like, I deleted the whole thing.
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.320]   And I was like, why?
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:36.320]   She was like, oh, I was thinking too much about it.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:38.320]   I'm like, oh, my gosh.
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.320]   We think so much about these things.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.320]   I'm right there.
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.320]   I'm right there with it, because there was a time,
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.320]   like I was really into like fantasy football
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:47.320]   and fantasy basketball and things like that.
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.320]   I'd be constantly thinking about it,
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:53.320]   constantly look up all the stats, and it sucks you in.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:56.320]   Fine line, isn't it, between the dwelling?
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:59.320]   Leisure, what about travel and vacation?
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:02.320]   For those close enough to taste it, what about retirement?
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:05.320]   What it might be like?
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:07.320]   Curating the best experiences that we can think of,
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:11.320]   devoting hours and hours, putting up, okay, I'm going here.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:12.320]   Rex, please.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.320]   And then we spend much time just looking
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:18.320]   at all the good places to eat, all the ways that we can succumb
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:20.320]   to every fleshly pleasure, you know?
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.320]   Like we're like just constantly thinking,
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:25.320]   what are the best things that we can get out of this world?
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:28.320]   I'm not saying this is wrong, right?
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:30.320]   But we're all in this.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:32.320]   We're like goldfish in this water, right?
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:36.320]   This is all around us, devoting hours and hours,
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:40.320]   fantasizing, weeks after weeks, months after months,
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:42.320]   years after years.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:44.320]   That's my place I want to go to before I die.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.320]   For me, it's New Zealand.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:49.320]   That's where I want to go, ruminating, meditating,
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:53.320]   and dwelling, even more so than heaven.
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.320]   You know, like there's a lot that we have to think about here.
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:59.320]   In Hebrews 12, verse 1, it says, "Since we have, therefore,
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:01.320]   so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us."
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:04.320]   And let me take a moment here to remind us of what came before
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:07.320]   in Hebrews 11.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.320]   That he's saying, think about these cloud of witnesses
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:11.320]   of faith, right?
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:14.320]   And he reminds us of what they walked and what they went
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:17.320]   through and how that ended in their lives.
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:23.320]   They died for their faith.
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:26.320]   Okay, and so we take this back into our lives,
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:29.320]   and we're looking at this Hebrews 12, verse 1.
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:31.320]   "We have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us who have
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:34.320]   such great things."
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:37.320]   And then he says, "Let us also lay aside every encumbrance."
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:42.320]   And then we think, like, what are our encumbrances?
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:46.320]   How sad.
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:51.320]   How sad that it's sports and leisure and vacations.
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:52.320]   And you know what I'm saying?
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:54.320]   Do you guys feel what I'm saying?
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:58.320]   That here he's saying we must lay aside every encumbrance and
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:02.320]   the sin, so both things, things that might distract us,
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:06.320]   which so easily entangles us.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:08.320]   In 2 Timothy 2, verse 4, "No soldier in active service
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:10.320]   entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life,
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:13.320]   so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier."
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.320]   Now, be careful here.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:17.320]   He's not saying it's wrong to entangle yourself in the affairs
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:18.320]   of everyday life.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:22.320]   He's saying it's wrong for the soldier, right?
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:25.320]   It's not wrong to take a nap, but it is if you're in the midst
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:29.320]   of war and you're the watchtower guy, right?
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:31.320]   It's being aware of reality.
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:34.320]   It's not wrong to partake in the things of this world,
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:36.320]   but we can't live in that, right?
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.320]   Why?
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:39.320]   Because we're saying a war is raging around us.
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:40.320]   We just completed 1 Peter.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:44.320]   We are saying there's a lion here that has been uncaged,
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.320]   and he is prowling.
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.320]   How are we on our phones?
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:52.320]   We're staring at this prowling lion, aren't we?
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:54.320]   You don't need to tell me twice.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:59:01.320]   I'm looking because this is our reality.
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.320]   Like, I don't think this is a place where he's telling us to
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:05.320]   dwell on these good things.
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:08.320]   He is not sitting there telling us on all the bad things not to
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:12.320]   dwell on, right?
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:16.320]   We have to, like, pull this all out because we have to think
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:19.320]   about this because of how it's affecting us.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:23.320]   How much of us has gone into dwelling upon these worldly
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:26.320]   things that many of them aren't in themselves, bad or evil,
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:30.320]   but we can very clearly say that we have gotten caught up in the
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:33.320]   affairs of everyday life, that we are getting tripped up by
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:36.320]   the encumbrances that are near.
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:39.320]   And so the command to us to dwell on the good things is a
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:45.320]   command also negatively to say, "Stop dwelling on those things."
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:49.320]   They're a necessary two sides of the coin thing.
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:54.320]   What about security things?
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:56.320]   Politics?
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:59.320]   It's like, it's overused now, but CNN or Fox, right?
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.320]   But I think nowadays it's like, "Oh, I'm not going to get caught
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.320]   this way or that way.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.320]   I'm going to be more balanced."
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.320]   And we found our independent news sources.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:07.320]   Same thing, though.
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.320]   Find yourself dwelling, meditating on all these
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:14.320]   independent sources, constantly perusing and feeling
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.320]   the need to stay up to date with everything that's happening
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.320]   in this world.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:19.320]   The thought of, "Oh, what about like children,
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.320]   the security of our children that we're getting caught up
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:25.320]   dwelling on their futures and their success, their safety,
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.320]   because this world is going down the drain."
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.320]   Relationships, what about are we dwelling on friendships,
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.320]   investing in the realm of pleasing man over God?
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.320]   What about romantic relationships,
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:38.320]   dwelling so much on certain individuals or dwelling on the
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.320]   need to date or to get engaged or get married?
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.320]   What about personal reputation?
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:46.320]   Also in the Christian sense, we can seek security in establishing
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.320]   something in front of others, establishing relationships amongst
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.320]   peers or the church.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:54.320]   What about our careers, so invested in moving up the ladder,
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:57.320]   growing not in godly ambition in career,
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.320]   but clearly in fleshly ambition in career,
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.320]   letting it bleed into the way we feel about ourselves and how we
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.320]   present to others.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.320]   Have we been dwelling in these things?
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.320]   What about our money?
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.320]   Have we been dwelling in money?
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.320]   Yeah, Bitcoin and Ethereum, you've been like, "Oh."
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.320]   Like, "No, don't talk about that today.
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.320]   I'll bring it out."
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.320]   You're in big trouble, right?
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.320]   We've got to just ride it out.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.320]   We've just got to ride it out.
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.320]   That's your hope.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.320]   You've just got to hope.
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.320]   You've just got to ride it out.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.320]   What a lame hope.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.320]   Don't look at your 401(k).
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.320]   But is that what we've been dwelling on?
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:31.320]   We're looking at it and we're stressed about these things.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:35.320]   1 John 2, verse 15, he says, "Do not love the world,
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:37.320]   nor the things in the world."
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.320]   Now, if we were commanded in Matthew 22,
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.320]   where all the commandments are, "Love the Lord your God with all
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.320]   your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind."
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:48.320]   When he says, "Do not love the world," it means do not love the
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.320]   world with all your heart, with all your soul,
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.320]   and with all your mind as well.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:55.320]   If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.320]   And he's saying then that there is no arbitrary place.
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:01.320]   There is no neutral ground that if you do not love God and the
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.320]   things of God, then you are loving the world and the things
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.320]   of the world.
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.320]   If you are not dwelling on God and the things of God,
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.320]   then you are dwelling on the things of the world and the
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.320]   things that it has to offer.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.320]   He says in verse 16, "For all that is in the world,
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.320]   the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:16.320]   pride of life, is not from the Father,
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.320]   but is from the world.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.320]   The world is passing away, and also its lusts.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.320]   But the one who does the will of God lives forever."
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.320]   What have you been dwelling on?
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:30.320]   Have you been dwelling on how bad the world is?
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:33.320]   Chiming in with the chorus that this world is going down the
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.320]   drain, how everything is wrong.
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.320]   Hypocritical judgment just going out.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.320]   Able to point out how wrong everyone else is.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.320]   To grab the people that we like to grab and say, boom,
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.320]   look at what he said.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.320]   Let's say how wrong he is.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.320]   And we continue pounding that drum.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.320]   And we continue bringing things in,
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:54.320]   into our world and building these things up where we're
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:57.320]   saturating ourselves and we're steeping in that.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:03.320]   Is that what you want to steep on?
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:06.320]   Perhaps we've grown angry and constantly frustrated that there
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.320]   is no place of Christian joy that marks us.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:12.320]   When people look at us, they go, "That guy is always just not
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.320]   happy."
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:18.320]   Mouth opens, complaining comes out.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.320]   Remember, this is the thought.
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.320]   What about if you're able to keep your mouth shut?
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:30.320]   What would your heart speak?
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:33.320]   Ultimately, it's only in a place of humility,
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.320]   right, where you begin to see where you've been dwelling on
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.320]   the right things and not the wrong things.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:41.320]   You could say all the right things,
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.320]   but if you're coming from the wrong place,
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.320]   the whole thing is wrong.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.320]   We'll address that a little bit more, too.
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.320]   What have you been dwelling on?
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.320]   Have you been dwelling on sexually immoral things?
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:55.320]   Now we can get into the realm of sinful stuff.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.320]   What do you think is going to happen when you're steeping in
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:01.320]   pornography?
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:04.320]   What do you think is going to happen when you're constantly
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.320]   dwelling on things and you're having to justify it's okay to
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:09.320]   watch this show despite the questionable morals,
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:12.320]   despite the questionable scenes, and just look and be like,
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.320]   "Yeah, but it's okay."
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:18.320]   What do you think is going to happen to your heart when it's
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.320]   all connected?
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:24.320]   You cannot pull those things apart.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:28.320]   So many things.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:30.320]   Now here's the cool thing about today's passage.
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:34.320]   It doesn't say anything about what I just said, right?
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.320]   All the things we might have been steeping on.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:39.320]   The cool thing about today's passage is not just pounding
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.320]   about everything that we're doing wrong.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:45.320]   It's saying, it's reminding, it's commanding us to look at that
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.320]   which is beautiful.
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.320]   This is important.
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:52.320]   So when we look at all the wrong things,
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.320]   we're not just looking at the wrong things.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.320]   We're looking at the wrong things.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.320]   We're looking at the wrong things.
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.320]   We're not just looking at the wrong things.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.320]   We're looking at the wrong things.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.320]   We're looking at the wrong things.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.320]   We're looking at the wrong things.
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.320]   We're looking at the wrong things.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.320]   We're looking at the wrong things.
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.320]   We're looking at the wrong things.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.320]   We're looking at the wrong things.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:16.320]   We're looking at the wrong things.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.320]   We're looking at the wrong things.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:20.320]   We're looking at the wrong things.
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.320]   We're dwelling on something.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.320]   I hope we're in agreement with that.
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.320]   We're all dwelling on something.
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.320]   Now he's telling us what to dwell on.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.320]   And here's the list.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.320]   And whenever he gives a list, remember that he is giving special
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.320]   attention to each thing on the list.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.320]   It's not for us to say like good things, godly things,
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.320]   let's just dwell on that.
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.320]   That's the command to us.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.320]   No.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.320]   If we're supposed to think and ruminate and meditate and saturate
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:46.320]   and seep and steep and dwell on these things,
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.320]   then we have need to engage our minds and to look at each of these words.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.320]   I've become very American.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.320]   Like couch potato minds when it comes to the things of God's word.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.320]   I know that because when I came back to this passage and I was looking at each word again,
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.320]   I had to exercise my mind again because I had forgotten.
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.320]   So we have to go into each one of these.
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:00.320]   True, that's the first one.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.320]   True.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:04.320]   That means pertaining to being real and not imaginary.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.320]   That sounds so simple.
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.320]   Pertaining to being real and not imaginary.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.320]   There have been people I've counseled who are like,
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.320]   "Oh, like I'm not going to do that.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.320]   I'm not going to do that."
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.320]   And I've been like, "No, you're not going to do that."
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.320]   And there have been people I've counseled who are like,
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.320]   "Well, like how do I know God loves me?"
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.320]   Because it says God loves you.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.320]   Right?
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:26.320]   It's just, there are certain things about faith.
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.320]   It's like, "But how do I want God?"
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.320]   But it's just like, "Well, do you want Him?"
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.320]   There are these things about faith.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.320]   It's like, "Well, do you believe it?"
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.320]   You know, the faith is an amazing thing
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.320]   because it's that perfect intersection
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.320]   between just believing
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.320]   and then everything just becoming a reality
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.320]   as a result of that.
[01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.320]   Right?
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.320]   Because there's a surrender to that thought.
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.320]   So when we're saying that,
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:52.320]   when Paul is saying that we must dwell on true things,
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.320]   we have to ask ourselves what is true?
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:56.320]   What is real?
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.320]   What is not imaginary?
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.320]   There's a report done,
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.320]   and it was, whatever.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.320]   I don't care about the results.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.320]   You know, you can like make this the results
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.320]   of any survey, however you want.
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.320]   But they were polling a poll
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.320]   and they were saying,
[01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.320]   "What are the things that you're worried about?"
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.320]   Like you have deep anxiety over it,
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:18.320]   and they would write it in, turn it in.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.320]   And then they arbitrarily figured out
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.320]   like, "Oh, only 8% of those people
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.320]   had anxieties that were actually of concern."
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.320]   The other 92% was not really a concern.
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.320]   And that was an arbitrary thing,
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.320]   but it's still an interesting thing
[01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.320]   because when we were to ask ourselves
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.320]   the question, the things that we're anxious about,
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.320]   how much of that pertains to what we believe
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.320]   to be truth and reality versus lies, right?
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.320]   And so, you know,
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.320]   the truth is lies, right?
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.320]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.320]   No?
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.320]   I got some blank eyes, so.
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:52.320]   Because when we steep ourselves
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.320]   in the truths of God,
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.320]   like our very reality changes, doesn't it?
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:00.320]   Right?
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.320]   When we're looking at the things of God
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.320]   and we're thinking about the things of God,
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.320]   I'm not saying that
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.320]   we can come doctrinally to the correct conclusions,
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.320]   but when we're steeping in it,
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.320]   something is different.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.320]   My home church, where I grew up in,
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.320]   it was a lot more elderly people,
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.320]   so I was at the hospital every month
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:20.320]   at many, many deathbed visits.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:22.320]   And it was incredibly sobering to me.
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:24.320]   Because one of the interesting things is,
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.320]   you know that thing where we say,
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.320]   if somebody is going through a difficult time,
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:30.320]   don't say, "Trust God."
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:32.320]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:34.320]   Because it might be kind of insensitive,
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:36.320]   and that's true. We have to be careful, right?
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:38.320]   But that's the truth, though.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:40.320]   And so somewhere in the midst of that conversation,
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:42.320]   or one day, if that person refuses
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:44.320]   to trust God, we have to be able to say,
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.320]   "Trust in the Lord with all your heart. Do not lean on your own understanding.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:48.320]   In all your ways, acknowledge Him,
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.320]   and He will keep your path straight."
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.320]   Because that's the conclusion that we believe in.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:54.320]   That's the truth, right?
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.320]   But what was really sobering to me was,
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.320]   when I'd go to these deathbeds of some of these individuals
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:00.320]   who have been walking with Christ for decades,
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.320]   I would go, and you know what happened?
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.320]   In a place where I should be telling them,
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:06.320]   "Trust God," they were looking at me,
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:08.320]   "Young man," I said, "Trust God."
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.320]   These people have been
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.320]   steeping in this truth.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:16.320]   It has become their reality.
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:20.320]   This is their truth,
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.320]   and they're not just saying it because it's a doctrine to them.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:24.320]   They're saying it because it is the truth.
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:28.320]   It's real, and they've been ruminating on it.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:30.320]   And like a teabag,
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:32.320]   they've been steeping in it over and over
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.320]   and over and over again.
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:36.320]   When you're a kid,
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:38.320]   it could be a cut finger that makes your whole life
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:40.320]   turn around. Later on in life, it could be
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:42.320]   cancer.
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:44.320]   But they've grown in this and steeping in
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:46.320]   the truth. Think about the
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:48.320]   truth of God. What would happen to us
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:50.320]   if we stopped believing in the lies of the enemy
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:52.320]   and the lies that the world is trying to say?
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:54.320]   What would happen to us?
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.320]   When the world says, "You must buy this thing,"
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:58.320]   we know in here,
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.320]   "No, I don't. Uh-uh-uh.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.320]   Stop trying to trick me.
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.320]   I don't need that."
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:06.320]   And then we keep clicking on it.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:10.320]   We're resolved for one month,
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:12.320]   but in three months, there's our car, sparkly,
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.320]   right in the front
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.320]   of our house.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.320]   We know,
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:20.320]   but what do we dwell
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.320]   on? We might know, and then we
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.320]   start dwelling on those things, and look at what
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.320]   happens.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.320]   We must dwell on these things. What's going to happen
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.320]   when you dwell on these truths?
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.320]   If God is for us, then who can be against us?
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.320]   How will that actually paint our reality?
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.320]   How will that change our hearts?
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.320]   How would it change our hearts if we
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.320]   believe in this truth, for to us
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.320]   to live is Christ and to die is gain?
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.320]   If we were to
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.320]   ruminate in the truth, the world is passing away
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:48.320]   and all that is in it. Unbelievers are
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.320]   today perishing.
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.320]   We're dwelling and steeping in
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.320]   that truth.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.320]   How will our hearts change?
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.320]   How will our wills and our motives
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.320]   and our intentions and our behavior and our thoughts
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.320]   and our affections, how would we change as people?
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.320]   Now, this is a sanctification.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:10.320]   What about what is
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.320]   honorable?
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.320]   What is honorable?
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.320]   See, we have this
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.320]   thought of like, hey, your feelings
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.320]   do not dictate the truth.
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:22.320]   The Word of God, the truth is
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.320]   the truth. God tells you what is true.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.320]   Right?
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.320]   When we look at these things
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.320]   and we move into
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.320]   what is honorable, this idea
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.320]   of what is pertaining to appropriate
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.320]   or good or dignified
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.320]   or respectable things.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.320]   Now we go into
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.320]   a realm of truth that shows you actually
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:44.320]   what is good.
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.320]   Things that are worthy of respect or of good
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.320]   character. Some translations say noble
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.320]   things, elevated things. I like the way
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.320]   Steve Lawson, a word he uses, he says
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.320]   lofty things. I love that word.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.320]   High things, majestic things.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:00.320]   So let's take a moment, look the other way.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.320]   He's saying not the trashy
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:04.320]   things of the world, not the mundane things,
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.320]   the temporal things of the world, not the trivial
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.320]   things. He's saying do not dwell
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.320]   upon the things that are just kind of passing away.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.320]   He is saying look
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.320]   and dwell and think about
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.320]   the eternal things.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.320]   The lofty things. Because if we
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:20.320]   believe it in here and we're just kind of thinking about it,
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:22.320]   yeah I agree with that, we're doing the Christian
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.320]   head nod and we're not dwelling on
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.320]   it, what do we think is going to come about as a
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.320]   result?
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:32.320]   Every once in a while dipping into that water.
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.320]   What is
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.320]   honorable? Think of what you're reading,
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.320]   partaking in when no
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.320]   one else is looking. What you watch
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:42.320]   on TikTok, articles you're clicking
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.320]   into, what images you linger on, what
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:46.320]   things that you fantasize about.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.320]   Are these things
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:50.320]   honorable things?
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.320]   See he's not telling you what not to look at,
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.320]   he's telling you what to look at.
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.320]   If we're coming and saying like well I'm allowed
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.320]   to, but what he's saying
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.320]   is well not like what I'm not
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:02.320]   allowed to do, he's saying like look at
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.320]   the things that are good
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.320]   and dwell on those
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.320]   things. Because when you dwell on those things
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.320]   these things fade. That's
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.320]   the point.
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:16.320]   We're called not
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.320]   dishonorable things control our thoughts.
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.320]   When we
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.320]   steep on the honorable our hearts change,
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.320]   our reactions change and it shows us
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.320]   the moments of reaction where we've been
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.320]   steeping. Now those moments of reactions
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.320]   are many. One of them I think
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.320]   is familiar with a lot of us like the freeway.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.320]   You go on the freeway and then
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.320]   like as soon as someone cuts you off
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.320]   it shows you how you've been walking with the Lord.
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:40.320]   I'm very convinced of this.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.320]   Not when you're with your
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.320]   family or with somebody else in the car, but when
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.320]   you're by yourself.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.320]   That when you're
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.320]   ruminating and mulling and steeping on
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.320]   the things that are lofty and honorable
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.320]   and good, respectable, noble
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.320]   just these things that are
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.320]   of God. Someone cuts off
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.320]   what's going to come out.
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:02.320]   That shows you where your heart
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.320]   has been steeping.
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.320]   Do not let yourself be fooled into
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:08.320]   thinking that you can believe yourself to be a
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.320]   double-minded person. That
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.320]   with a group of people you can say all these lofty
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:14.320]   things about God and then in these
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:16.320]   situations, in these places of the
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.320]   hidden heart, there aren't honorable
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.320]   things going on.
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:22.320]   It's not right.
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:24.320]   You cannot give that kind of heart to God.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:26.320]   He will not accept it.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.320]   What is right, the ESV
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.320]   says what is just. The things that
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.320]   are right, that which are morally
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.320]   right, the holy things
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.320]   that conform to God's commands.
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.320]   So
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.320]   often I think we are righteous upholders of God's
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:42.320]   law. Hey, God
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:44.320]   doesn't need us to like defend
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.320]   who He is.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.320]   We are just called to show people
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.320]   who God is by our lives
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.320]   and through the word.
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:54.320]   He does not need defending.
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:58.320]   On right things, to think
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.320]   upon right things, we must not
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.320]   laugh along with jokes against God
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.320]   to root along with storylines
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.320]   of immorality, to partake in the
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.320]   things, to dwell upon the things and
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.320]   say like, it's my Christian liberty.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:14.320]   Because here He's saying, dwell.
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:16.320]   It's a present continuous,
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.320]   continuously, every day,
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.320]   steeping, ruminating, mulling on
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.320]   the right things of God.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:26.320]   Just a word.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.320]   My kids, I'm going to stop using names
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.320]   because I realize I should stop using my kids' names.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.320]   There's three of them so you could guess.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.320]   There's one kid who comes
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.320]   and this person
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.320]   comes and tattles
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.320]   and says, "Oh, this other person
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.320]   in my home has done this."
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:46.320]   You know, I see this
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.320]   as this individual.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:50.320]   This is kind of hard.
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.320]   I have two girls so I'll just say she.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.320]   Oh, okay, well.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.320]   That's that. All right.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:00.320]   Okay, so when she's
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:02.320]   like, "Oh, this person did this."
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.320]   It's actually a good thing that she told me
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.320]   this because that thing was
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:08.320]   dangerous or wrong or something like that.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.320]   I would have to go and address this.
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:12.320]   But the problem is this, and if you're a parent
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:14.320]   you might be familiar with this. When this person comes
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.320]   like, "This person did this."
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.320]   It's like the attitude in which
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.320]   she comes is like, it's really
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.320]   bad. So ugly.
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:26.320]   There are times when they act like that.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.320]   I actually audibly just want to go
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.320]   like, "Ugh."
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:34.320]   She's saying the right things.
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.320]   She did the right thing to tell me.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.320]   But she's like, "He did this."
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:42.320]   Oh, okay.
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:46.320]   So Addy tattles on Hudson a lot.
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:50.320]   It's like everyday right now.
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.320]   Okay. Oh, well.
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:56.320]   All right.
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.320]   But you see what I'm saying, right?
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.320]   When we're dwelling on right things,
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.320]   we can just say the right things,
[01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.320]   we can do the right things,
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.320]   and all this kind of stuff, but that's not actually
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:08.320]   a person who has been
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.320]   steeping their heart in right things.
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:12.320]   It looks so different.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.320]   The love, the kindness,
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.320]   the grace, and even the
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:18.320]   rebuke and the exhortations, and the
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.320]   wrath looks very different.
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:24.320]   Oh, man. If you're a parent and you've ever had
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.320]   to discipline your child, you can say the right
[01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.320]   things. You can say, "This is who God
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.320]   is," and if you use that to punitively
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:32.320]   take out your anger upon the person, that is
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.320]   expressly wrong.
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:38.320]   The heart, the medium
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.320]   is everything.
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.320]   So that when the truth comes out,
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:44.320]   that's good.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:48.320]   What about the pure things, pertaining to being
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.320]   without moral defect or blemish
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.320]   and pure? Purity of thought,
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.320]   purity of purpose,
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.320]   sexual purity.
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:58.320]   There is no disjointedness
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.320]   in a person. It's integrity.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.320]   It's someone who's virtuous and wholesome.
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.320]   Somebody who's without impurity.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.320]   Unmixed with filth.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.320]   And so, we can't think like
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.320]   we have to try to get a little better at this.
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:12.320]   The standard that's being talked about here
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.320]   is God's standard of purity.
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.320]   To dwell upon absolute purity,
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.320]   not just getting better. You see what I'm
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.320]   saying? It's not that we're trying to make ourselves
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.320]   pure. He's saying, dwell
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:24.320]   upon the pure things
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.320]   of God.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:30.320]   Other ways, stop
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.320]   looking at the garbage,
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.320]   the trashy things
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.320]   of the world. What about the lovely
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.320]   things? To dwell upon the lovely things
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.320]   is pertaining to that
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.320]   which causes people to be pleased
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:44.320]   with something. It is something that inspires
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:46.320]   love. There's an attractiveness to
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.320]   us, again, because there is no disjointedness.
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:50.320]   There is no hypocrisy in this.
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:52.320]   There's a person who says something
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.320]   and lives it out. There's nothing more
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.320]   ugly than somebody who says all these things but lives
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.320]   in a different way, right?
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.320]   It's just so unattractive when you see
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.320]   something like that. But somebody who's,
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.320]   like, for believers,
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.320]   we must be people who are lovely because
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.320]   not only are we saying all the right things,
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.320]   but our conduct and our behavior and our way
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.320]   of life looks just like the rest of the world. Is that
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.320]   what's going to be lovely in the eyes of the people?
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.320]   No. In the eyes of the people,
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.320]   that we must look lovely. Because
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.320]   not only are we saying that the things of the world
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.320]   are passing away, we are not partaking in those
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.320]   things because we believe it. And so
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.320]   our lives become lovely. It inspires
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:28.320]   awe of love in people
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.320]   and wonder.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:34.320]   Okay. Well,
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.320]   there's three more. Good repute, things that are excellent
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.320]   and praiseworthy, and I'll
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.320]   let you do the work.
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.320]   Now, there are plenty of us who can
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.320]   talk about each of the items on this list.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.320]   But the Christian
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.320]   is not just someone who's able to occasionally
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.320]   pull this out and let's talk about it, right?
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.320]   Like, pure
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.320]   things. Can we have Christians, like, talk
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.320]   about it? We can even debate it.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:58.320]   We can even try to persuade ourselves of the truth
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.320]   of God's Word.
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:04.320]   But the Christian
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.320]   is not somebody who's able to just talk about the things
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.320]   of God. Their lives
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.320]   talk about it, almost. It's almost kind of like
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.320]   that. The lives talk about it.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:14.320]   Our lives
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:16.320]   become a testing
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:18.320]   to the things that are being said.
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:20.320]   We have to say them.
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.320]   But our lives do not give us away.
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.320]   It supports it.
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:28.320]   We steep.
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:30.320]   We meditate.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.320]   We dwell on
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:34.320]   lofty, godly, beautiful
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.320]   things. And so we ourselves are becoming
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:38.320]   godly and beautiful.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.320]   We must dwell
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.320]   on these things and allow the Word of God
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:44.320]   to richly dwell in us. If we're not
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:46.320]   dwelling in these truths, you know what's happening?
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.320]   We're just steeping in the Word of God for
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:50.320]   one second every morning.
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.320]   Wondering, "Why isn't it changing me?"
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.320]   We just
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.320]   come in. It's not going to change you.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:02.320]   If we're not dwelling in the Word of God, then we're not
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.320]   allowing the Word of God even a chance
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.320]   to look into us and examine our hearts.
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:10.320]   This is the difference between someone who is walking
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.320]   with God and someone who has facts about God
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.320]   swirling around the brain. This is the difference
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.320]   between someone who is academic and scholarly
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:18.320]   concerning the things of the world and then somebody
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.320]   who is abiding in Him and thinking about
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.320]   and knowing about God
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:24.320]   on an intimate level. And I believe
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:26.320]   that this is the problem with many Christians and churches
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:28.320]   today, of which we ourselves, by the way,
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.320]   are not innocent. Especially as individuals,
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.320]   we are not innocent to these things.
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:34.320]   And it's been grieving in recent
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.320]   years. Not because of what the world
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.320]   has looked like. Can you guys agree
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.320]   with me on this one? That we're not grieving
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.320]   that just the world looks like this. The Bible
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.320]   has already told us what the world is and
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.320]   where the world is headed and what it's
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:48.320]   going to be like. The grieving that happens
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.320]   in us is when we see the
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:52.320]   proclaiming Christians.
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:56.320]   When we see the sin in us.
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:02.320]   And I think that's what's been happening in our society
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.320]   nowadays without getting too deep
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.320]   into this.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.320]   Wondering if this is why the
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.320]   words that are being used, the things that
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.320]   are being said, sound so similar
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:14.320]   to the unbelieving and secular world
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:16.320]   and how
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.320]   they would respond and speak
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:20.320]   into those same things.
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:22.320]   And of course, there's the
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.320]   "but for God's glory and to
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.320]   the glory of Christ" are added in there at the
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:28.320]   end. But just like
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.320]   somebody who would come up and say all
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.320]   the right things but has not been steeping
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.320]   in it, I wonder if perhaps
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.320]   that's why we look so much like the
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.320]   world.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:44.320]   I believe that even Christians have been
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:46.320]   dwelling, meditating, steeping
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:48.320]   and saturating in social media
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:50.320]   and stories and articles
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:52.320]   and friends
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.320]   and things that are ultimately man
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.320]   centered and not God centered. And so
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.320]   the results, though if you thought
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:00.320]   about those things in an appropriate way,
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:02.320]   the results would be godly. The results
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.320]   come out looking the way we see
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:06.320]   it today. And it's a spectrum.
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.320]   I'm not saying
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:10.320]   here's the line and we place everyone here, we place
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:12.320]   everyone here. That's just not
[01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.320]   good to do.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:16.320]   These tag
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.320]   lines of reparation and reconciliation,
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:20.320]   representation and repentance.
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.320]   All of these
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.320]   things in themselves, not wrong,
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:26.320]   maybe some things that must be and
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:28.320]   should be considered, though I think that today
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:30.320]   has hijacked it.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:32.320]   But it reveals and exposes
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.320]   what we've been dwelling upon.
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.320]   The thing central to God
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:38.320]   or not.
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:40.320]   I believe that many of us have been
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:42.320]   dwelling on these things. Now I'll take it to our
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.320]   third and last point, we must practice what we must
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:46.320]   dwell on.
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:48.320]   Verse 9,
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:50.320]   he continues by saying, "The things you have learned and received
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.320]   and heard and seen in me," he says, "practice these things."
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:54.320]   This means to do or to carry out
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.320]   or to perform. This means
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:58.320]   that the things that he calls us to
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:00.320]   think about, now you must go and do because
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.320]   these things again are not
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:04.320]   separated things, these are interrelated
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.320]   things. That when
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:08.320]   we say we believe something, if our
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.320]   actions do not follow, then we do not really
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.320]   believe those things.
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.320]   That this is because when we give our hearts,
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:16.320]   we give him everything about who we are.
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.320]   Our hearts is not something we rip out of our chest
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:20.320]   and say, "Here's my body, here's my flesh, and here you go."
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.320]   It's saying that I give you all
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:24.320]   that I am and so the practicing follows.
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.320]   And so he says, "All that you've learned
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:28.320]   and received and heard and seen,
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.320]   practice. Do it over
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:32.320]   and over and over again."
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:34.320]   So dwell on these things over
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:36.320]   and over and over again. Dwell
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:38.320]   on the things that are of God. Dwell on
[01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:40.320]   the good and lofty and beautiful things.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:42.320]   Dwell on the way in which
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:44.320]   that it would reveal to your own heart
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.320]   how you are, what you're like,
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:48.320]   how much you're in need of repentance, what God
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.320]   has done for you so that when you go out
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.320]   into the world, you become a steeped
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.320]   person, you become someone who has been changed,
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.320]   you are someone who is not
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.320]   espousing a bunch of things, and you're angry
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:00.320]   all the time, and you're frustrated all the
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.320]   time. I was so frustrated last week.
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.320]   And I know I was so frustrated
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.320]   because I saw what I was ruminating
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:08.320]   upon. I was on Twitter a little bit too much
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:10.320]   last week.
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.320]   But I had
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.320]   to catch myself and come back and I was so thankful
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:16.320]   for this passage that reminded me, "Remember
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.320]   God.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.320]   Remember the state of the world before
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.320]   God. Remember
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.320]   who He is." And then
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.320]   from there, out of the proper
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:28.320]   thinking, He says, "Practice."
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:32.320]   I think this is where a lot of talking
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.320]   needs to happen between us.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.320]   How are we going to do this?
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:40.320]   And He concludes
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:42.320]   at the end, He says, "And the God of
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:44.320]   peace will be with you." And I love that.
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.320]   He tags it at the end.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.320]   He did that, by the way, a few verses earlier.
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:50.320]   "And the peace of Christ will be with you."
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.320]   Don't we many times
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:54.320]   come before God in prayer asking for peace?
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:58.320]   Because our hearts are in such turmoil?
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.320]   Honestly, what we're saying is
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:02.320]   we're emotionally in disturbance.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.320]   We're saying, "Change that."
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:06.320]   And yet we're refusing to stop reading
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:08.320]   articles. You know what I mean?
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.320]   I'm not saying it's wrong to read the articles.
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:12.320]   They're just dwelling and thinking about these
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:14.320]   over and over again. You're wondering, "God, help me.
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:16.320]   Help me to be more humble. Help me to be
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.320]   more like this. Help me to be
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:20.320]   more like you." And then we're just constantly looking
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:22.320]   at these things. "God, please help me to do these
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:24.320]   things." And watch some more TV. "Please help me
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:26.320]   to do these things." And if we're to sit back
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.320]   and stop and look at the whole of our lives
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.320]   and ask ourselves, "What have we
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.320]   been steeping on? Where is our mind?"
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.320]   Please, today, would you take some
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:36.320]   time to consider where your minds have been?
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.320]   Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.320]   has a last
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.320]   thing.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.320]   Long quote. He says, "Faith
[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:46.320]   according to our Lord's teaching in the
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.320]   Sermon on the Mount is primarily thinking.
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.320]   The whole trouble with a man of little faith
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:52.320]   is that he does not think. He allows
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:54.320]   circumstances to bludgeon him. That is
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:56.320]   the real difficulty in life. Life
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:58.320]   comes to us with a club in its hand
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:00.320]   and strikes us upon the head, and we become
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:02.320]   incapable of thought, helpless and
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:04.320]   defeated. The way to avoid that according to
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.320]   our Lord is to think. We must spend
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:08.320]   more time in studying our Lord's lessons
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.320]   in observation and deduction. The Bible
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.320]   is full of logic, and we must never think
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.320]   of faith as something purely mystical.
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.320]   We do not just sit down in an armchair and expect
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:18.320]   marvelous things to happen to us. That is
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.320]   not Christian faith. Christian
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:22.320]   faith is essentially thinking. Look at the
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.320]   birds. Think about them.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.320]   Draw your deductions. Look at the
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:28.320]   grass. Look at the lilies of the field and consider them.
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:30.320]   The trouble with most people, however,
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.320]   is that they will not think. Instead of
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:34.320]   doing this, they sit down and ask, "What is going to happen
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.320]   to me? What can I do?" That
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.320]   is the absence of thought. It is
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:40.320]   surrender. It is defeat. Our
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.320]   Lord here is urging us to think, and
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:44.320]   to think in a Christian manner. That is
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.320]   the very essence of faith. Faith,
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:48.320]   if you like, can be defined like this.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:50.320]   It is a man insisting upon thinking
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:52.320]   when everything seems determined to bludgeon and
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.320]   knock him down in an intellectual sense.
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.320]   The trouble with the person of little faith is that
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.320]   instead of controlling his own thought, his thought
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.320]   is being controlled by something else.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.320]   And as we put it, he goes round and round
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:04.320]   in circles. That is the essence of
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.320]   worry. That is not thought. That is
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:08.320]   the absence of thought, a failure to
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:10.320]   think. I want to conclude by
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:12.320]   because it's Father's Day,
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.320]   just the last point of application.
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:16.320]   Fathers, this is the most important
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:18.320]   thing for us as fathers in this room,
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.320]   to be people who dwell on the good
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.320]   things of God. Take time
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.320]   to really think about what you've been
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:26.320]   dwelling on. It could be
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.320]   the obviously distracting things,
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:30.320]   but it could also be the things that you're trying
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:32.320]   to give which are
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.320]   kind of good to the children.
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.320]   Just like how when we steep our hearts,
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:38.320]   it's going to shape us and change us,
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.320]   as fathers, as husbands,
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:42.320]   it is going to shape and change our families
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:44.320]   as well. It's going to happen.
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:46.320]   As we go, our families go.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.320]   As we go, our wives will
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:50.320]   go. They are called to submit to
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:52.320]   us. As we go, the children
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:54.320]   are called to obey us.
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.320]   If you have not been dwelling
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:58.320]   on the things of God, it is expressly
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:00.320]   important for us, every father
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.320]   in this room, to say, "Today, as for me
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:04.320]   and my household, we will serve the Lord." Let's pray.
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.320]   Heavenly Father,
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:08.320]   we thank you for your truths, and we
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.320]   pray, God, for more of your Spirit to come
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:12.320]   and help us, that your Spirit
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:14.320]   might richly
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.320]   allow the Word of God
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.320]   to dwell within us, but God, that it
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.320]   would not be simply mystical, but that we would
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.320]   be doing the work of coming before
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:24.320]   you, of giving to you all
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.320]   our thoughts and everything we've been meditating and
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.320]   looking and thinking and dwelling upon,
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.320]   and God, to surrender to you and say,
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:32.320]   "God, all this is yours." Would you take our entire
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:34.320]   hearts today? In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.320]   Amen.
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:38.320]   Amen.
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:42.320]   Let us all rise as we sing our closing
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:44.320]   praise.
