[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.040]   >> All right, good morning, church family.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.660]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.040]   Hope you had a good week with the Lord.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.640]   As always, it's a privilege for us to gather together for worship.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.940]   And this morning, we're going to start with the hymn,
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.820]   "Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus."
[00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.080]   And like many hymns, this hymn was written in the midst of
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.940]   and as a result of great tragedy and loss.
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.760]   In 1880, Louisa Stead lost her husband in a tragic accident
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.900]   when he drowned in the ocean trying to save a young boy.
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.980]   And it was from this experience of losing her husband
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.680]   in these dark moments of sorrow and grief that she turned
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.980]   to her savior, Jesus Christ, and she wrote the lyrics,
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.180]   "Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus, just to take him at his word,
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.100]   just to rest upon his promise and to know,
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.220]   thus saith the Lord."
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.000]   And through these verses,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.320]   Louisa expressed her complete reliance on God's promise
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.380]   and found peace and hope in trusting the savior
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.060]   who carried her through every trial.
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.300]   So in the same way, as we sing this well-known hymn,
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.720]   may we find strength and solace in knowing
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.680]   that we serve a savior, we have a savior who loves us deeply
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.600]   and will carry us through every storm, every trial,
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.460]   every circumstance that life brings us.
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.220]   Let's sing together.

[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.020]   Good morning, church family.
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.520]   If you guys are here for the first time, welcome to Berean Community Church.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.520]   We have a welcome table outside.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.520]   So if you wanted more information about the church and just our core visions
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.520]   and what goes on during the course of the week, you can stop by there.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.520]   I have a couple of announcements that I want to just call your attention to.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.520]   The first one is for all the ladies that are at our church.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:50.520]   Next Saturday between 8 to about 12.30 p.m., we have a very special woman's conference,
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.520]   and the theme is Set Apart.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.520]   If you haven't signed up for it already but you want to come,
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.520]   please do sign up so we can take into account how many refreshments we need,
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.520]   how many tables we need, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.520]   So it's $15, and a light breakfast is included.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.520]   So if you have any questions, you can contact Nicole Mose.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.520]   Two weeks from now, this is for all the members of our church,
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.520]   we have a mandatory members meeting, which is quarterly.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.520]   And after this one, we're going to have a service fair.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:25.520]   So if you wanted to figure out how to serve in this church as we keep growing,
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.520]   there are going to be opportunities for you to just plug in and get involved as well.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.520]   2 p.m. Sunday, April 21st, we will have a fundraiser lunch,
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.520]   so you don't need to leave the campus.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.520]   Our career missions team is going to make food for us,
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.520]   and obviously you have to pay for it.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.520]   So just know that that's going on as well.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.520]   As we've been mentioning the last several weeks,
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:55.520]   we have a special seminar on May 4th at 9 a.m. here in the sanctuary,
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.520]   and we're going to be looking at how to think through biblically
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:05.520]   the sensitive subjects of abortion, birth control, and IVF, in vitro fertilization.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.520]   So don't miss that.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.520]   We've moved things around our calendar so that everyone can participate and come to that.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.520]   So the other announcements, you can look on your app or online.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.520]   We're going to take a time of offering,
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.520]   and we have a physical box in the back over there near the exit.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:29.520]   Otherwise, you can give your offering to the Lord just through electronic transfer.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:35.520]   And after the praise set, we're going to have our sister Hope Jin come up.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.520]   She's going to share her testimony and be baptized.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.520]   But let me pray for us.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.520]   Lord, we come before you this morning just eager to hear from you,
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.520]   asking you to feed your sheep.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:54.520]   And, Lord, that you would take the center stage and that your word would be proclaimed,
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.520]   that Christ would be honored and held in high esteem,
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   and that we would walk out of here as fed and changed people.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:07.520]   So we thank you, Lord, for the joy of gathering together this Lord's Day,
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.520]   and pray this in Jesus' name.

[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.140]   - Thank you.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:26.700]   Okay.
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:30.620]   I was raised in a Christian family
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.040]   and grew up going to church.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.540]   God blessed me with family and friends
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.840]   who have prayed for me my whole life
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.440]   and who brought me to solid Bible teaching churches.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.800]   Throughout my life, the Lord has shown me so much mercy
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.540]   by giving me an easy time to spite my ignorance,
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.940]   sinfulness, and acknowledge selfishness.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.460]   Growing up, I never had doubts
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.780]   that the facts of the Bible were true.
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.140]   During elementary and middle school,
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.060]   I probably would have told you that I was a Christian
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.480]   'cause I believed that Jesus died on the cross for my sins.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.420]   My life, however, was no reflection of this.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.620]   I didn't consider the Lord and his way,
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.580]   and his will in the way I lived my life,
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.620]   and I kept myself at the center of my thoughts and actions.
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.540]   Every decision I made and desire I had was rooted in pride,
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.780]   and I had no thought to devote anything
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.400]   the Lord had blessed me with back to him.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.240]   Looking back, though,
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.980]   even though I knew the Bible to be true,
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.980]   I had not accepted it as truth in my own life.
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.980]   I had failed to acknowledge the weight of my own sin
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:24.900]   and my need for a Savior.
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.780]   Around high school,
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.420]   God revealed to me my lack of true salvation.
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.940]   I knew that I hadn't truly accepted Christ as my Savior
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.440]   because I had no assurance of faith.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.760]   Despite that realization,
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.360]   I still carried on in my sinful ignorance.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.740]   I knew that works couldn't save me
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.260]   and that the prospect of my salvation
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.220]   had already been predetermined before the beginning of time,
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.940]   so I waited for the Lord to save me
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.740]   without seeking him back.
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.660]   Aside from routine attendance at church
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.460]   and the occasional prayer for God to save me,
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.160]   I was done in my walk with Christ.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.160]   By God's grace,
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.700]   I was able to go to college not too far from my home
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.020]   and continue going to the church
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.540]   that my family was attending at the time.
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:01.900]   Being in a campus ministry,
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.900]   I was struck by how many people young as I was
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.980]   had such a fervent and constant love for the Lord.
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:08.980]   This piqued my interest,
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.180]   and the occasional thoughts I had
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.400]   about wanting to be saved before became more prevalent.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.100]   It began to weigh heavy on me,
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.320]   and I became more eager for a relationship with God.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.160]   Through this all,
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.340]   he blessed me with people in my life
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.260]   who could answer my questions and pray for me,
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.720]   and they all encouraged me to consider his death
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.620]   and resurrection and to pray to learn
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.740]   about the God I wanted to love.
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:29.780]   In my search for him,
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.100]   I learned that my sin made me helpless before the throne.
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.740]   My sin kept me apart from him,
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.980]   and it's only by his mercy
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.520]   that I could have a relationship with him.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.740]   Though I had said prayers of repentance before,
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.220]   I now understood why it was necessary.
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.300]   Understanding more now
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.460]   how my own sins had crucified the son,
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.340]   I prayed a new prayer in which I repented
[00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.180]   and professed my desire to live a life for the Lord,
[00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.840]   submitting to his will and dismissing my own.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.240]   The Lord was in full control of my salvation.
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.000]   None of this was my own doing,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.600]   and it was all according to his will.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.140]   Since then, until my senior year,
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.800]   I went through occasional seasons of doubt
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.400]   about my assurance of faith.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.560]   I doubted that the Lord had really saved me,
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.120]   but faithful leaders encouraged me
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.740]   to consider God's justice and promises.
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.380]   My doubt was rooted in lack of faith
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.740]   and a distrust of the Lord,
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.060]   which is a sin that hindered my spiritual growth.
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.920]   This also called for repentance.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.560]   As always, the Lord showed me mercy
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.000]   in granting me assurance,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.180]   which has been such a blessing.
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.860]   I now desire and pursue a true relationship with him
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.420]   that's not driven by transaction,
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.700]   but by a love for my maker.
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.800]   As I've prayed for him to grow me in my faith,
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.920]   he has granted me peace in knowing that his plan is perfect.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.100]   As I've prayed for him to grow my love for his people,
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.660]   he has placed so many people in my life
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.180]   who faithfully reach out
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.940]   and offer me opportunities to join in fellowship.
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.020]   And as I asked him to help me love him more,
[00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.700]   he continually demonstrates his own love for me.
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.820]   It's so clear that he has been good in my life.
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.820]   Though I have committed to life with the Lord
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.800]   and apart from my sin,
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.620]   I still struggle to set aside my pride and selfishness
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.100]   and I fail often.
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.780]   But compared to my life before Christ,
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.620]   I have an understanding
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:09.900]   that I can't overcome my sins by my own efforts.
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.820]   My sanctification is his doing.
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:14.360]   It's clear that I can never do enough
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.680]   to be deserving of God's love and protection.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.480]   And it's only through his grace
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.840]   that I'm a beneficiary of these things.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.360]   Nothing I do will make me deserving
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.720]   and I love him for giving me these things,
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.640]   or for giving these things to me despite that.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.960]   I am here today 'cause I want to be baptized
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.000]   in an act of obedience to the Lord.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.600]   I pray that in sharing my testimony with the body of Christ,
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.260]   the other members might hold me accountable
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.400]   to living out the gospel and being a light.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.560]   (audience applauding)
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:53.260]   - Hope, why don't you come on up?
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.820]   I've always kind of wanted to have baptisms
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.180]   where we dunk the person
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.340]   and then hold them down for about two minutes
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.460]   so they can experience
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:05.560]   what union with Christ in his death feels like.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.300]   And then her dad said, "Let's do it."
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.380]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.220]   I'm just kidding.
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.380]   But it's an honor to have Andrew up here with me.
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.180]   You want to scoot up a little bit and take my left hand?
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.440]   It's gonna be quick, okay?
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.520]   It's not gonna be two minutes.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.420]   Hope, do you understand when you go into the water,
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.900]   you're being united with Christ in his death,
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:24.740]   and when you come out,
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.440]   you're united with him in his resurrection?
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.360]   - Yes.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.380]   - I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.040]   and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:38.580]   (audience applauding)
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.540]   (audience cheering)
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:51.020]   - I'm always encouraged when we have
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:55.140]   just the father up here helping with the baptism.
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.940]   Most likely, this is an answered prayer
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.420]   from when the child was in the womb,
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.260]   and so this is a very special moment.
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.900]   If you have your Bibles with me,
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:08.720]   please turn to the book of Job, chapter 42.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.540]   And I want to read verses seven to nine.
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.700]   And it would be helpful for you
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.380]   to keep your Bibles open to Job
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.180]   as we will be flipping through it,
[00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:22.020]   or you can follow up on the screen.
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.320]   Job 42, seven to nine reads,
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.500]   it came about after the Lord had spoken these words to Job
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.540]   that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite,
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.620]   "My wrath is kindled against you
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.580]   "and against your two friends,
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.440]   "because you have not spoken of me what is right,
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.060]   "as my servant Job has.
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.980]   "Now, therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:49.100]   "and seven rams, and go to my servant Job,
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.180]   "and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves,
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.360]   "and my servant Job will pray for you.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:59.860]   "For I will accept him, so that I may not do with you,
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.840]   "according to your folly,
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.920]   "because you have not spoken of me what is right,
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.620]   "as my servant Job has."
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.340]   So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.220]   and Zophar the Naamathite went and did
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:17.180]   as the Lord told them, and the Lord accepted Job.
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.180]   Let's pray together.
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:23.860]   Father, as your word is proclaimed,
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:28.860]   would you be just high and lifted up?
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.420]   Would you receive just the worship
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.920]   and the glory that you're due?
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:40.460]   Cause us, Lord, to listen, both with fear and trembling,
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.300]   but with great boldness and joy,
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.400]   knowing that you delight in your children.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:49.220]   We pray that your word will bear fruit in our lives,
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.780]   in this church, and in the community around us.
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:57.300]   So would you really bless our time together?
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:58.700]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:04.600]   So week after week, and Sunday after Sunday,
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.440]   we gather together like this for worship.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.600]   We join together to sing of a God
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.840]   and to declare and affirm truths
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.560]   of a God who is infinitely different from us.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.920]   We have been created in his image,
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.360]   but we know, at least theologically,
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.160]   that his ways are not our ways,
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.780]   and his thoughts are not like our thoughts.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.500]   And the scriptures tell us that as high
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.660]   as the heavens are above the earth,
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:35.160]   so are his ways and his thoughts so much higher than ours.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.240]   And there are biblical truths that most every one of us
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.060]   in this room will affirm as truth
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.500]   and consider to be in accord with sound doctrine.
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:47.540]   For example, God is good.
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.900]   God is love.
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:53.340]   He is worthy of all of our worship.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.460]   Would you say amen to those three truths?
[00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:03.460]   I would, and I believe most of you would as well.
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.460]   How about the next following statements?
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:11.060]   God is all-powerful, God's will is perfect,
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:14.460]   he makes no mistakes.
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.300]   Amen?
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.660]   A lot of you are nodding.
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.200]   If you are affirming that all the statements
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.460]   I just made are true, you are affirming then
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:27.020]   that God has not made one single mistake in your life.
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:31.580]   Every single person, every circumstance,
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.700]   every humbling failure, every hardship,
[00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:39.580]   and even trauma has been ordained on purpose
[00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.940]   in your life by this God.
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.240]   This God who is good, this God who is love,
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.040]   this God who is perfect in power,
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.100]   and who is worthy of all of our worship.
[00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.740]   Not one single mistake.
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:59.820]   Now there may be some discomfort now
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.020]   welling up in your hearts.
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.460]   There may be a slight disconnect in what you believe
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.860]   and confess to be theologically true
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:12.500]   from how you emotionally feel about these truths.
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.740]   There may be a little bit of a pushback in your heart,
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:19.860]   and it's possible that you can't quite put a finger on why.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   God is good, he is just, he is merciful.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.300]   In his goodness, justice, and mercy,
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.040]   God ordains affliction and suffering,
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:39.020]   even on those who are innocent,
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:44.120]   especially on those who are innocent.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:48.300]   If you're coming up with a biblical theology,
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.660]   you cannot but land on this conclusion.
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:57.360]   And this suffering of the innocent, of the righteous,
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.300]   is very much a part of God's good, pleasing,
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.580]   and perfect will.
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:05.280]   Our faith is founded on this.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:08.260]   And by way of reminder,
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:12.500]   we just celebrated this profound truth a week ago
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.180]   as we walked through the events of the Passion Week,
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:18.580]   of Good Friday, and of Resurrection Sunday.
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.900]   Isaiah 53, four to five, reads,
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.460]   "Surely our griefs he himself bore,
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:28.040]   "and our sorrows he carried.
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:31.340]   "Yet we ourselves esteemed him stricken,
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.940]   "smitten of God, and afflicted.
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.780]   "But he was pierced through for our transgressions,
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.200]   "he was crushed for our iniquities.
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.340]   "The chastening for our well-being fell upon him,
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:46.100]   "and by his scourging we are healed."
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.300]   Beautiful passage.
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.500]   And this Isaiah 53 passage continues on
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.300]   in describing the suffering, innocent Messiah,
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.460]   and it gets even better,
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:00.180]   and more profound, and more uncomfortable in verse 10.
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:07.220]   "The Lord was pleased to crush him, putting him to grief."
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.880]   The Lord was pleased to crush him.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:16.700]   Again, these are all truths that we affirm,
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.100]   truths that we confess,
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.500]   but truths that nonetheless leave us
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.960]   feeling a little uncomfortable, or a lot uncomfortable.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.100]   The Lord's ways are not our ways,
[00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.100]   the Lord's thoughts are not our thoughts.
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.920]   In God's people, week after week,
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.460]   we do our best to worship in spirit and in truth,
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:40.660]   and at times, this in-truth part
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.660]   may be profoundly uncomfortable.
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:45.740]   And this has always been the case.
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:50.100]   So it's no shock that a book like the Book of Job,
[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.780]   filled with uncomfortable doctrinal truths,
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.280]   has been a beloved book of God's people
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.100]   for thousands of years.
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.900]   Some believe that the Book of Job
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.000]   may even be the first book written in the Old Testament.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.880]   It's a very uncomfortable book.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:11.060]   And at the same time, it's a very comforting book.
[00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:15.340]   The passage that I read for you in the beginning
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:18.980]   is found in the very last chapter of the Book of Job.
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:22.300]   Job 42.7.9 comes just after
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.780]   one of the greatest statements of worship
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.460]   we see in the entire scriptures.
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:31.060]   And it comes just before we read about
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.820]   God's double-recompensing Job
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.580]   for all that he suffered and lost.
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:39.540]   And Job 42.7.9 is the passage
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.980]   that we'll primarily be looking at today
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.340]   and launching off of.
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:48.800]   And Job 42 reads like a standard happy ending.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.180]   But if you're familiar with the book,
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:54.880]   you know that the first 41 chapters
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.220]   are filled with nothing remotely happy.
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:01.460]   Most people immediately think of the theme of suffering
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.160]   when the Book of Job is mentioned.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.460]   And suffering, of course, is the backdrop of the book.
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.240]   A good, loving, all-powerful God
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:16.120]   will allow his beloved children to suffer.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:20.240]   It is profound and mysterious,
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:24.340]   but the book ends with a great reward for Job,
[00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.280]   the persevering, suffering servant.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:31.080]   And because of this, and because we all like happy endings,
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.600]   it's a well-loved book for many Christians today.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.240]   Nadrez, if you like the Book of Job, you've read it.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.820]   Yeah?
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.800]   The Book of Job has long been one of the favorite books
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.800]   of the Hebrew nation as well.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.560]   And but for reasons beyond
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:51.440]   the seemingly unfair sufferings of a righteous man,
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.700]   the Book of Job is a fascinating book.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:58.380]   Job the man is a very fascinating character.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.400]   First of all, there is no indication
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.080]   that Job is an Israelite.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:08.080]   The Book of Job begins with a mention of a place
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.760]   that is outside of Israel in the land called Uz,
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.520]   which we cannot easily identify today.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.400]   The geographical places named in the book
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:20.800]   suggest that Job is a Gentile, likely an Edomite.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.160]   No one knows who wrote this lengthy book.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.240]   No one knows when it was even written.
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:31.380]   But most scholars place Job after the time of Noah
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:34.040]   and before the time of Abraham.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.360]   And as I mentioned before,
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.060]   it could very well be the oldest book in the Bible.
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:43.020]   And what's fascinating is you have to remember
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:48.020]   the people of Israel are a very proud, ethnocentric people,
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:51.560]   and yet this book, whose main character
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:55.760]   is a godly non-Israelite living outside the borders
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.700]   of Israel, has been celebrated
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.460]   throughout all of Israel's history.
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:03.940]   There is not a mention of any Mosaic law
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:06.620]   or any significant covenant.
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.860]   Without any acquaintance with Moses and the prophets,
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:14.780]   it nevertheless appears that Job is intimately familiar
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.380]   with the god of whom Moses and the prophets spoke.
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:23.260]   The Book of Job uses the name Yahweh 31 times.
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.180]   And we don't know how Job learned it.
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:28.100]   We don't know why he uses it.
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:33.960]   We know from Exodus chapter 33 that no mortal man
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:38.960]   can see God and live, but it seems that this Gentile man
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:43.440]   beheld God with his physical eyes.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.060]   Again, fascinating.
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.880]   Who was this man?
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.980]   How righteous was this man that he didn't perish
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.640]   upon beholding Lord Yahweh?
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:02.040]   So it almost feels like a fairy tale for the Hebrew people.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.120]   It would be a natural and logical thing
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.060]   to categorize the Book of Job as a fairy tale
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:12.180]   if not for all the mentions of Job
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.680]   and references to the Book of Job all over the Bible.
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:21.000]   Many Psalms read similarly to sections of Job.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.520]   King Solomon, it looks on the surface, borrowed from Job
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.240]   as there are many parallels to verses
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.880]   in Proverbs and Ecclesiastes.
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:33.400]   Isaiah chapter 40 verse 13, Isaiah quotes Job.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.480]   The prophet Ezekiel mentions Job.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.380]   And to help us to understand how real
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:42.840]   and how historical Job the man was to the people of Israel,
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:45.680]   I wanna read you a couple verses from Ezekiel.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:47.880]   Chapter 14 verses 13 to 14.
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:51.280]   Son of man, if a country sins against me
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.520]   by committing unfaithfulness
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.160]   and I stretch out my hand against it,
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.760]   destroy its supply of bread,
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.200]   send famine against it,
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.560]   and cut off from it both man and beast,
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.680]   even though these three men, Noah, Daniel,
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.000]   and Job were in its midst,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.480]   by their own righteousness
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:10.180]   they could only deliver themselves, declares the Lord God.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:15.120]   So Yahweh God speaks of Job to the prophet Ezekiel.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.440]   Job is a Gentile man,
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:23.220]   and he is and has always been a well-known symbol
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:27.860]   and beacon of righteousness to all the people of God.
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:31.940]   The Apostle Paul quotes the book of Job twice,
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:34.860]   Romans 11.35 and 1 Corinthians 3.19.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:38.580]   The first is a quote from Job 41.11,
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:40.780]   the second one is out of Job 5.13.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:45.380]   Now this is a pretty lengthy introduction,
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:49.380]   but since this contains a somewhat familiar story,
[00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:52.540]   and because many people have varying thoughts,
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:55.980]   presumptions, and opinions on this book,
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:00.180]   I wanted to hedge in our thoughts and our collective focus.
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:03.200]   And I wanted to anchor our understanding
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.500]   that the main character of the book of Job
[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.500]   is not Job the man,
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.980]   but omniscient Yahweh,
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:15.020]   who is sovereign over all the universe.
[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:17.560]   Make sense?
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.900]   The main character of the book of Job
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.820]   is not the man Job, it is God.
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.540]   The main character of the book of Job
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:29.020]   is Yahweh God who burns with anger
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:33.860]   at false doctrine and misrepresentations of his nature.
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.660]   He is a God who burns with anger
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:39.420]   when he is misrepresented,
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:44.180]   but one who absolutely delights in his servants,
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:47.200]   especially when they speak rightly of him,
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.700]   even in the face of suffering.
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:51.580]   So I wanna provide you with the outline
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.140]   of Job 42, verses seven and nine,
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.180]   to help you track the thought flow through this passage.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:00.420]   And hopefully the title of the sermon,
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:03.260]   God's Suffering Servant,
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.780]   helps you remember and track the outline.
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:09.140]   God's Suffering Servant.
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:12.100]   First, we're gonna look at verse seven,
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.580]   the character of God.
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:18.540]   And you see God's anger burn
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:21.260]   against three well-meaning individuals.
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:25.860]   And then conversely, we can see what delights the heart of God
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:29.420]   then we're gonna be looking at the second point,
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:32.500]   just the backdrop of suffering,
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:33.740]   and we're gonna be looking through
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:35.380]   the context of the book of Job for this,
[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:36.980]   especially chapters one and two.
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:40.860]   And then we'll be looking at the third point,
[00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.600]   which is the acceptance of a servant,
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.700]   verses eight and nine.
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:50.820]   The Lord calls Job, my servant Job,
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:52.420]   six times in the book,
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:56.080]   and three times in verse eight alone.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.380]   So it's almost with a great sense of pride
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.900]   that God refers to Job,
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.140]   as we'll soon see.
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:09.420]   Verses eight and nine mention twice that God accepts Job
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.780]   for the purpose of forgiving the folly,
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:16.000]   the heresy, and the blasphemy of his three friends.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.220]   So it's fascinating.
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:20.300]   And we're gonna look into that.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:21.360]   And then at the end, we're gonna see
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.740]   what appropriate responses and applications
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:27.940]   that we can draw today from this ancient but timeless text.
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.940]   Okay, so let me read Job 42, seven to nine again for us.
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:35.940]   It came about after the Lord had spoken these words to Job,
[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.380]   that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite,
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:41.100]   my wrath is kindled against you
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.740]   and against your two friends,
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.660]   because you have not spoken to me
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:48.060]   what is right as my servant Job has.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:50.500]   Now therefore, take for yourselves
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:53.260]   seven bulls and seven rams.
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:56.020]   Go to my servant Job and offer up
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:57.820]   a burnt offering for yourselves,
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:00.740]   and my servant Job will pray for you,
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:05.300]   for I will accept him so that I may not do with you
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.140]   according to your folly,
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.420]   because you have not spoken to me what is right
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.980]   as my servant Job has.
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:15.380]   So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:19.900]   and Zophar the Amethyte went and did as the Lord told them,
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:22.740]   and the Lord accepted Job.
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:27.500]   So we get a glimpse into the character of God in verse seven.
[00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:32.700]   And in these verses, we can observe that God's anger
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.940]   and his delight are connected with his glory
[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.740]   and to the truths of his character and nature.
[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:41.340]   And that's consistent with other parts of scripture.
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:47.300]   God must and will be presented as holy, amen?
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:54.460]   All creation must accurately declare the glories of God.
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.940]   And in verse seven, we see that God's anger,
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:03.940]   his wrath is kindled by misrepresentations of him
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:06.260]   from Job's three friends.
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:11.980]   You have not spoken of me what is right.
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:16.140]   So from Job chapter three to chapter 31,
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.500]   there are three cycles of dialogues
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:22.140]   between Job and his three well-meaning friends.
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:25.980]   And as a result, God's anger is kindled.
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.660]   But before we look into why God's anger burns,
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:34.660]   I wanna walk us through what Job's three friends did right.
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.260]   Okay, so if you have your Bible,
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:39.060]   turn to Job chapter two, verses 11 to 13.
[00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:47.540]   Now, when Job's three friends heard of all this adversity
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:50.700]   that had come upon him, they came each one
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.780]   from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite,
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:57.220]   Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Amethyte,
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:59.140]   and they made an appointment together
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:02.820]   to come to sympathize with him and comfort him.
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:06.460]   And when they lifted up their eyes at a distance
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:09.700]   and did not even recognize him,
[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:12.900]   they raised their voices and wept.
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.940]   And each of them tore his robe.
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:18.580]   They threw dust over their heads toward the sky.
[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:20.380]   And then they sat down on the ground with him
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.100]   for seven days and seven nights
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.620]   with no one speaking a word to him,
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:30.300]   for they saw that his pain was very great.
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.940]   So in some ways, these three men,
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:35.380]   they get a pretty bad rep.
[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:39.020]   And unfortunately, their bad rep has been recorded
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:41.020]   for all of human history.
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:44.580]   But they were very well-meaning.
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.620]   And that's more than evident.
[00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:48.900]   They hear of Job's suffering,
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.420]   and then they intentionally come together
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:56.180]   to sympathize and to comfort Job.
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:59.860]   And I believe that they were genuinely horrified
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:03.540]   at Job's appearance and his lot.
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.940]   And they wept.
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:07.820]   This is a loud weeping.
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:10.140]   It's a wailing.
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:13.620]   Job's body is covered from head to toe
[00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:18.460]   with horrible boils and slimy blisters.
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:22.540]   He was their friend who had lost everything.
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:25.660]   So they wept.
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:27.620]   And these three men sat and camped with him
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:31.340]   for seven days and seven nights.
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.740]   I don't know how many of us could sit just silently
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:39.900]   with someone for even seven awkward minutes.
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.900]   But these three men just sat for seven days and seven nights
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.900]   without speaking a word to him.
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.620]   So they're good friends.
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:50.580]   So what did they do?
[00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:54.500]   And what did they say that was so wrong,
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:47:00.940]   wrong enough to incur the wrath of God?
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:04.580]   I combed through chapters 3 through 31.
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:06.700]   And if you comb through chapters 3 through 31
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:09.500]   and carefully examine these men's speeches,
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:14.980]   it's actually very difficult to discern where they were wrong.
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.740]   Some of what they said would actually make
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:20.500]   very good Bible memory verses.
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:21.820]   And I'll give you a sample of something
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.980]   Eliphaz the Temanite said.
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:30.700]   Job 5.13, "He captures the wise by their own shrewdness,
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:35.180]   and the advice of the cunning is quickly thwarted."
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:37.980]   Does this look familiar?
[00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:39.620]   This is what Apostle Paul quoted
[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:44.420]   in 1 Corinthians 3.19 as scripture.
[00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:49.180]   So how did these men err in what they said?
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.060]   The overarching assumption of these men
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:53.340]   was that Job was suffering because he
[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:57.540]   had done something wrong, because he had somehow
[00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:00.060]   violated God's laws.
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:03.260]   If you suffer, that means you offended God
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:04.740]   and God is cursing you.
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:07.780]   That was their logic.
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:11.380]   And though it is true that there are serious consequences
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:14.940]   and repercussions to our sins, Job
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:20.540]   was simply suffering because God purposed it.
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:23.700]   God okayed it.
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:27.180]   God had determined it to be part of his good, pleasing,
[00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:30.060]   and perfect will.
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:34.020]   Job had done nothing wrong.
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:41.140]   And Job's good, loving, omnipotent God
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:44.740]   purposed his sufferings.
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:48.580]   And he was justified in doing so.
[00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:52.620]   He remained good in doing so.
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:58.180]   He was still the everlasting God of love in doing so.
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:03.660]   He delighted in Job while doing so.
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:09.660]   God allows for suffering, and this allowing of suffering
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:13.100]   does not go against his attributes of goodness, love,
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:14.140]   wisdom, and justice.
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.500]   And I want to repeat that.
[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:20.820]   God's allowing for suffering, and this
[00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:26.620]   does not go against his attributes of goodness, love,
[00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:29.980]   wisdom, and justice.
[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:31.860]   God is creator.
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:34.100]   He is a king of kings and lord of lords.
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:35.780]   He's the author of life.
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:36.980]   He is the potter.
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:40.620]   You and I are but the clay.
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:45.700]   God ordains man's physical sufferings from disease.
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:50.820]   God ordains emotional suffering of loss, disappointment,
[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:53.420]   and tragedy.
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.460]   He ordains financial ruin.
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:50:02.420]   He ordains social suffering.
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:06.220]   He even ordains national sufferings,
[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:10.180]   and yet remains a God who is perfectly good, perfectly
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:14.020]   loving, and perfectly just.
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:15.100]   Are you uncomfortable yet?
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:22.820]   Is there not some discomfort that is in your heart?
[00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:30.140]   Job's three friends fail to affirm all of these truths.
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:36.460]   And though Job becomes more and more whiny
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:38.100]   throughout the course of the book-- man,
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:40.820]   this man just whines throughout for chapters.
[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:43.700]   He becomes super whiny.
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:48.020]   And though he complained a bunch of how all of his sufferings
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:52.260]   felt unfair and unjust, he almost always
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.900]   spoke rightly of God.
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:56.860]   So I want to read a couple of passages for you.
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:51:00.260]   Job 1, 20 to 22.
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:03.220]   "Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head.
[00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:04.940]   And he fell to the ground and worshipped.
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.380]   He said, naked I came from my mother's womb,
[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:09.180]   and naked I shall return there.
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:11.260]   The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away.
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:12.780]   Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:17.660]   And through all of this, Job did not sin, nor did he blame God."
[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:19.340]   Job 2, 9 to 10.
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:21.460]   "Then his wife said to him, do you still
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:24.140]   hold fast your integrity?
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:25.940]   Curse God and die."
[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:29.100]   Satan was strategic in leaving the wife alive.
[00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:34.100]   "But he said to her, you speak as one of the foolish women
[00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:35.220]   speaks."
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:38.020]   So he's calling his wife a dummy.
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:41.220]   "Shall we indeed accept good from God
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:43.340]   and not accept adversity?
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:49.660]   And in all this, Job did not sin with his lips."
[00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:53.300]   So in this confession, Job points to God
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:57.100]   as not only the source of good, but also the source
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:00.060]   of adversity.
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:04.940]   We need to watch our lives and doctrines closely.
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:08.900]   We need to accurately proclaim the excellencies of God
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:12.100]   and present him as holy, as completely other,
[00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:16.180]   far different from us.
[00:52:16.180 --> 00:52:19.460]   We don't need to try and sugarcoat difficult doctrines
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:23.460]   to make them more palatable to the world.
[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:28.580]   We never need to apologize for God.
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:35.500]   We just need to know God and make him known accurately.
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.220]   Amen?
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:41.580]   As Charles Spurgeon once said, the word of God is like a lion.
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:44.500]   You don't have to defend the lion.
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:47.300]   All you have to do is let the lion loose,
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:50.500]   and the lion will defend itself.
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:54.660]   Blasphemy, by definition, is an impious utterance or action
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:55.780]   concerning God.
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:53:01.020]   So it's to speak defiantly or irreverently about God.
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:02.180]   Blasphemy.
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:06.620]   Heresy is belief or opinion contrary
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:08.820]   to any biblical truth of God.
[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:13.900]   So any form of these misrepresentations of God
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:17.180]   kindles his anger.
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:21.380]   When we suffer or when those around us suffer,
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:23.260]   this doesn't mean that we go up in their face
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:24.580]   and says, God has ordained this.
[00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:25.100]   Ha, ha.
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:28.380]   Like, you don't do that.
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:31.380]   It doesn't mean that we don't act with grace and compassion.
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:35.100]   We don't-- it doesn't mean we don't listen.
[00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:41.220]   But we must always take care not to fail in speaking of God what
[00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:46.540]   is right, especially when we see or when we are
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.780]   going through great suffering.
[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:54.860]   We need to weep with those who weep.
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:59.260]   But while we weep, it is absolutely imperative
[00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:06.020]   to take great care to represent Yahweh God accurately.
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:07.340]   Amen?
[00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:09.060]   This brings me to our second point, which
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:10.500]   is the backdrop of the suffering.
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:12.300]   If you have your Bibles, I'd like
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:14.980]   for you to turn to the beginning of the book of Job.
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:17.140]   If you're new to the church or to the faith
[00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:19.020]   and you've never heard of Job, allow
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:20.980]   me to help you get better acquainted with him.
[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:25.020]   Job chapter 1, verses 1 to 3.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:30.100]   "There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job.
[00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:33.100]   And that man was blameless, upright, fearing God,
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:34.420]   and turning away from evil."
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:35.780]   I'm going to pause here.
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:38.700]   Don't ever be so proud to think you are ever
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:43.260]   suffering like Job unless you're confident that you're
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:47.460]   completely blameless and upright like Job.
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:50.060]   So Job's suffering is unique.
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:50.860]   Verse 2.
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:53.740]   "Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:58.300]   His possessions also were 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels,
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:01.380]   500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys,
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:02.940]   and very many servants.
[00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:09.860]   And that man was the greatest of all the men of the east."
[00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:12.740]   So we see that Job is a righteous man.
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:16.940]   Job 1.1 describes him as one who was blameless, upright,
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:19.900]   fearing God, and turning away from evil.
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.180]   So we see that he has seven sons, three daughters,
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:29.300]   11,000 animals, and very many servants.
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:33.340]   So it's almost countless number of servants that he has.
[00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:34.900]   Countless.
[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:37.340]   But he's going to be left with only four.
[00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:41.700]   Now I want to read down chapter 1, verse 6 to 9.
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:43.580]   "Now there was a day when the sons of God
[00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:45.980]   came to present themselves before the Lord,
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:48.500]   and Satan also came among them.
[00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:52.780]   The Lord said to Satan, 'From where do you come?'
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:54.780]   Then Satan answered the Lord and said,
[00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:58.220]   'From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.'
[00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:02.260]   The Lord said to Satan, 'Have you considered my servant Job?
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:05.540]   For there is no one like him on the earth,
[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:07.980]   a blameless and upright man, fearing God
[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:09.980]   and turning away from evil.'
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:11.800]   And then Satan answered the Lord,
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.820]   'Does Job fear God for nothing?
[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:18.620]   Duh, you've blessed him.'"
[00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:21.700]   And we see that Satan, the accuser,
[00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:24.340]   comes into the presence of the Lord.
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.100]   And what this text reveals to me is
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:32.660]   that there is great delight and joy when God describes Job.
[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:34.420]   Did you guys see this?
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:37.220]   He's proud of Job.
[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:40.820]   I almost want to read it like, "This is my beloved servant
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:44.860]   Job, in whom I am well pleased.
[00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:45.820]   Look at him."
[00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:54.640]   Then Satan asks permission to tempt Job by ruining his life.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:57:00.580]   And unbeknownst to Job, God approves.
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:04.900]   Job 1 verse 12, "Then the Lord said to Satan, 'Behold,
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:07.900]   all that he has is in your power.
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:10.980]   Only do not put forth your hand on him.'
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:14.420]   So Satan departed from the presence of the Lord.
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:18.740]   And on one single day, the following things happen.
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:20.540]   A group called the Sabaeans slaughter
[00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:22.820]   all of Job's many servants with a sword.
[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:25.180]   They leave one alive.
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:28.600]   They take all 500 oxen, 500 female donkeys.
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:30.860]   And at the same time, the Chaldeans come.
[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:32.820]   They slaughter all the rest of his servants.
[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:34.620]   They take 3,000 of his camels.
[00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:36.940]   They, too, leave one single man alive.
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:40.300]   At the same time, a great wind comes from the wilderness,
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:43.540]   blows a large house into the air,
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:47.260]   and drops it on all his kids while they're having a party.
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:49.620]   So all seven sons and three daughters
[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:54.020]   and all of their young friends wiped out.
[00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:56.340]   And what is called the fire of God, which is actually
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:58:00.100]   the fire that Satan wielded, burns up
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:04.740]   all the rest of the servants who are watching the 7,000 sheep,
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:07.300]   and they leave one.
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:11.260]   So on one day, Job loses all of his wealth.
[00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:15.940]   He loses all of his servants, with the exception of four.
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:21.540]   And remember, Job is a righteous man and a righteous boss.
[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:26.980]   And righteous bosses are very careful to tend
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:29.180]   to their people.
[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:30.320]   They're all dead.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.980]   He probably knew them by name.
[00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:34.380]   He probably cared for them, loved them,
[00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:36.580]   gave them provisions, all dead.
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:45.060]   And then he lost every single one of his 10 children,
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:48.180]   horrible in and of itself, and all their friends,
[00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:52.980]   whom he probably loved as well, whose parents were
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:55.380]   his friends, probably.
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:59:00.460]   So he has to face the accusation, because of you,
[00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:02.960]   our kids are all dead.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:04.460]   And he has no explanation.
[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:06.740]   He has no defense.
[00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:15.380]   So imagine the overwhelming grief, the guilt, the pain.
[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:20.900]   The money being gone is nothing compared to everything else.
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:22.660]   And it says at the end of the first day,
[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:24.260]   we looked at that passage earlier,
[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:28.580]   that Job fell to the ground and worshiped and did not
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:31.380]   sin or blame God.
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:35.340]   Strike one, Satan, he failed.
[00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:37.640]   He failed in his efforts to tempt Job.
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.800]   And then we get to chapter 2.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:43.220]   Satan asked permission a second time.
[00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:45.880]   And again, unbeknownst to Job, God
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:51.080]   gives Satan permission to mess with even Job's body
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:53.120]   and his health.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:57.000]   And the only thing, the only rule that Satan has to follow
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.880]   is to not go all the way and kill him.
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:02.960]   Job 2, 6 to 7, so the Lord said to Satan,
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.860]   behold, he is in your power.
[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:07.920]   Only spare his life.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:09.960]   Then Satan went out from the presence of the Lord
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:13.840]   and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.880]   to the crown of his head.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.360]   Job chapter 2, verse 7, there are
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.480]   boils from the sole of his feet to the crown of his head.
[01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:25.960]   I looked up what a boil was, because I've never had one.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:30.320]   A boil is a very painful, pus-filled bump
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.200]   that forms under the skin when bacteria
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.800]   infect and inflame one or more of the hair follicles.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.680]   You guys track it?
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:44.160]   The average human body has 5 million hair follicles.
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:50.880]   Oh, Job got messed up.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.040]   Job is suffering.
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:01:00.280]   His is a holistic suffering, physical, social, emotional,
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:05.880]   financial, marital, and probably spiritually,
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:09.620]   he had tons of questions.
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:13.720]   And though he does not sin, Job asks
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:17.360]   many chapters worth of questions that
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:19.100]   have since been posed by humanity
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:21.200]   for centuries upon centuries.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:27.320]   How can a good God allow for the suffering of those he loves?
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:30.600]   Have you guys heard people ask that before?
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.640]   Job asks, and God never gives an answer.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:41.240]   Very important question.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:47.240]   Job does not get an answer from the God who delights in him.
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:54.640]   Chapters 38 to 41, God actually shows up and rebukes
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:58.240]   and silences Job.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.960]   Who is this that darkens my counsel
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.240]   with words without knowledge?
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:04.240]   Where were you when I laid the foundations of the world?
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:08.920]   Tell me if you have knowledge.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.840]   And Job is never made aware of the fact
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:14.080]   that the primary reason for his suffering
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.600]   was God's delight in him.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:23.080]   The primary reason for Job's suffering
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:26.480]   was God's delight in him.
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:31.400]   He is never told that all hell on earth broke loose
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:33.840]   into his life, not because of sin,
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:39.520]   not because of unrighteousness, but because he was righteous.
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:42.680]   Because there was no one like him on the earth,
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:44.920]   a blameless and upright man, fearing God
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.920]   and turning away from evil.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:49.840]   So as far as we know, Job is never
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:54.560]   told of Satan's requests, never told of his activities.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:58.560]   But one thing we do know is Satan,
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:03.520]   the current prince of the world, has to ask permission.
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:07.760]   He has always had to ask for permission.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.200]   Luke chapter 22, in the New Testament,
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.320]   Jesus tells Peter that Satan has asked permission
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.640]   to sift the disciples like wheat.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.080]   You guys know this passage?
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:24.560]   It reads, "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded permission
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:25.760]   to sift you like wheat.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.960]   But I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail.
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:31.600]   And you, once you have turned again,
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.240]   strengthen your brothers."
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.800]   So to sift like wheat means to shake someone apart,
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:41.480]   to break someone down, to irreversibly injure.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:44.800]   And what's very insightful here is that the "you" in verse 31
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:47.400]   is in the plural.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.920]   The rest of the "you's" are all in the singular.
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:55.320]   So Satan has demanded permission to sift you all,
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:59.880]   all the apostles, all you disciples, like wheat.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:05.320]   But Jesus says, "I have prayed for you," singular Peter,
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:08.240]   in regard to whatever Satan had wanted to unleash on Peter
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.080]   to dissuade or to harm Peter,
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:16.200]   to cause Peter to be just like Judas, Jesus said, "No."
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.200]   And that "but" at the beginning of verse 32
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:21.800]   is a very important and operative word.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:25.400]   There are things that take place in our lives and in our world
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:29.200]   because Satan temporarily is maneuvering behind the scenes.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.840]   And that should not come as a surprise.
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.120]   Ephesians chapter 6 tells us that our struggle
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.920]   is not against flesh and blood,
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:41.080]   but against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:43.480]   But for us who have put our faith in Christ Jesus,
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.920]   we have confidence in a few things, right?
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.560]   We learn from scriptures like Romans 8
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.600]   that there is no condemnation now
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.400]   for us who are in Christ Jesus.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.120]   Nothing can separate us from the love of God.
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:57.200]   You are eternally secure
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:00.760]   if you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:03.880]   Amen?
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:06.280]   Tribulation, or distress, or persecution,
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:09.880]   or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:16.120]   may and will be ordained for your life here.
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.080]   For all who want to live a godly life in Christ Jesus
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.680]   will be persecuted.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:26.200]   Try not to run away from that.
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:34.360]   But if you are in Christ, if you persevere in his grace,
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:37.200]   you are going to hear, "Well done,
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:42.320]   my good and faithful suffering servant."
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.440]   This brings us to our third point,
[01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:48.280]   the acceptance of a servant.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:51.080]   Job 42.8, "Now, therefore, take for yourself
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.560]   seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job,
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.160]   and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves.
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.920]   And my servant Job will pray for you,
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.400]   for I will accept him,
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:04.880]   so that I might not do with you according to your folly,
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.840]   because you have not spoken to me what is right,
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:09.120]   as my servant Job has."
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.520]   So Eliphaz, the Temanite, Bildad, the Shuhite,
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:14.920]   Zophar, the Naamathite, went and did as the Lord told them,
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:18.040]   and the Lord accepted Job.
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.640]   So God tells Job's three friends
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:22.760]   to offer a sacrifice of seven bulls and seven rams.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.920]   And the only other place we see this in the scriptures
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:28.280]   is Numbers 23 by Balaam, the false prophet.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:30.320]   So this may have been some kind of traditional
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.280]   burnt offering for sin,
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:39.280]   but God commands them to go and receive prayer from Job.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.480]   Now, we see this sort of thing
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.640]   in other parts of the Old Testament.
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:45.240]   But Job's three friends are told to go
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.120]   and receive prayer from Job, and from the text,
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:54.400]   it appears that they were to go to Job for God's forgiveness,
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:57.520]   not so much for any kind of healing.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:01.960]   And Job is functioning like a priest here.
[01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:07.360]   The prayers of Job, the righteous man,
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.760]   would be powerful and effective
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:14.640]   for the forgiveness of their sins.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:17.400]   This is fascinating.
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:20.120]   I find Job to be one of the most Christ-like figures
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:23.120]   in the Old Testament.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:26.680]   Job was God's beloved, accepted servant.
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.640]   He is blameless and upright.
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.200]   He suffers in every way imaginable.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.880]   He is made an example.
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.000]   He is afflicted.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.400]   He is misunderstood.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.240]   And like the suffering Messiah,
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:40.040]   Job, too, is esteemed by those around him
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:43.960]   as stricken, smitten of God, afflicted.
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:46.800]   And what's fascinating is that, like Christ,
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.520]   our great high priest,
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:52.480]   Job's intercession leads to the forgiveness
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:57.040]   of these blasphemers and the heretics.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.080]   It's fascinating, because even in the text,
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.520]   it doesn't say God receives Job's prayers.
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:05.240]   Your ESV and your NIV says God accepts Job's prayers,
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:07.000]   but the word "prayer" is not attached
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.320]   to those words in the original language.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.640]   So if you look at the NASB or the LSB,
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.880]   it just says God accepts Job.
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.640]   Fascinating stuff.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:17.080]   So what are we supposed to take home
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:18.120]   from what we're seeing here?
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:21.000]   What are we supposed to make of this?
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.680]   Well, first, if you feel like you can relate more to Job
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.040]   than to his three friends,
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.840]   I want to rebuke you for your pride.
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:32.480]   You and I are way more like Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.640]   than we are like Job.
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.200]   Amen?
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.240]   All right.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:39.320]   We resemble those three dumb, flawed men
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:42.920]   more than this righteous, suffering servant.
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:47.800]   So how do we respond?
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:51.480]   Well, first, when we encounter God's truths,
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:53.200]   even in our seasons of great suffering,
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.040]   we need to respond like Job did.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:00.320]   I want to point your attention to Job 42, 1 through 6.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:04.920]   Then Job answered the Lord and said,
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.920]   "I know that you can do all things
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:09.320]   "and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted.
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:13.960]   "Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?"
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.320]   And he's quoting God.
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:19.280]   "Therefore, I have declared that which I did not understand,
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:22.800]   "things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.480]   "Hear now and I will speak.
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:27.400]   "I will ask you and you instruct me.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:31.360]   "I have heard of you by the hearing of the ear,
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:34.680]   "but now my eye sees you.
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:40.920]   "Therefore, I retract and I repent in dust and ashes."
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:45.880]   So the only appropriate application is repent,
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:48.520]   worship, and trust.
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:55.400]   The world has no answer or explanation to a Christian's joy
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.120]   in the midst of great suffering.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:01.600]   God wastes nothing.
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:07.080]   He ordains all things either for your sanctification
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.800]   or for the sanctification of others.
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:14.800]   In other words, God ordains all things either for good
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.520]   or for your good.
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:22.040]   Perhaps God is using your life.
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:29.960]   Repent, worship, trust, intercede.
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:35.440]   And I'll leave you with a passage
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.000]   that is very full of application.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.520]   It comes from James 5:10-16.
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:47.640]   "As an example, brethren, of suffering and patience,
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:50.320]   "take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:53.600]   "We count those blessed who endured.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.600]   "You have heard of the endurance of Job
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.680]   "and have seen the outcome of the Lord's dealings,
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:02.640]   "that the Lord is full of compassion and is merciful.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:05.600]   "But above all, my brethren, do not swear
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.280]   "either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath,
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:10.820]   "but your yes is to be yes and your no, no,
[01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:12.880]   "so that you may not fall under judgment.
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:15.920]   "Is anyone of you suffering?
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:18.760]   "Then he must pray.
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:20.540]   "Is anyone cheerful?
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:22.720]   "He is to sing praises.
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:25.640]   "Is anyone among you sick?
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.520]   "Then he must call for the elders of the church
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.380]   "and they are to pray over him,
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:32.700]   "anointing him with the oil in the name of the Lord.
[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:34.160]   "And the prayer offered in faith
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:36.720]   "will restore the one who is sick,
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:38.360]   "and the Lord will raise him up,
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.220]   "and if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him.
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:45.480]   "Therefore, confess your sins to one another
[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:48.080]   "and pray for one another so that you may be healed.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:52.340]   "The effective prayer of a righteous man
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:53.860]   "can accomplish much."
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:57.380]   Fascinating stuff.
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:59.480]   In the beginning of the book, it says,
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:01.040]   "Consider it all joy, my brothers,
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.380]   "when you encounter various trials,
[01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:04.400]   "because you know that the testing of your faith
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.660]   "produces endurance."
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:12.300]   If the Lord has ordained suffering in your life,
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:16.600]   it may actually be so that he will use you
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:22.240]   to minister to other people through your worship.
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:26.520]   Trust him.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:31.060]   And when others around you suffer,
[01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:37.840]   proclaim his truths and move them to trust him as well.
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.360]   Amen?
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.360]   Let's pray together.
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:46.500]   Lord, I thank you for just your word,
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:50.980]   for your examples that you give us in your book.
[01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:57.300]   You are God in heaven, we are on earth.
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:02.300]   Lord, help our words just to be few
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:07.940]   and cause us to worship in spirit and in truth.
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:14.780]   Spirit and in truth, no matter how uncomfortable at times
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:16.300]   that truth may feel.
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:23.300]   You are holy, you are the potter, we are but the clay.
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:28.720]   Do with us, as you will, for your glory,
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:31.680]   for we know that when you are glorified and magnified,
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:35.340]   we joyfully celebrate with you.
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:37.840]   We thank you, Lord, for this morning
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.240]   and pray this in Jesus' name.
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:43.340]   Let us stand together for the closing praise.
