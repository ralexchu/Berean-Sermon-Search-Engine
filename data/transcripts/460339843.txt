[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.960]   >> So this I say and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.960]   the Gentiles also walk in the futility of their mind, being darkened in their
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.960]   understanding, excluded from the life of God because of hindrance that is in them,
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.960]   because of the hardness of their heart.

[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.960]   >> Nicodemus was amazed at the work of God,
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.960]   but Jesus says to him, the work of God must be done inside of you.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.960]   Don't just be amazed at the supernatural.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.960]   Any person could be amazed at the supernatural, what they see, hear.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.960]   >> That being said, we're talking about the new birth, and it's something that I've
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.960]   been thinking about a lot, especially doing youth ministry, and maybe you too
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.960]   have been thinking about what new birth is and what new birth looks like.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.960]   But before we begin our time of going into God's word, let me pray for us.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.960]   I'm so excited to bless our time.
