[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.040]   Let me begin by asking you guys this question, okay,
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.440]   to help you guys get in the frame of the sermon for today.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.980]   Is what is the best and greatest reward
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.340]   you have ever received, okay?
[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.440]   The best and the greatest reward you have ever received.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.420]   I'm not talking about a birthday present,
[00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.520]   that's something you just got,
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.640]   even though you didn't deserve anything,
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.280]   it's just 'cause you were born, you know?
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.080]   But something that you actually kind of worked for,
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.800]   but it was a bigger reward than you had imagined.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.280]   A greater reward than you had imagined, okay?
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.080]   Can you think of something like that?
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.120]   Maybe you were pushing really hard for a test,
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.120]   you thought you might get a B,
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.960]   but you got an A plus or something like that, I don't know.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.040]   Maybe you were working for a promotion,
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.160]   but you didn't just get a promotion,
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.760]   you got a bigger office, I don't know,
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.440]   think of something that you might have gotten, okay?
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.160]   You got that in your mind?
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.760]   All right, so that's great, that great reward.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.880]   If you wouldn't mind, you could share it
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.720]   with the person next to you,
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.280]   just don't rub it in too much, okay?
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.240]   But you wanna share it with the person next to you, yes?
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.440]   No, okay, okay, gotcha.
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.600]   This is a quiet bunch too.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.720]   But they're laughing a little bit more
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.080]   than the first bunch, right?
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.080]   Okay, whatever that reward you received, right?
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.640]   I wanna let you know that God wants to bless you
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.400]   and reward you more than you can ever imagine.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.280]   And I'll prove it to you by just what the word of God says.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.800]   Do you believe that God wants to reward you
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.400]   and bless you more than you can even imagine?
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.660]   Do you believe this?
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.080]   Because if you do, then it will alter
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.320]   and it will change and transform the way you live your life
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.920]   and what you live your life for.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.400]   You know, if we live our life for rewards on this world,
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.240]   what do you get?
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.880]   You get something temporary, right?
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.720]   You use your credit card to get some credit card
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.560]   reward points, what do you get?
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.780]   Maybe a free ticket.
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.520]   But when you live for God and you know
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.440]   that he wants to reward you greatly,
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.000]   then that will begin to change the way you look at God
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.840]   and also the way you live your life.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.200]   And so that's what we're gonna be talking about today.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.200]   So let's look at the Luke 19, verse 11 through 27, okay?
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.560]   Luke 19, verse 11 through 27, okay?
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.720]   I'll wait till you guys all get there.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.600]   I'm reading from the ESV, the English Standard Version, okay?
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.000]   As they heard these things, okay,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.480]   we'll get back to that part,
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.400]   he, Jesus, proceeded to tell a parable
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.720]   because he was near to Jerusalem
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.480]   and because they supposed that the kingdom of God
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.560]   was to appear immediately.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.400]   He said, "Therefore, a noble man went into a far country
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.400]   "to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.080]   "Calling 10 of his servants,
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.580]   "he gave them 10 minas and said to them,
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.240]   "Engage in business until I come."
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.200]   Everyone say engage.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.640]   - Engage. - Thank you.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.140]   "But his citizens hated him
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.660]   "and sent a delegation after him saying,
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.040]   "We don't want this man to reign over us.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.120]   "When he returned, having received the kingdom,
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.000]   "he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.120]   "be called to him that he might know
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.700]   "what they had gained by doing business.
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.260]   "The first came before him saying,
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.260]   "Lord, your mina has made 10 minas more.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.300]   "And he said to him, well done, good servant.
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.780]   "Because you have been faithful in a very little,
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.920]   "you shall have very little more."
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.840]   Oh, I'm sorry, that's not what it says,
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.200]   I'm sorry about that.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.020]   "Because you have been faithful in a very little,
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.980]   "you shall have authority over 10 cities.
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.480]   "And the second came saying,
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.300]   "Lord, your mina has made five minas.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.300]   "And he said to him, and you are to be over five cities.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.520]   "Then another came saying,
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.640]   "Lord, here is your mina,
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.100]   "which I kept laid away in a handkerchief.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.580]   "For I was afraid of you because you are a severe man.
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.340]   "You take what you did not deposit
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.440]   "and reap what you did not sow.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.580]   "He said to him, I will condemn you with your own words,
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.000]   "you wicked servant.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.040]   "You knew that I was a severe man,
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.360]   "taking what I did not deposit
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.200]   "and reaping what I did not sow.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.840]   "Why then did you not put my money in the bank?
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.020]   "And at my coming, I might have collected it with interest.
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.020]   "And he said to those who stood by,
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.720]   "take the mina from him
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.280]   "and give it to the one who has 10 minas.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.640]   "And they said to him, Lord, he has 10 minas.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.960]   "I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.520]   "But from the one who has not,
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.120]   "even what he has will be taken away.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.160]   "But as for these enemies of mine
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.320]   "who did not want me to reign over them,
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.760]   "bring them here and slaughter them before me."
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.920]   The word of God to us today.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.220]   Please take a moment to look at that yourself.
[00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.360]   Try to picture it.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.740]   Imagine, feel the tension,
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.760]   the joy, the elation, all these things,
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.220]   the fear, all that stuff.
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.580]   Okay?
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.260]   And now let's just take a moment to pray
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.580]   as we enter into the word of God.
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.460]   Heavenly Father, thank you for your love.
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.860]   Thank you that as you look upon your sons and daughters,
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.140]   you absolutely adore them.
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.820]   In fact, you love them so much
[00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.580]   that you gave your only son for them.
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.300]   Is there anything that you would not provide for their needs?
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.500]   Lord, you are so good, you are generous.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.760]   Every good and perfect gift comes from you.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.820]   And I pray that today, Lord, as we look into your word,
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.580]   and once again, remind it,
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.740]   that Lord, as we live our life,
[00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.300]   that we would live it knowing
[00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.020]   that you alone are worthy of our praise,
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.980]   you alone are worthy of all of our life,
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.220]   and God, that you are a good and generous God.
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.020]   We love you, we serve you today.
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.340]   We pray that you would fill us with your spirit and guide us.
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.880]   We ask this in Jesus' name, amen, amen.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.860]   So I think that as we look at this parable,
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.380]   it's kind of clear, right?
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.820]   Let me, can we do some interaction, is that okay?
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.260]   You guys can respond to me, okay?
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.500]   If you're wrong, I'm not gonna go, "Eh," get out.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.940]   I'm not gonna do that kind of stuff.
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.860]   But I would like some interaction, okay?
[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.000]   So who is the nobleman in this story?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.820]   Jesus, very good, right?
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.020]   He's a nobleman who goes off,
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.820]   I thought I heard someone say Jesus.
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.740]   Okay, and he's the nobleman who goes off
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.900]   to a distant country to become king.
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.780]   That means we don't know how long he's going to be away.
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.260]   Okay, currently, he's been away for over 2,000 years.
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.480]   He goes away.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.580]   Also, what else do we see in this passage?
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.060]   That he has given his servants one mina each.
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.140]   A mina is worth three months' wages, okay?
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.540]   So he gives each of his 10 servants one mina each.
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.820]   While he is away receiving his kingdom,
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.740]   there will also be haters,
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.380]   people who don't want Jesus to be king.
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.980]   And we see that all the time around us, right?
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.580]   Sometimes even in our own life,
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.900]   we don't want Jesus to be king.
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.340]   We want ourselves to be king or queen in that sense, right?
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.540]   But Jesus is coming back as king,
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.980]   and when he comes back, he's gonna call everybody,
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.780]   his servants, to give account for their life,
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.700]   for what they've done with the mina,
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.540]   as well as the enemies who opposed him,
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.620]   he will call them to give account, okay?
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.860]   So that's pretty much what the parable is saying.
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.940]   Now, what Jesus has done is he has given us, actually,
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.940]   a future parable of what the framework of our life
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.540]   is going to look like, okay?
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.380]   So here we go.
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.620]   Let's imagine this is the picture frame.
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.980]   Slide number one.
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:38.860]   Ding!
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:39.700]   Wonderful.
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.700]   (audience laughs)
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.060]   So the picture frame at the top,
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.820]   Jesus is king, or going away to be king,
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.900]   and as he left, he gives us minas, his servants,
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.380]   but also there are haters.
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.300]   So this could be this side, right?
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.260]   Jesus is coming back.
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.660]   We do not know when, but he is coming back.
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.660]   And lastly, when he comes back,
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.100]   he will call us to give account for our life.
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.500]   This is the framework of our life.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.620]   There's nothing you could do about it.
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.260]   You cannot change this.
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.420]   You cannot stop Jesus from becoming king.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.780]   You cannot deny that he's given you minas.
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.300]   You cannot stop haters in this world.
[00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.620]   There's always gonna be haters.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.980]   You cannot stop him from coming back.
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.980]   One day he's gonna come back,
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.660]   and nothing you can do can stop it,
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.340]   and when he does come back, we'll all give account.
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.580]   So the only thing that's missing
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.860]   from this picture frame is what?
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:25.700]   Ding!
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.540]   Ding!
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.140]   The picture of what your life is going to look like.
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.380]   Of what your life will be about.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.660]   That is the only thing that is missing from this frame.
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.460]   Everything else, you cannot do anything about it.
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.220]   It is already set this way.
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.220]   But how you will live your life.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.060]   What will be the picture of your life?
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.980]   So let's go back to the passage now, okay?
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.740]   This begins by, "As they heard these things,"
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.060]   and so it's a connector from verse 10, right, and on.
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.660]   Who are the they that heard?
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.860]   Who are the they?
[00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.260]   The they are not just his 12 disciples.
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.780]   The they are literally thousands,
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:09.260]   if not 10,000 people that are crowded around Jesus.
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.020]   They have watched Jesus raise the dead.
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.220]   They have watched Jesus heal the sick,
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.900]   cast out demons, feed the multitude
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.860]   with five loaves and two fishes.
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.980]   And they are in this frenzy, this euphoria.
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.420]   They are following Jesus because they believe
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:31.420]   that Jesus fits the exact model of the Old Testament prophets
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.140]   that are prophesied of the Messiah.
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.420]   They look at Jesus and they say,
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.860]   "If there's gonna be anyone who's gonna be Messiah,
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.980]   "it's Jesus."
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.780]   And so there are literally thousands,
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.460]   if not tens of thousands, that are following Jesus
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.220]   on his way to Jerusalem.
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.660]   Verse Luke 18, he was going through Jericho.
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.780]   As he was going through Jericho,
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.860]   there was a blind man by the name of Bartimaeus.
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.740]   Cries out, "Son of David, have mercy on me."
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.060]   What does Jesus do?
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.260]   Gives the man sight.
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.100]   Crowd gets even more frenzied, more excited.
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.420]   He's walking through Jericho.
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.860]   Remember he sees a small guy, what was his name?
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.180]   Zacchaeus, right, the chief tax collector.
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.740]   The one that is hated by the other Jewish people
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.700]   because he's considered a traitor.
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.340]   What does Zacchaeus do when he encounters Jesus?
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.380]   He says, "Look, Lord, right here and now,
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.820]   "I give half my wealth to the poor,
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.620]   "and anyone I cheated, I will pay back four times."
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.100]   He is returning the hearts of the traitors
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.340]   back to the heart of God in that sense.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.540]   So they're like, "Jesus is unstoppable.
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.660]   "He's going to Jerusalem.
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.940]   "He's going to establish the kingdom of Israel."
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.500]   And they're pumped.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.700]   But this is the thing.
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.440]   Jesus is not going to Jerusalem
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.420]   to establish a political kingdom.
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.420]   In fact, he tried so hard for those three years
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.440]   to do ministry in like these little towns,
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.540]   like Capernaum and Galilee, where he would be unknown,
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.500]   but it just continued to spread.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.080]   Because in Luke 19, verse 10, he says this,
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.740]   "The Son of Man came to seek and save the lost.
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.140]   "That's why I came.
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.040]   "I came to do the salvation work
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.200]   "before I build my kingdom.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.580]   "I've come to save lives, to lead people back to Christ,
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.780]   "back to me, to salvation,
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:19.780]   "before I establish my kingdom," in that sense.
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.740]   And so he's saying the first time he's come,
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.380]   he's come as savior.
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.460]   But when he returns, he's going to come back as king
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.500]   and as judge.
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.900]   Now, the thing is this, even though he's telling them this,
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.220]   even though he's saying this to the people,
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.500]   they don't get it.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.740]   Especially the disciples, they don't get it.
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.080]   They're like, "Jesus, when we get to Jerusalem,
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:38.920]   "can I sit on your right?
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.040]   "And can I sit on your left?"
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.320]   And they're arguing about this.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.860]   Because their whole thought is this,
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.240]   "Jesus, we are sick and tired
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.400]   "of the Roman government oppressing us.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.780]   "We are sick and tired of the pagan Roman worship.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.720]   "We are sick and tired of all these idols
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.680]   "that are set up around us.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.360]   "We are sick and tired of all our fellow Jewish people
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.480]   "just falling away.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.320]   "We want you to make Israel great again.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.860]   "Make America great again.
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.880]   "And we want you to do it now,
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.920]   "like I said, immediately."
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:20.020]   But Jesus is saying, "No, that's not why I came for.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.240]   "I did not come to establish a political kingdom.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.040]   "I did not come to become a political king.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.240]   "I came to seek and save the lost.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.800]   "When I come back, then there will be,
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.440]   "the eternal kingdom will be established."
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.860]   So we need to think about this,
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.800]   because I think many of us,
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.800]   we're kind of in the same attitude as the disciples.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.360]   Oh Jesus, I'm sick and tired of these laws.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.160]   I'm sick and tired of these transgender issues
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.960]   where guys can use the girls' bathroom.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.100]   I'm sick and tired of all, I'm sick and tired,
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.620]   God, either you come back now,
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.280]   or you stop all this and bring judgment,
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.940]   and this is the kind of, take me away.
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:04.500]   And so in a real sense, we are just like the disciples.
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.840]   I notice when I look at YouTube
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.080]   and I see a lot of the 666 or the end of the world,
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.400]   a lot of those YouTube clips, they come from America.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.080]   They don't come from other parts of the world.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.480]   They're kind of just going on.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.160]   It's the Christians in America.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.800]   Come back now, Jesus, get us out of here.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.360]   Rescue us, save us.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.560]   And Jesus is saying, "No, it's not time.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.480]   "The king is gonna go away for a while."
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.360]   And so he gives them this parable
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.080]   to help them to understand, okay?
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.060]   And the parable is the nobleman go off to a far country.
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.440]   We don't know how long,
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.880]   but there's two things Jesus is sure of,
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.360]   that he is gonna become king, and he's going to return.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.660]   And when he returns, every single person on this world
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.440]   will stand before him and give account.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.240]   And those who have been faithful,
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.080]   those who have been obedient, will receive a great reward.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.360]   But those who have not will face a great judgment,
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.120]   as we see here, right?
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.160]   It's all dependent on how we live.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.220]   He calls his 10 servants and he gives them one minna each,
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.560]   says, "Engage in business."
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.600]   Everyone say, "Engage."
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.220]   That word, engage, in the Greek is the word pragmatoumai,
[00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.720]   which is where we get the word pragmatic, right?
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.560]   Pragmatic.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:22.560]   It means to carry on business, to trade, to occupy.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.200]   The king, the nobleman is telling his servants,
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.320]   "Be active.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.800]   "Multiply the minna that was given to them."
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.480]   The command is simple, I think, and very clear.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.880]   What, as a servant, am I to do?
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.760]   Engage.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.960]   Engage in business.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.280]   It's hard, though, right?
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.240]   Because we look around and we go,
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.500]   "Oh man, there's so much crime.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.420]   "There's so much greed.
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.780]   "There's so much backstabbing.
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:48.620]   "I don't wanna engage.
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.660]   "I just wanna stay in a handkerchief.
[00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.440]   "I just wanna stay safe.
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.120]   "I just wanna protect myself."
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.640]   In fact, what happens is most of the people,
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.960]   if you look at the world,
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.320]   the population of the world is moving into cities.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.840]   And so God is saying, "I want you to engage in cities."
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.360]   And I live in Gangnam, which is ridiculously crowded.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.120]   If you haven't been to Korea, Seoul,
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.560]   it makes LA look like a countryside, really.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.680]   You get into a subway, people are crammed against you.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.840]   The first time I went to Korea,
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.880]   I sat down in the subway, I had no idea, okay?
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.260]   I had no idea, I'm from LA.
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.360]   I sit down, there's no such thing as personal space.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.760]   I sit down, and all of a sudden,
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.800]   this girl who's wearing a short skirt
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.320]   stands right between my legs.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.520]   And I'm just like, "What is going on here?"
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.600]   Personal space, you know?
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.920]   So when I encounter, you know,
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.800]   people are bumping, little ajummas are pushing me.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.000]   When I encounter that,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   I'm telling you, I don't want to engage.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.280]   I want to disengage and go off to some secluded area.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.680]   But Jesus said, "No, I want you to engage.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.880]   "I want you to engage."
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.240]   And he gives this parable, engage.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.560]   But the question then becomes,
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.840]   okay, it's clear what you want us to do,
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.720]   but what does he mean by engage?
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.560]   Right?
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.120]   Because, you know, that could be kind of nebulous.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.320]   What do you mean by engage?
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:07.360]   And secondly, maybe more importantly, how do we engage?
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.680]   Because I don't want you to just leave here
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.040]   and say, "Yeah, I have to engage, I have to engage,
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.400]   "but I don't really know how to."
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.560]   I want us to start thinking about how do we engage as well?
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.840]   So we are to engage, what does it mean,
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.960]   and how do we do it?
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.240]   So let's start by saying,
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.000]   by looking at what does it mean.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.840]   To engage, literally, it means to put my money to work.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.880]   Invest this for me while I'm gone.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.480]   Literally, word for word, Jesus is commanding
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.960]   that the money given to us,
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.320]   all of it, since it belongs to God,
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.440]   somehow we figure out how to multiply it
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.840]   and then give it back to God,
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.680]   the money back to God.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.880]   Now, to be sure, the Bible does talk about us
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.040]   being faithful stewards with God's money.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.360]   We know that's there.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.360]   But I think that most of us, if we look at this,
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.000]   we can figure out that it's not just talking about money.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.840]   Right?
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.680]   Right?
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.500]   It's not just about money.
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.340]   Do you believe that?
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.180]   Do you see that?
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.000]   Because if it's only about money,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:58.840]   some of you don't have money,
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.560]   so you go, "Well, this parable means nothing to me
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.400]   "'cause I have no money."
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.280]   So, no, of course not.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.200]   And a lot of the apostles didn't have money too, right?
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.760]   Silver and gold I do not have,
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.000]   but this I have in the name of Jesus,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.840]   stand up and walk, right?
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.680]   So, it means more than just money.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.320]   So, what could this mina from the king be?
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.240]   This is interaction time.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.400]   Can you guys give me something?
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.560]   What could the mina be?
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.560]   The gospel, very good.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.400]   What else?
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.280]   The gospel, very good.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.120]   What else?
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.160]   Was that like an echo?
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.000]   The gospel.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.680]   The gospel.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.500]   Anything else?
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.340]   (audience member speaking faintly)
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.180]   Huh?
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.000]   Abilities.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:35.840]   Abilities.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.760]   Spiritual gifts.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.840]   Spiritual gifts, very good.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.680]   Anything else?
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.800]   (audience member speaking faintly)
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.920]   Time, very good.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.520]   That's so precious to us, right?
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.360]   What else?
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.880]   (audience member speaking faintly)
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.040]   Talents, right?
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.920]   Holy Spirit, right?
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.240]   So many things.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.960]   And doing the research, going over commentaries,
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.000]   they all said these kind of things.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.360]   The gospel, some of the commentaries are gospel,
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.200]   some of the commentaries say talents,
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.800]   energy, spiritual gifts.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.920]   I think it's safe to say, though,
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.880]   the best way to do it is just life.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.240]   It's all of our life.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.960]   The King's Mina is all of our life
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.040]   since all of our life is a gift from God.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.600]   Our life is a gift from God given to us.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.600]   It will be the basis for our rewards.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.040]   So the command is to take all that you are,
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.320]   all that you are, that which the King has given to you,
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:28.040]   and then to occupy, to engage until he returns.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.520]   When we stand before God,
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.880]   God wants us to be able to say,
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.680]   Lord, Lord, the life you've given to me,
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.000]   I return it back to you,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.640]   and it's been multiplied 10 times, five times, whatever,
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.760]   and God wants to reward you.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.120]   Look at the person next to you and say,
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.360]   God wants to reward you.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.520]   Say that to each other.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.880]   That's right.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.080]   God wants to reward you.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:52.640]   So engage is to really start to do business,
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.760]   to interact, and it means to participate,
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:00.440]   to be involved, to enter into people's lives and interests,
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.320]   to get to know them is the understanding of engage,
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.280]   'cause you have to trade.
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.040]   In order to trade, you have to interact.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.280]   And you know what, Jesus is the true model,
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.920]   the supreme model of engaging.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.640]   He did it all the time.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.000]   In fact, he was the one who did it in the most real way.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.480]   Do you remember when Jesus was over
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.040]   at Simon the Pharisee's house?
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.760]   He went in, Simon didn't wash his feet,
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.280]   didn't do anything, didn't give him water to wash his hands,
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.360]   and Jesus is laying down and he's eating, and what happens?
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.160]   Remember, a woman walks in,
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.440]   a so-called sinner, probably a prostitute,
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.640]   and as she comes up to Jesus,
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.800]   she begins to weep, and her tears start to hit Jesus' feet,
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.080]   and the dirt begins to start to smudge,
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:39.920]   and then what does she do?
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.520]   She unties her hair, she begins to wipe his feet
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.240]   with her hair, and then pour the alabaster jar perfume,
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.920]   very expensive perfume, and what does Simon the Pharisee say?
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:52.800]   If Jesus knew who this woman was
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.120]   and what kind of a sinner she was,
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.860]   he wouldn't let her touch him.
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.440]   But this is the ironic thing.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.900]   Only Jesus really knew who this woman was.
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.460]   You see, we look up from the outside,
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.980]   from the superficial, but Jesus actually engages,
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.260]   he knows them, he goes, "Daughter, your faith has saved you.
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.820]   "Go in peace."
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.660]   And then along comes another time, he's walking,
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.460]   and along comes a rich young ruler, remember?
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.740]   He goes, "Good teacher, what must I do
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.220]   "to inherit eternal life?"
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.800]   And Jesus says, "Well, what does the law say?"
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.560]   "Well, I've kept all the law."
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.600]   So all the girls are like, "Oh."
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.740]   (audience laughs)
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.460]   Keeps all the law, is rich and young and good-looking.
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.300]   "Oh."
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.860]   And then Jesus looks at him, engages him,
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.460]   'cause he knows him, says, "That's one thing you lack.
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.020]   "Sell all you have, give it to the poor,
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.220]   "and then come follow me, and you'll have riches in heaven."
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.860]   And what does he do?
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.100]   Turns around and he leaves.
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:50.700]   You see, Jesus is the only one that truly engages people.
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.140]   He sees them as they really are.
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.620]   That's what Jesus wants us to do.
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.980]   He wants us to truly engage people,
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.020]   engage with your life, engage others.
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.540]   So this is the question.
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:06.820]   Do you engage, do you invest the life God has given to you,
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.340]   or do you try to escape?
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:12.960]   Do you try to hide or put it in a handkerchief?
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.460]   Now that was the word engage, what it means to engage.
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.700]   But how do we engage?
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.780]   How do we engage?
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.580]   That's the more important question, I think.
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.140]   Now let me start off by asking you this question.
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.660]   If Bill Gates gave you a large chunk of his money
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:32.260]   and said to you, "I want you to multiply this for me."
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.340]   Bill Gates gave you this chunk of money.
[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.060]   How would you treat that money that he gives to you?
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:44.020]   And how would you know how to multiply it as well?
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.660]   Would you know how to multiply it?
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.220]   Now this is the thing, Bill Gates is just a man,
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.780]   and that money he gives to you is just temporary.
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.580]   God has given you his very son, his very spirit,
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.620]   his very life, his God, he's given you.
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.500]   How do you treat what he has given to you,
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.300]   and do you know how to multiply it?
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.500]   And so I was thinking about this too,
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.020]   'cause I really want to be a good steward,
[00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.540]   I wanna be a good servant.
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:08.980]   If you wanna be a good servant in this place,
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.420]   raise up your hand, say, "Yes, I do."
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.260]   Yeah, amen, praise God, I'm speaking to you guys, great.
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.020]   So think about this, here are the 10 servants,
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.580]   they're lined up, and the king gives each one a mina.
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.060]   I want you to multiply this, engage in business,
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.380]   engage in business, engage.
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.100]   Now the moment the king gives them the money,
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.380]   what have they become?
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:30.780]   Stewards, yes, what else?
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.220]   Like, occupationally wise?
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.980]   Investors, right?
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.820]   They become investment bankers in that sense, right?
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.740]   So not only are they servants,
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.340]   they are now investment bankers.
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.300]   And so I started looking at this picture, this story,
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.460]   and I go, "Oh man, it would be great
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.980]   "if there was someone who was a professional
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.420]   "investment banker, and took this parable and taught it."
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.020]   So I said, "Okay, if God wants us to be investment banker,
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.660]   "then I better look up the five top qualities
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.380]   "of an investment banker."
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.660]   So that's what I did, I went on YouTube,
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.860]   I went on a bunch of different sites,
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.020]   click, click, click, click, top five qualities.
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:04.860]   I was shocked.
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.100]   I thought that the number one quality would be
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.580]   that they know where to invest,
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:10.780]   that's what I thought the number one would be.
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.900]   Wouldn't you think that would be
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.620]   a successful investment banker?
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:14.780]   This is what they all said.
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.300]   You can look it up yourself.
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.980]   Unanimously, they said this,
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:21.180]   "A good investment banker knows their client
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:23.300]   "and knows what their client wants."
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.660]   I was like, "Oh my gosh, that sounds like Christian."
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:33.300]   Second, good investment bankers give of themselves
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.980]   and take big risks for their clients.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:39.900]   Thirdly, good investment bankers sense
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.140]   where the investment will make the most impact.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.220]   That's what I thought would be number one,
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.940]   but it was actually like number three or number four.
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.220]   So really, a good investment banker
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.460]   has this relationship with their client.
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.540]   That's the most important thing.
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.180]   The client comes and says, "Here's my money,
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.060]   "I want you to multiply it."
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.220]   The good investment banker says,
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.080]   "I'm making my number one priority to get to know you.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.780]   "What do you want me to invest in?
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.000]   "How much return do you want?
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.900]   "Do you want a quick return or a slow, steady growth?"
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.140]   There is a sense where a good investment banker knows
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.580]   it's not my money, it's this client's,
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.700]   so I need to know this client.
[00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.860]   And what does the first servant say
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.580]   when he stands before the king?
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:23.820]   What does the first servant say?
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:28.820]   "Your mina has made 10 more."
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:33.060]   I'm so humbled by this servant,
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.180]   'cause you know what I say sometimes?
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.660]   I go, "My mina has made 10 more."
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.300]   But he says, "It's yours.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.140]   "Your mina has made 10 more."
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.940]   There is this humility, there is this absolute sense
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:50.580]   where he knows that it's all the king's.
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.940]   But there is a second principle that is so profound.
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.540]   He says, "Your mina has made 10 more."
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.020]   Do you know that the mina of God,
[00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.420]   what God has placed in you,
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.500]   whether it be His Spirit, whether it be the Gospel,
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.100]   whether it be the spiritual gifts,
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.260]   whether it be just your life,
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.660]   that if you just engage the promises,
[00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:12.000]   this is the principle, that it will just multiply itself.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.580]   Because God is powerful, God is almighty,
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.100]   like the seed of the Gospel.
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.500]   It has everything in there to produce fruit, to multiply.
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.460]   You just have to engage.
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.300]   This is the principle.
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.060]   "Your mina has made 10 more."
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.560]   There is this absolute sense.
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.100]   I need to know you, and it's all about you.
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.580]   Sometimes this is a struggle for me,
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.820]   because I go, "God, it's my mina,
[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.240]   "so I don't want to forgive.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.400]   "God, it's my mina, so I don't want to share.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.480]   "God, it's my mina, so I don't wanna give my time."
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.180]   I find myself doing that.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.380]   But not only that, sometimes I find myself going like this,
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:53.820]   "God, I need more minas, and then I could do something."
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.660]   But you know what?
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:58.380]   It's not about how I feel, or even what I think.
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.780]   It's about being obedient to the King,
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.440]   who said, "Engage with my mina."
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.000]   It's about obedience.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.200]   It's about being faithful.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.960]   One investment banker said this,
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.760]   "You become more valuable to the client
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.720]   "as they see you understanding their wants,
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.800]   "and working hard to get their investments multiplied.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:22.060]   "The client recognizes that you genuinely care about them,
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.860]   "and not just trying to make some money for yourself.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.500]   "You ask them if this investment
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.580]   "is acceptable to their portfolio.
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.220]   "If they say no, then you find something else.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.860]   "If they say yes, then you act upon it.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.700]   "Each step is taken side by side."
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:40.140]   So to engage in business, how do you do it?
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.000]   First, build your relationship with Christ.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.140]   Build your intimacy with God.
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.480]   Know His heartbeat, know His ways.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.280]   Know His words.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:56.320]   In this parable, of course, the client, or the investor,
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.760]   he is the nobleman, he is the King Jesus.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.360]   We are the servants.
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.800]   How well we know Christ, how closely we walk with Him,
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.360]   will determine how and what we invest in.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:10.800]   And Jesus, again, is a supreme example of the investor.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.440]   Because who is the client in his life?
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.200]   God, the Father, right?
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.960]   Jesus says, "I do nothing apart from my Father."
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.040]   Every morning, when everyone's sleeping,
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.640]   every afternoon, when people are doing ministry,
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.760]   whatever, busy, every night, when people go to sleep,
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.600]   what is Jesus doing?
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.760]   He is constantly engaging the Father,
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.520]   even starting from the age of 12.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:34.540]   And because He knows how to engage the client, the Father,
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.640]   what flows out of Him?
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.400]   Engaging the world, right?
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.120]   Engaging in His ministry.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.440]   That's the first thing.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.720]   So, really, our life, in our engagement,
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.160]   it should look like Christ.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.000]   That's what it should look like, the picture of our life.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.040]   Second, a good investment banker gives themselves
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.720]   to take big risks for their clients.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.320]   In other words, they work hard for their clients.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.200]   They are faithful to the very end.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.680]   The first thing a good investor does,
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.820]   and this is what they said, is,
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:03.740]   when they come early into work the next day,
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:06.080]   the first thing they do is they open up their portfolio
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.080]   and they go over the data, 'cause things change overnight.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.240]   And then they meditate upon it, they research it,
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.800]   they even for hours sometimes,
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.600]   and they act upon it after they research.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.760]   And I go, oh my gosh, this sounds like a Christian again.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:19.580]   Doesn't it?
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.480]   Because what is, we as followers of Christ,
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.400]   what are we supposed to do?
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.000]   Open up God's portfolio, look over His word,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   meditate upon it, see how we are to adjust our life
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.400]   according to His word, and then act upon it.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.580]   I go, oh my, this makes so much sense.
[00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.780]   That's why you're a good investor,
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.340]   because you know what's going on in the portfolio,
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.340]   you know what the word of God is saying in your life,
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.140]   and then you act upon it, and then you have to take risks.
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.100]   Because sometimes it's risky to say,
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.100]   hello, how you doing, to a stranger,
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.700]   because the word of God says, love your neighbor.
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.260]   Hey, you know, I have extra $5,
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.460]   but I just wanna bless you,
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.180]   because I feel like God wants me.
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:28:59.940]   It's risky.
[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.540]   I wanna forgive you, it's risky.
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.260]   But you act upon it, because you see it
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.940]   in the portfolio of God.
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:08.300]   And this is the thing,
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:11.160]   investment bankers, they never quit.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.000]   They don't call up their clients,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.460]   hey, I lost your money in this investment,
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:15.540]   I'm sorry, so I quit.
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.060]   They don't do that.
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:21.180]   It's only the client who says, no, you're fired, right?
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.820]   You can't quit, only I can fire you.
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.540]   But that's kind of what we do sometimes as Christians.
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:27.440]   God, I messed up again.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.680]   You should find somebody else, I quit.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.760]   And God's like, no, I didn't fire you.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.400]   Get back up, get back up.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.800]   I still have work for you.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.680]   Work with me, work with me.
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.200]   I want you to engage, right?
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.120]   Taking risks.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.320]   So, think about this now.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.680]   Here's servant number one, servant number two.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.980]   Servant number one makes 10 minutes more,
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.960]   five minutes more, and then the third servant.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.720]   So when servant number one and servant number two wakes up,
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.240]   how do they wake up?
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.240]   I know it doesn't say, but you imagine.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.640]   How do they wake up?
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.200]   This is kind of what I imagine.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:05.840]   My master has given me minas.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.520]   How can I multiply it today?
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.600]   And meditate, think about it, pray about it, whatever.
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:13.760]   Okay, they're excited.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.160]   They start to act upon their mina,
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.400]   upon what, you know, commander of them.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.720]   In a certain sense, they wake up with meaning.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.320]   They have meaning, they have purpose.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.520]   How does the third servant wake up?
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.520]   Oh gosh, I'm so tired, maybe a couple more hours.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.080]   (groans)
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:29.920]   Okay, let me get up.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.240]   Mm, I wonder what's for breakfast.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.360]   Who posted on Facebook?
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.120]   Anyone going to the mall today?
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.640]   Anyone going to the mall today?
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.680]   And looks over at the number one and number two guy,
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.540]   and servant's like, what are you guys doing?
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.040]   Why are you wasting your time?
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.400]   Come on, how long has this master been away for?
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.480]   2,000 plus years?
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.320]   Come on, he's not coming back.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.760]   You guys are stupid.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.440]   You weren't, just give it up, and just come live like me.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.280]   Come on, live it up, be free like me.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.640]   And because the third servant has this kind of attitude,
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.680]   he doesn't care about the master's mina,
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.200]   and he doesn't take risks.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.360]   In fact, what is his attitude like when the king does return?
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.800]   He goes like this, right, he goes,
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.000]   "Here's your mina.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.160]   "I kept it in a handkerchief
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.680]   "because I know you're a severe man.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.180]   "I know that you try to reap what you don't deposit."
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.440]   What is someone who tries to reap what they don't deposit?
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.480]   What are they called?
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.440]   A thief.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:31.600]   This third servant is calling the king a thief.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.160]   Could you imagine what servant number one, number two,
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.000]   are doing?
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.440]   They're looking at him, going,
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.940]   which king are you serving?
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.360]   My king is generous.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.520]   He gave me one mina.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.840]   It became 10, and I would have been happy
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.200]   if he just gave me 10 minas back.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.960]   In fact, I'm thankful that he even gave me a mina,
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.000]   but he gave me 10 cities.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.600]   Which king are you talking about?
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.000]   Something's wrong with you.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.800]   I think about this third servant.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.320]   Perhaps some of us are like this in this room.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.080]   Where we think that God is stingy.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.560]   Where we think that God takes away.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.880]   You know there's that song,
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.280]   ♪ Every blessing you pour out ♪
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.120]   You know that song?
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:13.960]   (audience laughs)
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.800]   And then there's that bridge, right?
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.440]   ♪ You give and take away ♪
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.800]   ♪ You give and take ♪
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.080]   You know that, right?
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:21.920]   This servant is saying,
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.440]   ♪ You take and take away ♪
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.280]   ♪ You take ♪
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.120]   You know?
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:26.940]   (audience laughs)
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:27.780]   But I thought about this.
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.320]   I really thought about this for a second, you know?
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.560]   Where in the Bible does God just take things away
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.520]   from his faithful servants arbitrarily?
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:36.000]   Nowhere.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.120]   Job says it.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.640]   That's where we get that stanza from.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.560]   But Job didn't know that it was actually Satan
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.400]   taking stuff away.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.920]   Yeah, God allowed it, yes, but it was Satan.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.840]   So in actuality, it's not even biblically right
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.720]   to say that he gives and takes away.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.040]   In fact, if you look at God, what does he always do?
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.200]   He gives and gives and gives.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.200]   He gave his son, he gives his Holy Spirit,
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.120]   he gives his word, he gives the body of Christ,
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.480]   he gives salvation, he gives us, he gives!
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:04.680]   But if you think that God is keeping something from you,
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:08.080]   he's stingy, then your heart becomes like this third servant
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.320]   you're a severe man.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.160]   First servant, second servant goes,
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.200]   "Are you kidding me?
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.120]   "He is abundantly generous.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.600]   "He gives, and now these two guys are excited.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.900]   "Hey, you wanna serve my king?
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.200]   "He's awesome, he gives!"
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:26.800]   More than you can ever imagine.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:31.360]   These three, these 10 servants, these three servants,
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.960]   they're all given the exact same minna.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.400]   And that means every single one of them
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.240]   have the exact same opportunity to see multiplication.
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.620]   So what is stopping them from multiplying?
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.840]   What is preventing them from multiplying?
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.680]   (water splashing)
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:53.780]   Nothing, except themselves.
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:56.780]   Do you hear me?
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.300]   What is stopping you from multiplying
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.700]   God's minna in your life?
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.740]   It's not God, God's not gonna stop you.
[00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.180]   He wants you to multiply.
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:06.220]   It's not Satan, Satan cannot stop you.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:10.980]   Only you can stop yourself from multiplying your minna.
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:14.740]   Only you can stop yourself from taking risks for God.
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:17.860]   Only you can stop yourself from pushing that extra hardness
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.700]   to get more of what God has for you.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:20.900]   Only you can stop that.
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:25.860]   The third servant, he was his own worst enemy.
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:29.300]   God wants you to multiply your minna.
[00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.940]   You know what, it really saddens me
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:32.660]   that in modern Western Christianity,
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:34.620]   which is what I'm part of as well,
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.460]   in modern Western Christianity, or should I say Churchianity,
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.420]   there is this attitude.
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.420]   And the attitude is like this, or this belief.
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.900]   Well, I said this in this prayer once,
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:47.500]   so now I'm saved, and I go to church on Sundays.
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.900]   So check, check, check, I'm good.
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.980]   Now I will live my life the way I wanna live it.
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.420]   In fact, why would I risk, take risk?
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.380]   Why would I try to work hard for God?
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:34:59.400]   Why, I'm in.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.740]   And there is a sense where we are living
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:05.820]   in such affluence and comfort that we just live like this.
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.100]   And what's kind of scary and saddens me
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.860]   is that the church, people in the church,
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.340]   our life starts to resemble a lot
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:16.140]   like the people of the world who don't serve God.
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.900]   And so this is an example of the picture,
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.300]   slide number three, please.
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:24.060]   So our life, this is what we're living for.
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:27.340]   Clothes, money, cars, house, you know?
[00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:30.260]   This is the picture that we want our life to look like,
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.260]   and it doesn't look any different
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.820]   than what the world looks like.
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:38.000]   But Jesus is telling us he wants us to engage in his kingdom.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.260]   Do we understand the price that was paid for our salvation?
[00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.940]   Are we truly grateful for the honor and the privilege
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.620]   of being a servant in his kingdom?
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.940]   If we do, then how can we just go on living
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.620]   like people of the world, pursuing the things of this world?
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.860]   No, we must be like the first and the second servant
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.540]   who are faithful, who are hardworking, who take risks,
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:03.420]   and who give everything for their king.
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:07.320]   The third thing of good investment bankers
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.740]   is they sense where the investments
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.620]   will make the most impact.
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.380]   At any given moment, you know, there are hundreds,
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.340]   maybe thousands of different possibilities to invest in,
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.280]   mutual funds, CDs, real estate, et cetera.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.380]   So what you have to do is you have to have a sense
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:26.980]   of where your master wants you to particularly invest in.
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:28.540]   You have to have the sense
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:30.480]   where you will make the most impact.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:35.740]   Remember, it's the same Nina, but it's a unique servant.
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.300]   Each of you are unique.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.180]   We all have one life to live.
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:42.020]   And we are to live the life that God has created
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.780]   and called us for.
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:44.700]   What has God called you for?
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:47.500]   So servant number one wakes up, this is what I enjoy doing.
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.020]   Let me use the Mina for God.
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.580]   This is, number two wakes up, this is what I enjoy doing.
[00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:51.780]   Let me leave it for God.
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:57.060]   You know, I've been a Christian now for 24 years,
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:59.400]   and there's one occupation that I didn't think
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.980]   could really be glorifying to God,
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.500]   and that's bodybuilding, okay?
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.500]   And please, you know, if you're a bodybuilder here,
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.340]   please don't get offended.
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:08.020]   You can hear the rest of the story, okay?
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.700]   Because, you know, you ever go to see,
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:10.980]   watch bodybuilding on TV,
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:11.900]   these guys come out and they're wearing
[00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.820]   like this thin, thin thong underwear, you know?
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.260]   And they turn around and you see their butt cheeks,
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.300]   I'm just like, how do you glorify God like that, you know?
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:20.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:21.620]   And then the girls, you know,
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.900]   they come out in this even thinner, you know,
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.140]   and go, oh boy, you know, I don't know.
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:27.980]   But what happened was, in Korea,
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.020]   there was this one lady, her name is Samantha.
[00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.620]   She's from the States, she's Caucasian,
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:32.900]   and she came to Korea to teach,
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:34.060]   just to make some extra money,
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:36.220]   and she became a bodybuilder, okay?
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.420]   And so she came to New Harvest,
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:38.260]   and she wasn't a Christian,
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.380]   and she became a Christian.
[00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.860]   And so she's just on fire for God,
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.260]   and she's like, you know,
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.180]   I feel like God really wants me to bodybuild.
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:47.140]   I go, can you do that, can you do that, you know?
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.220]   And then she like posts pictures up on her Facebook,
[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.460]   and I'm like, can I look at that?
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.300]   I don't know, you know?
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.540]   (audience laughing)
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:55.540]   So, anyway, but she's just on fire.
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.380]   Like, everywhere she goes,
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.460]   she's trying to encourage people.
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:58.300]   And so she's like, you know,
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.340]   how can I use my Mina for God?
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.180]   I was like, I have no idea.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.460]   I really don't.
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:04.860]   Let me flex your muscle, my Jesus,
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.820]   I don't know, what, you know?
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:09.180]   So then this is what happens, honestly.
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:10.140]   She tells me this, she goes,
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:11.580]   one day she's working out at the gym, right?
[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:13.260]   And she's preparing for a competition.
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.060]   And all of a sudden, she meets this one Korean lady
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:16.780]   who's actually preparing for the same thing
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.220]   as that competition.
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:19.060]   Now, one thing, I don't know,
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:21.180]   some of you, you know, Korean people may know this,
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:24.140]   but in Korea, there is this huge shame culture
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.140]   where all Korean women, they hate the way they look,
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:27.620]   they hate the way their body looks.
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:28.980]   So they're always doing plastic surgery, right?
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.060]   It's really sad.
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.500]   So anyway, they start talking,
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.100]   and then this Korean girl, the Korean lady,
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.980]   realizes that she's in the same competition,
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:38.060]   so she goes, oh, I cannot do the competition.
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.820]   You look too good, I go lose, you know?
[00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:41.660]   She goes like that, right?
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.460]   What, why are you guys laughing?
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.420]   I can do that, I'm Korean, I can do that, okay?
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:52.060]   So then this girl looks over,
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.620]   and this is what she says, Samantha,
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.620]   she goes, hey, I'm not your competition.
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:01.620]   Each of us, we do our best so that when we go up on stage,
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.660]   we present our best.
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:04.740]   You're your own competition.
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.060]   Don't compare.
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.860]   And I just thought, like, wow.
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:09.020]   And that lady, she got encouraged,
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:09.860]   and so she started working out, you know,
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:10.900]   and they're working out together,
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.460]   and I go, oh, I guess you can go
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.180]   if I got a bodybuilding, right?
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:16.580]   And this is what I realized, that she's absolutely right.
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:19.100]   Don't compare yourself to others.
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:21.300]   You are uniquely made for the way God made you.
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.420]   Don't compare, because if you compare yourself
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:25.580]   to somebody else, it will only lead to two things,
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.220]   either jealousy or arrogance.
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.780]   Look what they have.
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:31.700]   How come I don't have it?
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:32.840]   Jealousy.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.340]   Look what they have, and look what I got.
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.660]   Arrogance.
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:39.260]   If you're gonna compare, compare yourself to Jesus,
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:42.700]   and then you realize how much more you need of him.
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:46.500]   You have to live out the plan
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.060]   and the purpose God has created you for.
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:52.700]   Engage with the way God has made you.
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.800]   Now, how do you know how God has made you?
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.500]   I know for sure you cannot figure it out
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.100]   by putting yourself on a handkerchief.
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:01.980]   You ain't gonna figure that out.
[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:03.020]   What is a handkerchief?
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:03.980]   Handkerchief is this.
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.580]   Coming to church, sitting there,
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:06.620]   never talking to anybody,
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:08.540]   hearing the sermon, and then leaving.
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.340]   There is no way you're gonna figure out
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:11.340]   how to engage like that.
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.540]   There's no way, 'cause that's your handkerchief.
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:14.780]   I did my part, I'm out.
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:17.420]   There's no way you're going to figure out
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:19.060]   a sense of how you're supposed to invest
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.580]   if all you ever do is go to your office,
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:22.660]   lock the door, stay in your office.
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.500]   Wanna get some coffee?
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:24.340]   No, no, no, no, I'm too busy.
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.580]   I gotta work, I gotta work.
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:28.260]   You don't engage nobody.
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.700]   You're in your books all the time.
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:30.740]   I understand, some of you are students,
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:32.820]   so you have to study, I understand.
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.860]   But some of us, that's the way we just escape.
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.460]   That's the way we keep ourselves from engaging.
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:39.220]   There's no way you're going to know
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.660]   a sense of who you are, what God's called you for,
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.900]   if you're always escaping and hiding
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:45.860]   and being secluded by yourself.
[00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.900]   How do you learn the sense of who you are,
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:49.860]   of what God created you?
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.260]   That's why I love small groups.
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:52.100]   I love it.
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.140]   Because when you're in a small group,
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.140]   or when you're serving,
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.540]   and you start to interact with others,
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:57.780]   and all of a sudden someone comes up to you,
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:58.780]   goes, "Man, you know what?
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:01.740]   "I think you have a gift of hospitality."
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:02.580]   "I do?
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.820]   "How do you know?"
[00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.380]   "Because every time I'm around you,
[00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:08.780]   "you're so welcoming."
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:09.620]   "I am?"
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:12.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:13.780]   "I didn't know."
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:14.740]   "Yeah, of course you didn't know,
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.660]   "because you didn't engage."
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:17.780]   But then when you start to engage,
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:20.380]   all of a sudden people start to see and call you out.
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:21.940]   "Man, you have a gift of generosity."
[00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.500]   "I do?"
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:24.380]   "How do you know?"
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.940]   "Because everywhere you go, people are blessed
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:31.220]   "to become more abundant when you pass through."
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.060]   "I didn't know."
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:36.620]   "Yeah, because you never engaged."
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.780]   But when you engage and you interact,
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.940]   then you begin to start to see people start going,
[00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.740]   "Wow, there's something about you."
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:46.180]   There's a brother that was here in the first service,
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.700]   his name was Joseph.
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.340]   Man, he's got such a gift of hospitality.
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.780]   You need to put that brother on the welcoming team,
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:52.780]   because as soon as he walked in,
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:53.620]   he just looked at me and goes,
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:54.460]   "Hi, I'm Joseph."
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:55.820]   I was like, "Hey, bro, how are you?
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.700]   "I'm Doug, so great to see you."
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:58.700]   This is like gems, man.
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:00.300]   You gotta really encourage them.
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.260]   You know?
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.380]   How will you figure it out?
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.220]   You're not gonna figure it out
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.980]   by just sitting in front of a book in a cubicle.
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:09.100]   You have to continue to engage.
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:13.780]   Do you believe God has given you life?
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.140]   Do you believe that God has given you his son,
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:19.860]   his Holy Spirit, every good and perfect gift?
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:22.380]   And that means you have this treasure
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:23.940]   that he's given to you.
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:25.820]   Then what can you do with this life?
[00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:29.500]   What is the greatest impact that you can make today?
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.500]   Not in a couple of years when you have money
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:33.860]   or when you have a bigger position.
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.340]   Today, how can you make the greatest impact today?
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.620]   What is the greatest impact you can make today?
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:39.460]   What is it?
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.580]   You know the answer is?
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:45.140]   It's unlimited.
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.340]   It's unlimited.
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:51.300]   The impact that you can make today.
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:52.700]   You know, we do a thing in our church
[00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.060]   called discipleship training.
[00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:56.700]   This time, this term, we had nine sisters
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.940]   that went through nine months of discipleship training.
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:01.500]   The third month, every sister is required
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:02.940]   to start to disciple somebody else.
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.900]   Now some of them are really shy, so they didn't do it.
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.460]   I had this one sister named Minji, very shy girl.
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:08.900]   She's a professor at a school.
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.700]   And so she saw this one student and she just engaged him.
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:14.060]   She said, "Hey, would you like to do Bible study?"
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:15.700]   In Korea, you could still do those kind of things, right?
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:17.980]   In America, I know you get in big trouble.
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.380]   So she said, "Would you like to Bible study?"
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:20.500]   And the guy's like, "Sure."
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.500]   And he's not a Christian.
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.220]   They started doing Bible study, the Book of John.
[00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:26.940]   He liked it so much, he invited his friend.
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:27.780]   Became two.
[00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:29.220]   He liked it so much, they invited another friend.
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:30.060]   There's three of them.
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.540]   Now this guy is on the verge of becoming a Christian.
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.540]   That sister Minji came up to me, her face is beaming.
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:38.180]   She's like, "I never knew that this could be done.
[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.860]   "I could do this."
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:43.060]   I was like, "I know, because you never engaged.
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.860]   "But you finally took the risk.
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.620]   "And this is the joy of it.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.800]   "When you engage with God's Mina,
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.300]   "not only will it multiply,
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.860]   "because that's the powerfulness of God's Mina,
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:55.140]   "not only will it multiply,
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.000]   "but you will also receive the sense of joy,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.300]   "the sense of meaningfulness,
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.700]   "and not only that, God will reward you.
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.080]   "Why wouldn't you want to engage?
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.120]   "Why wouldn't you?"
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:09.100]   It's only if you're, as King says, if you're wicked.
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:10.340]   If you say, "I don't wanna live for God,
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:12.020]   "I wanna live for myself."
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.700]   So God's been really challenging me too, about this.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:16.540]   You know, I'm in Korea, and so it's difficult for me,
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:17.780]   because everyone speaks Korean.
[00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.260]   So you know what, I said, "Lord, wherever I go,
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.020]   "teach me how to engage."
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.460]   So I was at the gym, and I was working out,
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:24.380]   and I've been trying to get myself into shape,
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.980]   and working out, and there was this guy,
[00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:27.940]   really skinny Korean guy, and he was trying to do pull-ups,
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:30.140]   and he's like, "Yeah, yeah!"
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:31.380]   (audience laughs)
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.020]   And he brought a chair over, he's standing on the chair,
[00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:33.860]   "Yeah, yeah!"
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:36.020]   And I was just like, "Okay, chance to engage."
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:38.340]   So I go up to him, and I just said in my broken Korean,
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.820]   I said, "(speaking in foreign language)
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:41.860]   "Can I spot you?"
[00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:43.260]   And he looks over, probably shocked,
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.260]   'cause I don't speak Korean very well,
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:45.820]   he's like, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:48.500]   So I kinda spot him, and I'm holding up the back of his foot,
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.420]   and he's doing like 15, "Ugh, ugh!"
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:52.100]   He comes down, he's like, "Oh, come on, sit down."
[00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:53.340]   I was like, "Oh, no, no, no, no."
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.300]   And so I go up, and then he just walks away.
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:58.140]   (audience laughs)
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:02.420]   But you know what, it didn't matter,
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:05.540]   because I do not engage so I can get something back.
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:08.620]   I engage simply because God has commanded me to engage,
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:10.980]   because my king has told me to engage.
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.900]   And you know what, I'm gonna continue to engage.
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:15.780]   Even yesterday, I went airsoft shooting with my son.
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.020]   I don't know if you guys know what airsoft is,
[00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:20.260]   it's like little plastic pellets, you shoot at each other.
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:23.580]   And we went airsofting in Norwalk over here, or Downey,
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:24.660]   and we're sitting at a table,
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:25.700]   and these two guys come over,
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:26.980]   and they're high school graduates.
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.100]   And I start talking to them, I just start engaging.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:30.020]   You know how I engage them?
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.580]   I say, "Hey, you guys want some Doritos?"
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.100]   That is a powerful way to engage.
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:34.020]   (audience laughs)
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.340]   'Cause no one says no to Doritos, right?
[00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:36.180]   "You like some Doritos?"
[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:37.340]   I'm like, "Oh, yeah, sure."
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:40.300]   And so who's this strange old man giving me Doritos, you know?
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.100]   But they started eating it, they started eating my Doritos,
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:43.380]   and I just started talking to them.
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:44.900]   They just graduated high school.
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:47.180]   One guy is gonna be going to Long Beach Community College,
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.780]   and the other guy, he's gonna be going to Thailand
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.300]   for two years on missions.
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.820]   As soon as he said that, I go, "This guy's a Mormon."
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.700]   And sure enough, I said, "Oh, why are you going on missions?"
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:56.540]   He goes, "Oh, I'm a Mormon."
[00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.620]   I go, "Oh, okay, I already knew."
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:45:59.660]   I didn't convert him.
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:01.500]   That would be an awesome testimony, wouldn't it?
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.340]   I didn't.
[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:03.180]   But you know what?
[00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:04.140]   As I just kept on talking with him, talking with him,
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.940]   and I wish my son was here, he could tell you,
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:07.420]   they were not even talking to each other,
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.540]   they just were talking to me now.
[00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:11.340]   They kept on asking me, they kept on engaging me,
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.580]   and I go, "Wow, Lord, I just took a risk,
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:17.140]   "and I just was obedient, and I just engaged them,
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:18.660]   "and look at the way their hearts are."
[00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:19.540]   That's what's gonna happen.
[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:21.340]   When you start to engage the people at your work,
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:23.180]   and your family, engage them with God's love,
[00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.340]   with the gospel, with kindness, with generosity,
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:26.180]   you know what happens?
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:28.380]   When you're missing, they're gonna go, "Where's John?
[00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:29.220]   "Where's Sam?
[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.020]   "Where's Lisa?"
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:31.940]   Because they're gonna miss you,
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:35.540]   because they realize without you, something's missing.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.060]   It is that grace, it is that goodness,
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:41.100]   it is the life of Christ that he has placed in you.
[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:45.860]   I wanna end with this passage, Matthew 25, verse 31.
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:47.580]   Again, remember, today's parable
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.100]   is really like a futuristic parable.
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:51.660]   He's telling us the framework of our life,
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.620]   and what will our picture look like, right?
[00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:55.460]   So Matthew 25, literally, it is,
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:57.540]   we're getting a glimpse of the end.
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:59.980]   Says this, 25, verse 31.
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.060]   When the Son of Man comes in his glory,
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:03.580]   and all the angels with him,
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:06.580]   then he will sit on his glorious throne, here is the king.
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:09.260]   Before him will be gathered all the nations,
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:11.460]   and he will separate people one from another,
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:14.740]   as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:16.740]   And he will place the sheep on his right,
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:18.740]   and the goats on the left.
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:20.700]   Then the king will say to those on his right,
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:23.380]   come, you who are blessed by my Father,
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:25.500]   inherit the kingdom.
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:28.300]   I give you the kingdom.
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:31.620]   Prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
[00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:34.580]   For I was hungry, and you gave me food.
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:37.180]   You see, giving food is sharing your minna.
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:39.340]   I was thirsty, and you gave me drink.
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:40.340]   Drink is a minna.
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:42.860]   I was a stranger, and you welcomed me.
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:44.320]   I was naked, and you clothed me.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.980]   I was sick, and you visited me.
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.900]   I was in prison, and you came to me,
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:49.700]   visiting and coming to see somebody.
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:51.940]   That is a powerful minna.
[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:53.660]   Then the righteous will answer him, saying,
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:55.100]   Lord, when did we see you hungry,
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:57.660]   and feed you, or thirsty, or give you drink?
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:58.900]   And when did we see you a stranger,
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.140]   and welcome you, or naked, and clothe you?
[00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:03.860]   And when did we see you sick, or in prison, and visit you?
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:05.140]   And the king will answer them,
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.980]   truly I say to you, as you did it to one of the least
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:11.460]   of these my brothers, you did it to me.
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.060]   You see, these sheep,
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:14.780]   they were not even looking for a reward.
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:16.100]   They were not even looking like, where's Jesus?
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.220]   Let me do this, so I can get something from Jesus.
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:21.180]   They were just simply being faithful, obedient, and loving,
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.560]   because of the love and the faithfulness
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.780]   they had received from God.
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:28.260]   If you know that God has given you his son, salvation,
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.460]   forgiven you of your sins, given you the Holy Spirit,
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.180]   given you the word of God, the community,
[00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:36.260]   he has blessed you beyond imagination already.
[00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:38.340]   Then just live it out by sharing that with others,
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:39.820]   the love of God.
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.020]   Just live it out.
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:42.820]   Because God says at the end,
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:45.340]   he wants to say to you, well done,
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:46.980]   good and faithful servant.
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:48.660]   You've been faithful with very little,
[00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:50.220]   now receive much.
[00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.060]   Your reward is great.
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:52.900]   You know, I believe with all my heart,
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.340]   that each of you in this room,
[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.020]   that there is a sphere of influence
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:59.080]   that God wants you to really impact.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.940]   I believe that this church's body,
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:03.900]   that you guys can impact this area powerfully,
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:07.060]   as you each decide, Lord, I'm gonna live,
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:09.320]   and I'm gonna engage with your love, your grace,
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:10.540]   the life you've given to me.
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:12.020]   And not only that, but this is what I hope you all
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:13.540]   will do for each other.
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:14.660]   That you will be praying for each other,
[00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:16.620]   and say, Lord, if you're gonna bless me with five cities,
[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.260]   I pray that you will bless my brother and my sister
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:19.780]   with 10 cities, bless them.
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.860]   Be men and women of generosity, of blessing,
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:24.500]   even as God has blessed you.
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:25.340]   Let's pray.
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:27.220]   Oh, sorry, here is a picture, actual picture of that guy.
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:28.060]   Sorry.
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:31.060]   So I took that picture out, and I superimposed it,
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:32.460]   but this is who he really is.
[00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:33.800]   He gave his life to really invest
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.900]   into international students and be a blessing.
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:37.140]   And this will be his reward.
[00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:38.380]   This will be his reward.
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:40.380]   The meaningfulness of his life well lived.
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:41.740]   Well, let's pray together.
