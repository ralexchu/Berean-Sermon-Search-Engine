[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:48.540]   Okay, all right, that's good.
[00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:55.260]   I want to read the text of the Lord's Prayer
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.180]   and then let me pray
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:58.380]   and then I'll give you a brief encouragement.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.420]   And so today our prayer is gonna be a little bit different
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:02.740]   where I'm gonna have you guys break up
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.820]   into small groups first
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.620]   and then we'll have individual prayer at the end.
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:12.620]   And the text is in Matthew chapter six, verse nine.
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.220]   It says, "Pray then in this way,
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.980]   "Our Father who is in heaven, hallowed be Your name.
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:17.900]   "Your kingdom come.
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.620]   "Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.160]   "Give us this day our daily bread
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.160]   "and forgive us our debts
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.720]   "as we also have forgiven our debtors.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.440]   "Do not lead us into temptation but deliver us from evil
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.060]   "for Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.780]   "forever and ever, amen."
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:33.620]   Let's pray.
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:39.660]   Father, give us understanding.
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:44.020]   Give us a spirit of prayer,
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:48.460]   of reconciliation, of repentance,
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:53.780]   of urgency, Lord God, to spread Your word and Your truth.
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.220]   A deeper conviction, Father,
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.360]   of the things that we already confess.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.340]   A sharpening reality, Lord,
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.140]   of Your presence in our lives.
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:06.360]   A brokenness, Lord, for the loss that is around us.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.660]   A sense of compassion, Father God,
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:10.960]   for those who are hurting.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:14.660]   Help us, Lord God, that we may intercede
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:17.380]   and to pray and to beseech You this evening.
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.200]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.260]   I wanna give you an outline of the Lord's Prayer
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:26.160]   because this is, the disciples,
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.180]   as they were watching Christ and His miracles
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.820]   and all that was happening, and obviously they saw
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.820]   a man who was deeply convicted in prayer
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.100]   and in practice prayer, and so of all the things
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.100]   that they could've asked, they said,
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.680]   "Lord, teach us how to pray," and so as you know,
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.280]   the Lord's Prayer is Jesus answering that question
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.260]   of how to pray.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:46.900]   Typically, we have a tendency to think
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.640]   that I need to get things in order
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.000]   in order for me to pray effectively.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.380]   So our natural tendency is, well,
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.900]   I gotta get my needs met.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.300]   If we're sick, if there's a need in our home,
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.620]   or maybe there's things that I'm struggling with,
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.460]   and so let me deal with that first,
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.060]   and until my life is in order, I can't really come to God
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:07.100]   and to pray effectively.
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.620]   If you look at the order of the Lord's Prayer,
[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:13.100]   it's exactly the opposite, where first and foremost,
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.960]   they beseech the Lord in His, "Hallowed be His name,
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.960]   "His will be done on earth as it is in heaven,"
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.120]   and then He gets into their personal request,
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.120]   give us this day our daily bread,
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.700]   and lead us not into temptation, deliver us from evil,
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:31.500]   and so our natural tendency, again,
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.780]   to think that somehow we need to get right
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.500]   so that we can pray.
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.460]   The Lord's Prayer actually does exactly the opposite.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.460]   In fact, in James chapter four, verse seven, it says,
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.000]   "Submit therefore to God, resist the devil,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.220]   "and he will flee from you," right?
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:50.920]   "Submit to God, therefore, resist the devil,
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.300]   "and he will flee from you."
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.140]   So it's in that order.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.020]   You don't flee from the devil,
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:57.900]   and you don't get things in order
[00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.780]   so that you can do the will of God.
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.260]   He says, "First, do the will of God," right?
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.340]   Part of the reason why we can't do the will of God,
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.500]   part of the reason why we don't have a passion for the lost
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.140]   and why there's an issue of why do I not feel
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:14.260]   a sense of urgency in sharing the gospel,
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:20.900]   maybe because we're not seeking His will first, right?
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.740]   Maybe there's things that we need to bring in order first
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.940]   so that I can win over temptation,
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.100]   and to be delivered from evil, right?
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:33.100]   So we begin by Him saying, "Hallowed be your name," right?
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:37.580]   "Hallowed be your name," meaning God's name be glorified.
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:41.800]   If you know John Piper's book where it says,
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:46.580]   "Mission exists because worship doesn't,"
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:50.940]   meaning that even in missions, even in evangelism,
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:55.640]   the central person or the purpose of missions is God.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:35:01.460]   Before we even are concerned about salvation of the lost,
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:02.780]   if we're not connected to God,
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:06.980]   if our primary purpose isn't to bring honor and glory to God,
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.820]   you miss the whole point of even missions.
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:09.820]   It becomes God-centered.
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.500]   So if you look at this prayer,
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.300]   the focus of the prayer is not man.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.140]   Focus of the prayer is God.
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:20.220]   God is the main character, main focus of our prayer.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.780]   So He said, "Hallowed be your name."
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:25.220]   May your name be magnified, right?
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.780]   And then He says, "Your kingdom come.
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.300]   "Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:32.340]   So first and foremost, when we pray,
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.220]   we are seeking His will, right?
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.000]   Before we come to God with petition.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.620]   There's sicknesses, these are our desires,
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.500]   and all of these things God said.
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.820]   God desires us to pray, but before we do that,
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.860]   we need to make sure that our life and our will,
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:51.820]   our heart, is surrendered to His will.
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:55.440]   You can't live your life seeking your will,
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.700]   and then said, "Lord, would you answer my prayers?"
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.740]   Because your prayers are your will, right?
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:04.200]   We need to make sure that even our pursuit is His will.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:08.180]   And so what I wanna do this evening,
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:09.820]   before we get into anything else,
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.700]   I wanna take some time to seeking His will.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.700]   And so the Bible makes it crystal clear
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.080]   what His will is for us.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.080]   His will for us, I don't know if I,
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.980]   yeah, His main focus of prayer is not man,
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.580]   but God's name and God's will to be done.
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:27.380]   So I wanna pray for missions.
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.860]   So I'm gonna break you guys into groups
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:32.860]   of maybe about three, and no more than four,
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.700]   and we're gonna take some time seeking His will.
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.620]   So the Bible makes it very clear.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.020]   You know, say, "Is it your will that I go to this school,
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:42.060]   "marry this person, or live here, or do that?"
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:44.420]   There's nothing in the Bible that will clarify for you,
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:46.620]   other than your own heart, whether that's God's will or not.
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.820]   God doesn't have you be a doctor, you be a lawyer,
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.780]   you work here, you work there.
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:53.660]   The Bible will never answer that question.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.700]   The Bible will judge the thoughts
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:57.780]   and intentions of your heart.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:58.620]   What is your motive?
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.660]   Why are you asking this, right?
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.300]   And so first and foremost, we need to make sure
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.180]   that our hearts are surrendered to His will,
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.740]   and the Bible makes it very clear what His will is.
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:11.260]   His will is that His name be glorified,
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:13.220]   and the way His name's gonna be glorified
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:15.860]   is that the people who are in rebellion under God
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:17.980]   is restored, right?
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:19.020]   That's His primary purpose.
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.340]   This is the reason why you and I are here,
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.100]   gathered in our church.
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.480]   This is the reason why Christ came,
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.180]   to seek and save the lost.
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.940]   This is the reason why He's being patient,
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.060]   and He hasn't come already 2,000 years ago.
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:33.140]   He said, "In order that more may come into the kingdom."
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.060]   So everything He's doing is for that purpose,
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.820]   to glorify His name by bringing the lost to Christ.
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.520]   So the first and foremost, we wanna take our time
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.100]   to pray for missions, okay?
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.340]   So before I break you up in the group,
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.420]   actually, let me break you up into groups first,
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.820]   and then we're gonna watch this video
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:52.140]   that was sent from Taiwan, Pastor Alex and his family.
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.020]   So we're gonna get a brief update,
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.140]   and the prayer request that they've sent.
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.420]   So we're gonna take some time to pray for them,
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:00.020]   and then we're gonna get to the second part,
[00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.420]   where we're gonna pray for the Easter
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.420]   that's coming up in our church.
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.260]   So why don't you guys break up
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:06.860]   into groups of three and four, okay?
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.820]   So you don't have room to move around.
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.460]   You're gonna have to just turn around
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.880]   and grab a couple people, okay?
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:16.040]   (audience chattering)
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.920]   Yeah, just turn around.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.680]   All right.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:26.680]   Just get comfortable, stay where you are.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:30.320]   All right.
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:34.120]   Okay, if you have your groups,
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:42.080]   we're gonna watch the video and update from the Hans, okay?
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:44.520]   Do I need to get out of the way?
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.000]   You can see over me, right?
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.440]   - Hi, Brian, we're the Hans.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.640]   We live in Kaohsiung, Taiwan,
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.880]   and we've been here for a little bit over a year,
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.080]   and we just wanted to send you this video
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.480]   to share with you some updates on our family
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.480]   and in our ministries.
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:06.640]   - Our family life and our ministry life are really busy,
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.840]   so one of our prayer requests is to ask God
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.700]   to protect our family time,
[00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:14.880]   that we would use the time
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.800]   that we do have all together intentionally,
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:20.520]   also for the kids, for their salvation,
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.920]   and that they would be able
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.960]   to have their own personal relationship with Christ,
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:29.000]   and for their classmates and their classmates' families
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:29.880]   as well.
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:34.700]   A lot of the families that go to the kids' school,
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:35.760]   they are not believers,
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.160]   so we wanna be really purposeful in reaching out to them.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.120]   And I think that's it for our family right now.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.960]   - Yeah, and in terms of our ministry,
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.200]   one of the big prayer requests is just evangelism.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:52.960]   We come across churches, our local partners,
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.400]   and there's just a huge need to train up
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.040]   an evangelistic heart culture in the churches,
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.960]   and that means engaging with the lost.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:07.120]   And at the church that we're serving at right now,
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.920]   we hosted two evangelism trainings,
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.400]   one in English, one in Mandarin,
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.160]   and it was really great.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:18.320]   But one of the heartbreaking observations we made
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.160]   was there are just people who've never heard the gospel,
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.880]   and that was something that was mind-blowing
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.840]   to me personally,
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:28.640]   and it reminded me that while Taiwan is very comfortable
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.520]   and open and,
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:35.240]   we are not on neutral grounds.
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:40.040]   There is a serious darkness that exists on this island
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.400]   and has been preventing,
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:46.320]   or the church has not been faithfully preaching the gospel.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.520]   And so we wanna really pray
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:53.280]   for just having that evangelistic spirit here on this island
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.960]   and especially down here in the South where we are at.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.840]   Our second prayer request is to pray for Easter.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.360]   You know, we are excited about Easter.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:05.040]   We wanna celebrate and we wanna talk about the risen Christ.
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:08.920]   And so pray that churches here in Tainan, Kaohsiung,
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.200]   and Pingtung, we could really be engaged
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:16.560]   in preaching Christ risen from the grave.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.600]   And lastly, just pray for leadership development.
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.320]   At the church that we're serving at,
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.800]   we are, this weekend actually,
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.760]   we're starting a leadership development course,
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.800]   and we're really excited about that.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:31.880]   We're hoping that people will be theologically equipped
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.840]   and be ready to serve the Lord
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.640]   in whatever capacity, whether as a missionary,
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.920]   whether as a pastor,
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.400]   or maybe even just a team member of a church plant.
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.480]   And so we're really excited about that.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.200]   And so please join us in praying
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.520]   that God would raise up new leaders
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:51.480]   to really help with the ministry here in Taiwan.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.040]   Within the next 10 years,
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:58.520]   a good portion of pastors are gonna be retired.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.720]   And so we really need to be prayerful
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.640]   about raising up and equipping
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.120]   the next generation of leaders.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:08.640]   And so we're just, again, thankful for all your support.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:12.320]   We're looking forward to seeing you guys here on the island
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.160]   sometime in the future,
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:17.360]   but we're just always gonna be praying for a Berean,
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.280]   and we always want to always remember that.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.560]   So thank you again for all your prayers.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.560]   Thank you for all your support.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:25.600]   Thank you for all the kind words
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.360]   that you have privately said to us.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:30.520]   And we just pray that we'll see each other again soon.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:31.960]   All right, thank you, guys.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.440]   Bye. - Zaijian.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.280]   - Zaijian.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:38.320]   - Okay, before you go into prayer,
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.240]   again, I just wanted to reiterate,
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:44.160]   we are in the talks, Pastor Alex,
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.440]   even starting from last year,
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.680]   they're doing evangelism projects in the church,
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.680]   and they've asked us to come.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.840]   So that's one of the things that we're working on
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:54.400]   in that coming year, maybe not summer,
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.960]   and I know that we're kind of beginning
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.040]   to get ready for Korea,
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:00.080]   but we're in talks that possibly,
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.760]   maybe sometime in October, November,
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.720]   that we'll begin sending short-term missionaries out there,
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.880]   mission teams out there,
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.600]   and it'll probably be a short one,
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.600]   maybe going on a Thursday and come back the next Saturday
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.800]   so that the people who are working
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.560]   can take just a week and maybe a couple days off
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.480]   to be able to go and help them with evangelism.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.440]   So that's one of the things that we're working on,
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.840]   and as soon as that gets confirmed, we'll let you know,
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.680]   and we'll probably start recruiting
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.600]   maybe sometime in the summer for that.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.880]   Taiwan is an interesting country,
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.760]   'cause we are gonna be praying for Taiwan.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.960]   It's an open country.
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:35.440]   They've had the Western influence there for so long.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.200]   Obviously, it's a free country where it's democratic.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.800]   You can freely preach the gospel there,
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.080]   but the gospel has never taken root there.
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:46.600]   It's been, I think it's like 1% or 2% of the country
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.000]   that's Christian and very superstitious,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.040]   and so they're not necessarily hostile to the gospel,
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.480]   but they're very hardened toward the gospel,
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.040]   and so there's a great need for the gospel
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:01.040]   to bear fruit in that country.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.440]   When we pray for the family,
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.840]   pray for all the things, that one, two, three,
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.200]   you guys can divvy it up in your group to pray,
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.480]   but for any missionary, no matter where they go,
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:15.120]   whether they go to Taiwan or China or wherever they go,
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.800]   the greatest sacrifice that any parent makes
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.360]   in going out to missions is their children,
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.000]   and knowing that every decision a parent makes
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.640]   is what is the best for their child,
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.200]   what's gonna make them the happiest,
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.420]   but every missionary that packs up their bags
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:31.040]   and goes overseas, first and foremost,
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:35.640]   has to sacrifice the comforts and things
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.440]   that most of our children have here,
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:41.740]   and so one of the biggest things
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:43.640]   that we need to pray for is for their children.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:46.000]   We have so many children out in the mission field
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.920]   who struggle as the parents are doing the work,
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.800]   and a lot of the missionaries end up coming back
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.960]   because the children have such a hard time
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:55.160]   adjusting to wherever they are,
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.180]   and then because they begin to rebel
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.880]   and move away from God, many missionaries
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.160]   end up coming back home for the sake of their children,
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.820]   so one, let's pray for what they've asked for,
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.120]   for that the children will come to faith early,
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.720]   if you can pray for those things,
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.600]   and then the second part of it, ministry prayer,
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.520]   they're actively engaging in evangelism.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.740]   He told me that they went door to door,
[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.420]   and it kind of awakened the church
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.220]   because evangelism is not something
[00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.080]   that's emphasized in that country.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:24.120]   It's just kind of, you know,
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.580]   they just kind of accepted the fact
[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:26.420]   that people aren't open.
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:27.400]   It's kind of like Orange County.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:29.760]   They just assume that people are not interested,
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.920]   and he told me that once they went out
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.200]   and started going door to door
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.600]   and just talking to people,
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:38.560]   realizing how many people know nothing of the gospel.
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.420]   It's not that they've heard it and rejected it.
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.020]   They don't know it at all,
[00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:44.880]   so the churches there are not actively evangelizing.
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.760]   The Christians there are not sharing their faith,
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.960]   and so he told me that one of the main goals
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.440]   of the church now is to mobilize
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.480]   and to begin to do evangelism,
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.680]   and that's why he is hoping that at some point
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.000]   we will be able to bring our team out
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.440]   and to do some training and then to go along with them
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:04.960]   to kind of do a catalyst for evangelism
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.200]   for not only that church,
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.500]   but other churches that will get involved,
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.160]   so if you can pray for that,
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.960]   and then obviously they have Easter coming up,
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:12.800]   so pray for that,
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.460]   and then the leadership development in the church, okay?
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:18.080]   So if I can break you up into groups of three like you are,
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.040]   just assign different people,
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.320]   and then when you guys are ready,
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.880]   maybe in about seven minutes,
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.200]   I'll call you guys back,
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.800]   and then we'll get to the second part, okay?
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:27.840]   All right, so just turn around.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.500]   Assign the people to the prayer topics.

[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.500]   (congregation chattering)

[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.500]   (congregation chattering)
[00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:46.000]   (congregation chattering)
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.500]   (congregation chattering)
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:54.000]   (congregation chattering)
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.500]   (congregation chattering)
[00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:02.000]   (congregation chattering)
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.500]   (congregation chattering)
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:09.000]   (congregation chattering)
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.500]   (congregation chattering)
[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:16.000]   (congregation chattering)
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.500]   (congregation chattering)
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:23.000]   (congregation chattering)
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.500]   (congregation chattering)
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:30.000]   (congregation chattering)
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.500]   (congregation chattering)
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   And for the second part,
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   and you can continue to pray for the things
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   if you haven't finished yet,
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   but for the second part,
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   I wanna pray for the Easter week that's coming,
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.500]   the Passion Week that's coming.
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:16.500]   As we're praying for God's will to be done,
[00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:19.000]   again, before anything else that we seek,
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   we know that this is His heart.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.500]   The Bible says, "If you abide in me, my words abide in you.
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:25.500]   "Ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for you."
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.500]   If there's anything that we have confidence
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:31.000]   that God desires to answer is the prayer
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   to get the Gospel out, to seek and save the lost.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.500]   So I have three prayers,
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.500]   but again, obviously, it's not limited to these things.
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:43.000]   First of all, pray that there will be a spirit of urgency
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.500]   to spread the Gospel, not just, oh, it's important,
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.000]   and that's something to be done,
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   and we have a team that goes and evangelizes,
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   but each one of our hearts,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.500]   that if you haven't prayed fervently for the lost,
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.500]   first and foremost, that God would open your eyes
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:01.500]   and soften your heart.
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:04.500]   An honest question that we need to be asking ourselves is,
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:10.500]   how do I confess that I'm living around
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:13.500]   and in the context of people that we confess
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:16.500]   that when Christ comes are going to be judged for eternity
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:19.500]   and yet not feel any compassion?
[00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:23.500]   I'm more concerned about my bills being paid.
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.500]   I'm more concerned about the school that I'm trying to get.
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.500]   I'm more concerned about my children's health,
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:31.500]   and I have very little concern for the people
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.500]   who do not know Christ.
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:35.500]   There's something off, right?
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:37.500]   Something has happened to our hearts.
[00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:40.500]   Something has seriously gone astray,
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:44.500]   and so first and foremost, that every time we do this,
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:46.500]   it's not just for the lost.
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:49.500]   The Church needs to get to a point
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:54.500]   where spreading the Gospel and interceding for the lost
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.500]   becomes our second nature.
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:59.500]   That every opportunity we get, that your kingdom come,
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.500]   your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:03.500]   So that God would use this week,
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:07.500]   and that you would use this week to really reawaken.
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.500]   If you strayed and your heart has been hardened,
[00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:13.500]   I don't know how many of you can honestly say
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:17.500]   that God has used you to bring somebody to Christ.
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:21.500]   If you've never, and you've been a Christian for 5, 10 years,
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:24.500]   and you have never brought a single person to Christ,
[00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:30.500]   maybe that's something that you can really put on paper, right?
[00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:33.500]   "Lord, I want to be able to share the Gospel
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:35.500]   and bring someone to Christ."
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:38.500]   So along with that, I'm going to ask you,
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:41.500]   not like, "Oh, I did my part, I cleaned the Church,"
[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.500]   and all those things are important.
[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:45.500]   We have various, like, different gifts,
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:50.500]   but to really be able to intercede on their behalf
[00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:55.500]   and to pray so that God would awaken a soberness
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:57.500]   of what it is that we are doing.
[00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:00.500]   Why are we gathered here together, right?
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:02.500]   And two, for yourself, and two,
[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:06.500]   who are people around you that are not believers?
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:09.500]   It may be a family friend, it may be your brother,
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:11.500]   your sister, your mom, your dad, and uncle,
[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:14.500]   maybe your co-worker that you're really close to,
[00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:15.500]   that you've been thinking, like,
[00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:17.500]   "I've got to share the Gospel with them,
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:19.500]   and this is a great opportunity to invite them to church
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.500]   where the Gospel will be taught,
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:23.500]   and maybe that'll spark an opportunity
[00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.500]   for you to share the Gospel."
[00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:26.500]   And don't just pray because,
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.500]   "This is somebody I need to check off."
[00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:32.500]   If your heart isn't hurting for them,
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:34.500]   come before the Lord in an honest confession.
[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:36.500]   "Why do I believe he's going to go to hell,
[00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:38.500]   and it doesn't bother me?
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:41.500]   Why is it just my duty? I checked, I prayed for them,
[00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:45.500]   but outside of that, how come that doesn't bother me?"
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:46.500]   Right?
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:48.500]   So that's something that we need to pray for,
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:51.500]   that ask the Lord to open my eyes
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:53.500]   that God had so much compassion,
[00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:56.500]   he was willing to send his only begotten Son,
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:58.500]   his only begotten Son,
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:01.500]   and yet our hearts so callous when we see the lost, right?
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:05.500]   So before you pray for the lost generally,
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:10.500]   pray passionately for the people that you love, right?
[00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:11.500]   Pray passionately.
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:12.500]   Don't just pray passing.
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.500]   Pray passionately for people that you love,
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:17.500]   and cry out on their behalf,
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:20.500]   "Lord, save them. You have to save them,"
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:22.500]   and plead on their behalf, okay?
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:25.500]   And then, obviously, through all of it,
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:28.500]   ultimately, we want God's name to be glorified, right?
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:31.500]   If the church wakes up and prays
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:33.500]   and is concerned for the lost
[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:36.500]   and lives in such a way where we're being the light in the world,
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:38.500]   God's name will be glorified.
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:41.500]   So let's pray specifically for Palm Sunday,
[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:43.500]   where we kick it off,
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:47.500]   that even from then that we would pray earnestly,
[00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:50.500]   and then each night, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:52.500]   Thursday we have the Passover meal,
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:56.500]   and then Friday we have the Good Friday service and communion,
[00:59:56.500 --> 01:00:00.500]   that each of the nights that the pastors are going to be going over the day,
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:01.500]   pray for that.
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:04.500]   Pray for the various people who come and give their testimonies,
[01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.500]   and that even your co-workers,
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.500]   if maybe they're nominal Christians or they've fallen out,
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:14.500]   maybe those are opportunities for them to come and to pray and to interact.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:16.500]   And then for Good Friday service,
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:22.500]   that the cross, that we would not be numb to what Christ has done on the cross,
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:26.500]   that we would really come to that service desiring to be broken,
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:30.500]   and then to be able to come on Sunday to celebrate early rise service,
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.500]   pray for that.
[01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:34.500]   Pray for the non-Christians who will be joining us throughout the week,
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.500]   and especially on that Sunday.
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.500]   More people are willing to come to church on Sunday,
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.500]   on Easter Sunday and Christmas, than any other Sunday.
[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:45.500]   And the Bible tells us to redeem every opportunity,
[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:49.500]   and this is an opportunity that we have every single year in this country,
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:54.500]   and so we are surrounded by people who confess to be Christians and may not be.
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:57.500]   And then we are surrounded by people who don't know anything about the gospel,
[01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.500]   but they think that they do.
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:02.500]   So let's take this opportunity first and foremost,
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.500]   pray for the people that you love,
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.500]   pray for your co-workers,
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.500]   pray specifically, by name,
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:10.500]   those people that you really want to bring them to Christ,
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.500]   and then secondly, pray for the specific events
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.500]   and the pastors and the people who will be sharing.
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.500]   So let me break you up into your groups,
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:18.500]   divide these things,
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.500]   share the people that you want to pray for,
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.500]   and maybe after you pray for that,
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.500]   pray for the general events that are going to be taking place.
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:26.500]   Okay?
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.500]   So I'll call you back in about 10 minutes after you take some time to pray over that.
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:30.500]   Okay?
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:34.500]   (crowd murmuring)
