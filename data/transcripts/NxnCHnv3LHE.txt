[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.660]   Merry Christmas and happy Lord's Day.
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:54.660]   We also wanna welcome all of you
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.660]   who are joining us for the first time,
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.660]   for those who are tuning in on the live stream.
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.660]   As we begin our service,
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.660]   I would like to read from a passage in Luke 2,
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.660]   verses eight through 14, and it goes,
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.660]   "And in the same region,
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.660]   there were shepherds out in the field,
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.660]   keeping watch over their flock by night.
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.660]   And an angel of the Lord appeared to them,
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.660]   and the glory of the Lord shone around them,
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.660]   and they were filled with fear.
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.660]   And the angel said to them, 'Fear not,
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.660]   for behold, I bring you good news of great joy
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.660]   that will be for all the people.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.660]   For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior,
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.660]   who is Christ the Lord,
[00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.660]   and this will be a sign for you.
[00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.660]   You will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.660]   and lying in the manger.'
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.660]   And suddenly there was with the angel
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.660]   a multitude of the heavenly hosts,
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.660]   praising God and saying,
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.660]   'Glory to God in the highest,
[00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.660]   and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased.'"
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.660]   So why don't we all rise as we sing our first song,
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.660]   "Go Tell It on the Mountain."

[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.660]   And remember that all the signups are on our app.

[00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.660]   The last thing I wanna highlight is,
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.660]   right now with the holiday season,
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.660]   we've been announcing that there are various opportunities
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.660]   to do holiday ministry.
[00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.660]   Today is going to be the last day to sign up
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.660]   for various things like the Voice of Refugees,
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.660]   Compassion, and Rescue Mission.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.660]   Those links are, again, on the app and the Facebook,

[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.660]   if you'd like to be involved in that.
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.660]   And then finally, as we announced last week,
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.660]   today is going to be the Lottie Moon
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.660]   special missions offering.

[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.660]   that this is for the Lottie Moon missions offering,
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.660]   apart from the regular Sunday offering, okay?
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.660]   At this time, let's pray together,
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.660]   and we'll head into offering time.
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:38.660]   Heavenly Father, we wanna thank you, God.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.660]   We thank you, Lord, from the bottom of our hearts
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.660]   for your incredible love and your mercies.
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:47.660]   We thank you, God, today that you sent your Son, Lord,
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.660]   for the Lord Jesus Christ to leave that heavenly abode
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.660]   so that God, he would reach to us.
[00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.660]   Lord, we want to continue just to grow in our understanding
[00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.660]   of what depths you came down.
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.660]   And we thank you, Lord, and we pray that all the more
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.660]   we will worship you for the sacrifice that you made.
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.660]   And we pray, Father God, that our gratitude
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.660]   will continue to overflow to you.
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.660]   So as we sing, may you be glorified
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.660]   in the way that we serve and give
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.660]   and the way that we witness.
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.660]   May it be pleasing in your sight.
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.660]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ, and we pray, amen.

[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:41.160]   - All right, good morning.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.160]   Welcome to Bering Community Church,
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:46.160]   those of you who are here and those of you who are online.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.160]   Again, today is our special Christmas service
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.160]   and obviously that normally we have children who perform,
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.160]   you know, they prepare and perform up here on the stage
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:57.160]   and obviously this year we're not able to do that.
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.160]   It's been a very strange year this year, 2020.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.160]   But again, we believe that God is sovereign,
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.160]   that even in the midst of all of this,
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.160]   that God has a purpose for all of this.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.160]   If you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.160]   to 1 Corinthians 1, I'm going to be reading
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.160]   from verse 22 through 25.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:18.160]   Okay, 1 Corinthians 1, 22 through 25.
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:23.160]   "For in these, Jews ask for signs
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.160]   "and Greeks search for wisdom,
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.160]   "but we preach Christ crucified.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.160]   "To Jews, a stumbling block,
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.160]   "and to the Gentiles, foolishness.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.160]   "But to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks,
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.160]   "Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.160]   "Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men,
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.160]   "and the weakness of God is stronger than men."
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.160]   Let's pray.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:50.160]   Heavenly Father, we thank you and praise you
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.160]   for the privilege that we have to be able to come
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.160]   and worship you.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.160]   Especially now, Lord God, as we've gathered together
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.160]   to celebrate Christ's birth and what it means for us.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:04.160]   Help us, Lord God, to open our ears, our eyes,
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.160]   soften our hearts, as you are the potter
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.160]   and we are the clay, that you would mold us
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.160]   according to your purpose and will.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.160]   So we pray, Father God, that your Holy Spirit
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.160]   would take the words that are taught
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.160]   and it would illuminate us, that we may understand
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.160]   and apply it in our lives.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.160]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.160]   Donald Trump.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:30.160]   As soon as I say his name, in our generation,
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.160]   you get different emotions, right?
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.160]   So the people, depending on where you stand
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.160]   on your politics, when you say Donald Trump,
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:40.160]   he is either Hitler or the best president
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.160]   the United States has ever had in history.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.160]   Maybe next to Lincoln or better than Lincoln.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.160]   And obviously you have people who have opinions
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.160]   kind of on either side, variation.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.160]   Whatever your politics is, we have to admit
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:58.160]   that this political year probably has been
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.160]   the most polarizing of anything that I can remember.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:07.160]   And sad to say, churches and even some family members
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.160]   are so heated debates on either side.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:13.160]   But whatever the case, Donald Trump
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.160]   was not going to save the world.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:20.160]   Our political system is made in such a way
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.160]   there's checks and balances, no matter what president
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.160]   is in there, they have other branches
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.160]   that kind of, he needs to get permission
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.160]   and make sure that he doesn't have all power.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.160]   And no matter who gets elected, every four years
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.160]   they have to do it again.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.160]   And so someone else might come in,
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.160]   and then whoever gets elected there,
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.160]   another person will come in.
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.160]   He is not going to affect the eternity of mankind.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.160]   But there is an individual that you and I
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:45.160]   are here to celebrate that was equally,
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.160]   even more polarizing.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.160]   Some said he was a crazy man.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:52.160]   He came and claimed to be the son of God
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.160]   and then fooled all these people.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.160]   Now 2,000 years later, millions of people
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.160]   have been fooled by this man
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.160]   and have wasted countless amount of money, lives
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.160]   telling and proclaiming the things that he said
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.160]   that he was.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.160]   Or he actually was the son of God
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.160]   who came to save mankind.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.160]   C.S. Lewis says it like this about Jesus.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:19.160]   "A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:22.160]   "that Jesus said and would not be a great moral teacher.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:25.160]   "He would either be a lunatic on a level with the man
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.160]   "who says he is a poached egg,
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.160]   "or else he would be the devil of hell.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:32.160]   "You must make your choice.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.160]   "Either this man was and is the son of God,
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:37.160]   "or else a madman or something worse.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.160]   "You can shut him up for a fool.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.160]   "You can spit at him and kill him as a demon,
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.160]   "or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.160]   "But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.160]   "about his being a great human teacher.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.160]   "He has not left that open to us.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.160]   "He did not intend to."
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:59.160]   Where we stand on who Jesus is
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.160]   will either affect our eternity--
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.160]   we praise him as our Lord and Savior,
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.160]   and so we believe that when we die
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.160]   that we have eternity with him for eternity--
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.160]   or we reject him as a crazy man.
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.160]   There's nothing in between.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.160]   You cannot come and say, "Well, there's a lot of good things
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.160]   "to learn from a man who said he was God."
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.160]   There is no good thing to glean from a person
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.160]   who said that he died and resurrected from the dead.
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.160]   Either he really is what he says he is,
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.160]   or he's a crazy man to be forgotten.
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:36.160]   2,000 years later, Jesus' name is proclaimed more today
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.160]   than it was 2,000 years ago.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.160]   The effects that Jesus had on humanity,
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.160]   whether you believe or don't believe, we all agree,
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:50.160]   had probably the greatest impact in human history.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.160]   So today we want to look at--
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.160]   in the early church when Christ was being proclaimed,
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.160]   the text says as Apostle Paul was going to preach
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:03.160]   the gospel of Jesus Christ, he said, "Some asked for signs."
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:07.160]   The Jews asked for signs, and the Greeks looked for wisdom,
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:10.160]   but he says, "We preach Christ crucified."
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.160]   He said, "Christ crucified was a stumbling block to the Jews,
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:17.160]   "and it is foolishness to those who are looking for wisdom,
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.160]   "but to those who are being saved, it is the power of God
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.160]   "and the wisdom of God."
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:26.160]   So let's look at, first of all, why were the Jews asking for signs?
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:29.160]   I mean, you may have thought at least at one point in your life,
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:34.160]   thinking that if Jesus would only just physically appear, right,
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:38.160]   if he just split the heavens open and says, "I am," right,
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.160]   and say, "Oh, that would affect my walk."
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:44.160]   Why were the Jews constantly asking for signs?
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.160]   It wasn't because Jesus didn't give signs.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.160]   In fact, the Bible repeats it over and over,
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:53.160]   that he kept on performing miracles to prove who he was.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.160]   Jesus changed water into wine.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.160]   He opened the eyes of the blind.
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:01.160]   He healed lepers. He walked on water.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:05.160]   And then he even actually raised people from the dead.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:10.160]   He used all of this to show who he said he was was true.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:14.160]   And yet the Bible keeps saying that they wanted more signs.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.160]   In John 2, 18, when he was at the temple and cleansed them,
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.160]   the leaders came to him and said, "What sign do you show?
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:24.160]   "Show us as your authority for doing these things."
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.160]   Now, you have to remember that Jesus performed these miracles
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:30.160]   not all over the land.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.160]   The majority of his miracles happened in these three cities,
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.160]   basically the size of Orange County.
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:39.160]   And for two years, everything that he did,
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.160]   so the majority of the people there either heard of him
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.160]   or saw the miracle themselves.
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.160]   In fact, the leaders of Israel in Jerusalem,
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:50.160]   which was kind of a distance between here and San Francisco,
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.160]   heard of Jesus' fame and all that he was doing,
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.160]   and they said, "Could he possibly be the Messiah?"
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:00.160]   So they all came up to Galilee in order to check this out
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.160]   because that's how clear he was.
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:05.160]   He wasn't doing this in private. He wasn't doing this in his home.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:08.160]   He wanted to publicly show everybody who he was.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:12.160]   And yet they continued to come and said, "We need signs."
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:16.160]   In John 6, verse 2, that's a passage where after two years
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:20.160]   of performing miracles, thousands of people are now coming to him,
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:24.160]   thousands, because they're starting to be convinced
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.160]   he must be the Messiah.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.160]   He's the one that we've been waiting for.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.160]   So they packed up their bags, and he went up to the hillside,
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.160]   and they all went up with him.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.160]   So that's 5,000 men, including women and children,
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.160]   possibly up to 20,000 people followed him up on the hill.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.160]   And this is what he says.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:44.160]   Before he performs the miracle of the bread and the fish,
[00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:48.160]   John 6, 2, a large crowd followed him because they saw the signs
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:52.160]   which he was performing on those who were sick.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.160]   So they were convinced by these signs.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.160]   He must be the Messiah.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:00.160]   John 6, 14, after he feeds the 5,000, they say,
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:03.160]   "Therefore when the people saw the sign which he had performed,
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:07.160]   they said, 'This truly is the prophet who is to come into the world.'"
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:13.160]   So before the miracle of multiplying the bread and the fish,
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:16.160]   they said, "We came because clearly you show signs."
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:20.160]   After they ate the miraculous bread and fish, they said,
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:24.160]   "Clearly, if there was any doubt, you have to be the Messiah."
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.160]   So they want to forcefully make him king because of the sign.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:29.160]   Well, Jesus and his disciples are tired.
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.160]   They go to the other side of the sea.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.160]   20,000 people see that he's not there.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.160]   They pack up their bags, and then they go look for him,
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.160]   and then when they encounter Jesus, Jesus sees right through
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:42.160]   what they were doing, and Jesus says in 626,
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.160]   "Jesus answered them and said, 'Truly, truly, I say to you,
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.160]   you seek me not because you saw signs,
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:52.160]   but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.'"
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.160]   In other words, you're coming to me, even though you're saying
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.160]   that you clearly see the sign, and we want you to be our king
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.160]   because we see the sign, Jesus says,
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.160]   "You're not coming to me because you saw the sign.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:06.160]   You're coming to me because you ate bread, and you want more."
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:09.160]   And the response in John 6:30, "So they said to him,
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:12.160]   'Well, if what you are saying is true, if you are truly the bread,
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.160]   what sign do you do?'"
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:18.160]   And they just couldn't get over it.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:21.160]   He's performing sign after sign after sign after sign.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:23.160]   They came to him because they saw the sign.
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.160]   They wanted him to be king because they saw the sign.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.160]   And yet at the end, he said, "Well, prove yourself.
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.160]   Show us signs."
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:35.160]   In fact, Apostle Peter, when he is preaching in front of the same people
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:40.160]   who yelled out, "Crucify Jesus," in Acts 2.22, he says,
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.160]   "Men of Israel, listen to these words.
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:46.160]   Jesus of Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles,
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:50.160]   wonders, and signs, which God performed through him in your midst,
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.160]   just as you yourselves know."
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:56.160]   Peter, just in case anybody missed it, he says,
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.160]   "It was clear what he was doing.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:03.160]   Everything that he did and he performed proved who he said he was."
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:06.160]   And yet, as Apostle Paul was preaching the gospel, he says,
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.160]   "They kept on asking for signs."
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:12.160]   What were they missing?
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:15.160]   By their own admission, they said they saw the signs.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.160]   They came into Jerusalem after Lazarus was raised
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:21.160]   because they wanted to see the signs.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:25.160]   In fact, the signs were so clear, even the people who wanted to crucify Jesus
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.160]   could not deny the signs.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.160]   And yet, as he was preaching the gospel, he says,
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.160]   "Well, we're not going to believe until you show us the signs."
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:35.160]   So what are we missing here?
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:39.160]   What does he mean that he wants signs?
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:42.160]   Well, you have to remember what the Israels were looking for.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:47.160]   They were God's covenant people, and they thought that if they remained faithful to God,
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.160]   that they were going to be the superpower,
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.160]   that they were going to be Egypt, they were going to be Rome,
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:58.160]   they were going to be the Babylonians, but that never happened.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:03.160]   They experienced a brief period of success during King David and possibly Solomon,
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.160]   but the rest of their history--if you've ever read the Old Testament--
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:10.160]   the rest of their history is Israel constantly falling into sin over and over again.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:15.160]   And eventually, they get conquered by the Assyrians, and then the Babylonians,
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:18.160]   and then the Persians, and then the Greeks, and then the Romans.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:24.160]   So by the time Jesus comes, they had generation after generation after generation
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:28.160]   of being dominated by these superpowers.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:35.160]   So they thought if the Messiah comes, he's going to take vengeance upon their enemies,
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:39.160]   that he's going to overthrow the Roman government, and they're going to be the superpower,
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:42.160]   and they were going to be on top.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:46.160]   And that's why even the disciples, as Jesus was going to the cross,
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:50.160]   he kept on telling them, "I'm going to be beaten, crucified, and be raised."
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.160]   Remember their response? They couldn't get that out of their head.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:57.160]   Well, who's going to be the Secretary of State? Who's going to be the Vice President?
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.160]   Who are you going to appoint, to the left or to the right?
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:04.160]   And even as Jesus was saying, "I'm coming to die for this world,"
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:08.160]   and they said, "Well, when the Romans are taken over and we are the superpower,
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:11.160]   what's going to happen to us?"
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:17.160]   So you could see the hope that they had when they saw the signs that he was performing.
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:21.160]   He must be the Messiah. Who else can do what he is doing?
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:28.160]   And yet, the problem that they had with Jesus was not what he was doing, but what he was saying.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:33.160]   The Sermon on the Mount, in Matthew 5, 38-44,
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:38.160]   "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:43.160]   But I say to you, do not resist an evil person, but whoever slaps you on your right cheek,
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:46.160]   turn the other to him also."
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:50.160]   Now, that sounds beautiful at church.
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:57.160]   It sounds beautiful to sing about and tell other people that Jesus told us to turn the other cheek.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:00.160]   Tell that to somebody who's angry.
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:04.160]   Tell that to somebody who's upset. Turn the other cheek.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:11.160]   Again, it sounds great at church, but how many of you, when somebody wrongs you,
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:15.160]   your natural reaction is the other cheek?
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:21.160]   If somebody comes to you when you are wronged, let's say you're at a supermarket and somebody cuts in line.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:24.160]   It's a 30-minute line and they're tired of it and they cut right in front of you.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:27.160]   Do you say, "Well, thank you"?
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:30.160]   Go even further up. No, that's not our natural reaction.
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:33.160]   We want vengeance.
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:37.160]   We want to bump them with the cart, go in front of them, because it's wrong.
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:41.160]   When you're wronged, our natural reaction isn't to turn the other cheek.
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:49.160]   So imagine the Romans or the Jews had generations of this frustration.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:54.160]   And they were waiting for the Messiah to come to galvanize the Israelites,
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:59.160]   to prepare them to go into Jerusalem and conquer Rome.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:02.160]   And they've never ever come close to this.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:06.160]   This is the first time in generation after generation after generation,
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:10.160]   they have somebody who can literally just say to the storm, "Stop!"
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.160]   And it stops.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:16.160]   That even if somebody dies, he says, "Be raised," and they are raised.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:21.160]   If there was any hope in their history, this was the first time.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:27.160]   First time Jesus walking into Jerusalem and saying, "He's going to fulfill what we've been waiting for."
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:34.160]   And yet, what he was doing and what he was saying didn't fit.
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:41.160]   How can a man be so powerful just tell us to turn the other cheek?
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.160]   He goes further than that.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:48.160]   If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:52.160]   You have to remember, this is not a period when people had a wardrobe.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:56.160]   An average person usually had one inner clothing and one outer clothing.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:01.160]   So basically he's saying if somebody asks for it, just give them all your clothes and walk around naked.
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.160]   That's not practical.
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.160]   He's basically saying don't resist them, give it to them.
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:10.160]   Sounds beautiful at church, but it's impossible to practice,
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:15.160]   especially with somebody who's already angry, wanting vengeance.
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:16.160]   Turn the other cheek.
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.160]   Whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him to two.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.160]   You know why he says that, go one mile, go two?
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:24.160]   Because there was a Roman law.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:29.160]   By law, if the soldiers came into town and they had heavy armory and he got tired,
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:32.160]   he can just stop anybody.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:36.160]   So if they happen to be in Jerusalem walking around and here's this pregnant lady with two children,
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:43.160]   but he's tired, you take my sword, take my shield, and you walk with me for an hour, for one mile.
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:44.160]   And by law, they had to do that.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:49.160]   So can you imagine the resentment that they had toward the Roman soldiers?
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:53.160]   Instead of saying, just give us some time, we're organizing.
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.160]   The zealots are going to organize, we're sharpening our knives,
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:02.160]   we're going to pretend like we're submitting, but when the time is right, we're going to get at them.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.160]   Don't worry about it.
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:10.160]   Instead, he says, if he tells you to go one mile, go the extra mile.
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:15.160]   Give to him who asks you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you.
[00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:20.160]   You have heard that it was said, you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:25.160]   But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:30.160]   Not only did Jesus say this, he actually practiced this.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:34.160]   When he went into Jerusalem, remember, Peter was ready to fight.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:38.160]   When the soldiers came to take Jesus, Peter took out his sword.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.160]   Why not?
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:44.160]   Even though he's not a swordsman, Jesus walks on water.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.160]   Jesus can calm storms.
[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:53.160]   If he's going to sit in Jesus' cabinet, when he comes into power, he better be courageous.
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:55.160]   So he takes out his sword and he swings.
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:59.160]   Jesus actually ends up rebuking him, puts the ear back on the guy that he cut.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:02.160]   And Jesus says, do you not know?
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:10.160]   Do you not know if I wanted to, I could send legions of angels to wipe these guys all out?
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:17.160]   As he's standing before Pilate, Pilate says, clearly what they're asking to do to crucify you is not fair.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:20.160]   You're not deserving of crucifixion.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:24.160]   Do you not know that I have the power to release you and give you life?
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.160]   Why do you not defend yourself?
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:31.160]   And Jesus says to him in John 18.36, my kingdom is not of this world.
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:37.160]   If my kingdom were of this world, then my servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:41.160]   But as it is, my kingdom is not of this realm.
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:44.160]   And he surrendered.
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.160]   That's why the disciples were confused.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:50.160]   I think before they were scared, they were confused.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:53:01.160]   Why would this powerful Messiah not only tell them to give in, but not stand up for himself?
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:10.160]   These Romans again are taking the only hope that they had and they're going to kill him and he does nothing.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:14.160]   So as he is going to the cross, the disciples are following from a distance.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:17.160]   I don't think they were scared. They were confused.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:24.160]   Why would he do that? Even though Jesus clearly told them and he gave them the signs.
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:30.160]   They were blind because they were so fixated on what they wanted the Messiah to be.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:35.160]   And so when he gave himself up, they hid.
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:39.160]   Out of confusion and now out of fear.
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:43.160]   And that's why even when Jesus was being resurrected, Jesus clearly says,
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:47.160]   on the third day I will resurrect, on the third day I will resurrect.
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:50.160]   But when Jesus resurrected, the disciples didn't even go to check.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:57.160]   Because what Jesus did by giving himself was so far from what they expected the Messiah to do,
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:00.160]   they forgot about everything and went home.
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:04.160]   They didn't even check. And then when the women came back and said he's not in the tomb,
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:08.160]   they didn't even believe it.
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:12.160]   See, what they were rejecting was not simply Jesus.
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:15.160]   They were rejecting his kingdom.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:22.160]   And that's why even though they saw all these signs, it didn't fit the Messiah that they had in their head.
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:30.160]   And that's why they kept on saying, so the sign that they want is not simply to turn bread and then multiply it.
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:34.160]   It wasn't simply for him to walk on the water. To do something with that.
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:40.160]   If you have all that power and if you're the Messiah, take vengeance upon Rome.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:44.160]   That's what they're saying. We want signs.
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:49.160]   Think about how much what we do, we miss Christ,
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:54.160]   because he doesn't quite fit what we think he should be doing in our lives.
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:58.160]   So we either walk away from him or we keep our distance.
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:04.160]   And we admire him from a distance, but he's not quite the Messiah that I want.
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:06.160]   The Greeks wanted wisdom.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:10.160]   You have to understand the Greeks, wisdom basically was their religion.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:15.160]   They had more than 50 different schools of philosophies.
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:21.160]   Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Stoics, Epicureans, Skeptics, Pythagoras, on and on and on.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:24.160]   And so their religion was their knowledge.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:27.160]   So they would come into the villages and they would set up shop.
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:32.160]   And then the Platos and the Stoics would sit there and they would debate each other.
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.160]   And then people would basically come.
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:38.160]   And if you happen to have the greater argument, you would become a celebrity.
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.160]   And if you're a celebrity, you would make the money.
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:46.160]   And so at that time, it was the philosophers who were the entertainers.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:49.160]   Philosophers were the movie stars.
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.160]   They were the celebrities.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:56.160]   And so they're saying, "If you want your religion to be better than ours, prove it.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.160]   Give us the knowledge."
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:04.160]   Now, Apostle Paul could have easily, easily wiped them clean with his knowledge,
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:09.160]   because in Acts 22, verse 3, he says he was a direct disciple of Gamaliel.
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:12.160]   Gamaliel was a top scholar of Israel.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:18.160]   In fact, Gamaliel is very well known outside of the Christian circle because of his scholarship.
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:21.160]   Some believe that he may have become a Christian, but that's not for sure.
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:26.160]   But for sure, it says, "Apostle Paul was very, very highly educated."
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:35.160]   So if he wanted to, he could come into any village and just wipe them clean just with his knowledge.
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:43.160]   In fact, in Acts 26, verse 24, as Apostle Paul is in prison, he's standing before each of the leaders.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:48.160]   Instead of defending himself, he starts preaching the gospel about Jesus Christ.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:56.160]   So Governor Festus, recognizing who Apostle Paul says this, he says both Jews and Greeks,
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:01.160]   he says this in verse 24 of Acts 26, "While Paul was saying this in his defense,
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:08.160]   Festus said in a loud voice, 'Paul, you are out of your mind. Your great learning is driving you mad.'"
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:16.160]   So the governor of Jerusalem already knew about Paul, that he was very well educated.
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:20.160]   But instead of using that knowledge to defend himself, he said, "You must have gone mad.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:23.160]   You just went too far."
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:29.160]   Apostle Paul, if he thought that the power was in knowledge, he could have wiped them clean.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:33.160]   If the power was just with the miracles, they could have went to each city and just performed miracles.
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:37.160]   And I remember when the charismatic movement was sweeping the land,
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:45.160]   and I remember praying that God would give me the gift of healing for the purpose of evangelism.
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:48.160]   And I say, "If I had the gift of healing, I would go to Angel Stadium,
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:53.160]   and when people come to get their peanuts and hot dogs, I would just slay people right there."
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:54.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:58.160]   Instead of every week, like, slaving over to, like, "What does this mean? What is this tech?
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.160]   What's the Greek? What's the syntax?"
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:04.160]   I just read a passage and just go out and just slay people.
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:07.160]   And believe in Jesus, and if you don't, this is going to happen to you, you know?
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:12.160]   Go to Dodger Stadium or go to some parade and knock people out, you know?
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:16.160]   If that's what was going to bring them to Christ, he said, "If that's what they needed,
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:20.160]   the apostles could have easily done that."
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:25.160]   But he says, "They want science. Greeks want wisdom."
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:28.160]   He said, "We preach Christ crucified."
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:31.160]   He said it was a stumbling block to the Jews.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:36.160]   The word "stumbling" basically means, in Greek, it's "skandalon." It became "scandalous."
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:43.160]   That Christ crucified caused the Jews to stumble because the very Messiah that they were hoping and praying for,
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:46.160]   they themselves ended up rejecting.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:52.160]   And he was the chief cornerstone that they rejected, became the cornerstone that they absolutely needed to build Israel.
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:59:01.160]   So they became--the gospel became a stumbling block, a skandalon to the Jews, and foolishness to the world.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:06.160]   If you grew up in church, you probably may have forgotten,
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:10.160]   or maybe if you don't take your time and evangelize and talk to non-Christians,
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:15.160]   just how foolish the gospel sounds.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:18.160]   If you grew up in the church, you never really thought through.
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:22.160]   You just kind of like, "Oh yeah, Jesus loved me and died for me, and I became a Christian, and that's great.
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.160]   And one day when I die, I'm going to go to heaven."
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:31.160]   So you know the basics of the Christian faith, but you never seriously asked.
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:37.160]   If I told you that I have a million dollars, right, and you guys know me, right,
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:40.160]   and I told you I have a million dollars and I'm just going to give it to you,
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:44.160]   the first person who stands up right now, I'll give you a million dollars.
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:48.160]   You don't stand up. Why don't you stand up? It's a million dollars.
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:51.160]   Because you know I don't have a million dollars.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:54.160]   You've seen the car I drive, right?
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:57.160]   You know I don't have a million dollars, even though you trust me.
[00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:01.160]   Imagine going down to just random people on the street and say, "You know what?
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:05.160]   You know I have a million dollars. If you come to my house, I'll give it to you."
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:09.160]   How many people do you think will follow you because they believe you?
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:13.160]   It's hard to believe, right? It's hard to believe.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:18.160]   The message of the cross is mankind rebelled against God.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:21.160]   We're blaspheming His name.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.160]   The God of the universe who created us.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.160]   And instead of wiping us out, He has compassion.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:34.160]   And in order to save us from our own sin and our own rebellion, our own blasphemy,
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:38.160]   not only does He not condemn us, He sends His only begotten Son.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.160]   Only begotten Son. This is more than a million dollars.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:49.160]   Only begotten Son to take our place and the punishment that you and I deserve,
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:54.160]   that He took it upon Himself that if we believe Him, that He will cleanse us of our sins
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.160]   and that we're going to be in eternity.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:02.160]   Now you're in the church, so you've heard it so many times, it just sounds like, "Oh, that's a great message."
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:08.160]   Listen as a non-Christian how ridiculous that sounds.
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:13.160]   You want me to believe that? Really?
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:17.160]   God became man?
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:20.160]   Now if I told you that God got angry with the world and He wants to wipe it out,
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:25.160]   that's easier to believe. Isn't that easier to believe? Right?
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:30.160]   All-powerful God. People who aren't rebelling against Him.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:33.160]   And He chose to wipe us out.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:36.160]   Yeah, that makes more sense.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.160]   But God in the universe would give His most precious Son to die?
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.160]   To redeem sinners?
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.160]   And not only do you want us to believe that,
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:52.160]   you want us to put all our eggs in the same basket and go tell the world about this?
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:56.160]   Are you serious?
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.160]   No wonder it's foolishness to the world.
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.160]   It is foolishness to the world.
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:05.160]   If you only know the surface of what happened.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:10.160]   And I think that's a big problem with a generation of Christians
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.160]   who are biblically illiterate because they don't understand.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:17.160]   And that's why they can't bear fruit.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:20.160]   Because when you talk to non-Christians, you can't explain.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.160]   It is foolishness.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:29.160]   And when the world desires power, it's like, "Yeah, I wish God did this."
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.160]   He said they asked for wisdom.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.160]   The Jews asked for signs.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:36.160]   But we preach Christ crucified.
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:39.160]   Power of God and the wisdom of God.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.160]   You know that power?
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.160]   You know, when we think about power, right?
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.160]   Not all power is useful.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:50.160]   Power is only useful if it is directed toward the problem.
[01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:53.160]   Just like, I don't know if you've ever tried to remove a tree.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:56.160]   No matter how big it is, you can cut it all down.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.160]   But the tree trunk, it's almost impossible to dig out by yourself.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:04.160]   Especially the larger the trunk, the harder it is to take out.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:07.160]   So you actually need a tree trunk remover.
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.160]   I don't know what the technical word is,
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:12.160]   but the tree trunk remover basically has a huge drill,
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:16.160]   and you put it on top of the stump, and then it starts to drill.
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.160]   And what may have taken you a year to dig out by yourself,
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:23.160]   get all the roots, this thing does in minutes.
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:26.160]   You just turn it on, it goes, "p-p-p-p," and comes,
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.160]   and just wipes everything out, and then a tree trunk comes
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:31.160]   in little bits and pieces, and it's gone.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:34.160]   But as powerful as that is,
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:37.160]   if you're trying to demolish a building, it's useless.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:41.160]   Because that power wasn't made for that.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.160]   Same thing with wisdom.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.160]   You can have a PhD in molecular science.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:50.160]   You can be a rocket scientist with several PhDs,
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:55.160]   but it's completely useless when you're trying to communicate with your wife.
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.160]   Or with your husband.
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.160]   So no amount of knowledge is going to help you with that.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:03.160]   In fact, I remember years ago, we had a pediatrician at our church,
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:07.160]   and he went to medical school, had extra fellowship,
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:10.160]   and he was an expert in that field.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:14.160]   But they didn't have children, so when the wife first got pregnant,
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:18.160]   she was so frustrated because the doctor would never take any advice.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.160]   She's like, "You know, I do this for a living.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.160]   I'm the one who tells them about Lamas.
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.160]   I'm the one who tells them about the birth cycle."
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:27.160]   And then so she's like, "Oh," she's so frustrated because she's like,
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.160]   "Don't worry about it. I got this. I got a doctorate in this."
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:32.160]   And then they finally had a child.
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:37.160]   And then about two months into raising this infant,
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:40.160]   I remember the husband and wife came to our home,
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:43.160]   and he sat there, and this doctor was completely lost for words.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:46.160]   Basically, he hasn't slept in two months.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:48.160]   And he was just staring out into space.
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:50.160]   And at that time, we had four children in our home,
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:54.160]   and he looked at us and said, "How do you do this?"
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:58.160]   All that learning, he had head knowledge,
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:02.160]   but it was completely different once he had a child in his home.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:05.160]   He had all the right things to say until he actually had a child in his home,
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:08.160]   and he realized this was far different than what he imagined.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.160]   Obviously, that probably made him a better doctor,
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.160]   but all the knowledge in the world,
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:19.160]   if it is not geared toward the problem that you need to solve, is useless.
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.160]   It wasn't that Jesus was not performing signs.
[01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:25.160]   It wasn't that there isn't knowledge and wisdom behind what he was doing,
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:30.160]   but the primary problem with mankind was not Rome.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:34.160]   The primary problem with mankind was not lack of knowledge.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:39.160]   The Bible says, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:44.160]   The primary problem of mankind is mankind.
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:49.160]   There's a lot of debate right now about socialism, about capitalism, about communism,
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:52.160]   but in the end, it's not the system,
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.160]   because no matter what kind of system you bring in,
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:06:01.160]   if the people in that system is corrupt, they're going to corrupt no matter what they do.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:05.160]   So if you believe that if you change the system, mankind is good,
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:09.160]   and if you change the system, they'll be able to do good things.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.160]   In the end, that's what communism really is.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:14.160]   Communism basically is mankind in and of itself is good.
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:20.160]   It's the system that's corrupt that causes certain people to be rich and certain people to be poor.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:26.160]   So if you take out the system and let mankind have the opportunity to be good to other human beings,
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.160]   then they'll be good.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:33.160]   They'll naturally share with one another, work hard so that the other people can benefit from their hard labor.
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:40.160]   That's communism, and it has proven to not work.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:43.160]   Whatever your political view may be,
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:51.160]   I don't think any of you will disagree with me that people work harder when they benefit personally.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:55.160]   I remember the first time I went to China in 1993, walking into a restaurant,
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:59.160]   and at that time, it was a pure communist system.
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:03.160]   They got paid $5, $10 a month, no matter what they did,
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:07.160]   and I remember every time we walked in, they would be upset,
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:10.160]   because they had to work.
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.160]   They had to turn on the light.
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:15.160]   They would come in and slam the chopsticks on our table.
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.160]   "What do you want?"
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:20.160]   And then if we sat around talking a little bit longer than we should,
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:23.160]   they'd say, "Okay, time to get out," and they'd shut the lights off.
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:26.160]   They did the minimum that they had to do.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:31.160]   Again, whatever your political ideology is, I hope there's no communists here,
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:36.160]   but whatever political ideology is, I don't think anybody would disagree
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:41.160]   that we work harder when we are more selfishly motivated.
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:44.160]   But in the end, it's not the system.
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:48.160]   The Bible is not the system that's corrupt.
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:53.160]   No matter what leader you put in there, and no matter what system you put in,
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.160]   the corruption the Bible says is in our own heart.
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:58.160]   We've fallen short of the glory of God.
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:02.160]   Now, I remember years ago when Facebook first came out,
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:06.160]   there was a big issue about privacy.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:11.160]   I was a little bit surprised that so many people were angry
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:14.160]   about the privacy setting of Facebook.
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:17.160]   It's like, "Oh, you know, we don't own it. They own it, and they can access it.
[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.160]   They do whatever they want with their information."
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.160]   I remember surprised because when I posted things on Facebook,
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:27.160]   I was posting it on www, World Wide Web.
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:30.160]   I never thought that that was going to be private.
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.160]   You know what I mean?
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:34.160]   Maybe that's a generational thing that you put it on the Internet.
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:39.160]   I just assume it's not mine, or else I wouldn't put it up there.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:43.160]   But I realize that younger generation is different.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:48.160]   But why are you so concerned about your privacy?
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.160]   Why are you so concerned about your privacy?
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:54.160]   What if somebody had a million dollars that they just don't need,
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:59.160]   and they're looking on the Internet to find worthy people who are in need,
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:05.160]   and they want to give you some money, and you won't let them into your Facebook?
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.160]   Aren't you concerned about that?
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.160]   If you're in need, just put it out there.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:13.160]   It's like, "Hey, I need $100."
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:16.160]   And what if somebody wants to give it to you?
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:20.160]   But because of your privacy setting, you protect your identity.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:23.160]   They can't come to--aren't you concerned about that?
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:29.160]   That you're going to miss out on the goodness of mankind?
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:32.160]   Probably not, right?
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:36.160]   No, we protect their privacy because we don't trust anybody.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:39.160]   Maybe there is one guy like that, but majority of the people, you're concerned
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.160]   that they're going to take whatever information you have,
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.160]   and they're going to be up to no good.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.160]   Let me ask you.
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:55.160]   Is it harder to make friends when you're older or easier?
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.160]   It's much harder.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.160]   It's much easier to make friends when you're younger.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:02.160]   When you have a child, and you take a kid, and you throw them into the playground,
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:06.160]   they play with each other, and they're best friends next day.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.160]   "Yeah, I want to be your best friend." "Me too."
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.160]   And then they grow up together.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:15.160]   That don't happen in your 30s, in your 40s.
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.160]   It's much harder. Why?
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:22.160]   Why is it harder to make friends when you're older?
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:24.160]   Because we don't trust people.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:28.160]   It's years of being burned and being disappointed.
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:34.160]   I don't know anybody--they're older, and they're more open and generous.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:38.160]   They become more grizzled and more careful and more skeptical of people
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:44.160]   because we've all been burned because we've had enough time to experience mankind.
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.160]   Look at the Internet.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:50.160]   I mean, the technology that we have, I mean, the advancement of technology
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.160]   that made our life easier.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:57.160]   I was just thinking the other day, like, how did we ever get anywhere without GPS?
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:00.160]   Remember, some of you guys, when we didn't have--we had to look up the map,
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:04.160]   and if you didn't have that map, you had to go by memory.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.160]   And I remember one time I was coming home from somewhere,
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:09.160]   and I was probably about five minutes away from home,
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.160]   and I didn't realize I was lost until 20 minutes later.
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:14.160]   It says, "Welcome to San Bernardino."
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.160]   And it's like, oh, my gosh, I've been going the wrong way for, like, 30 minutes.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:20.160]   And I had to turn the car back around, go back home.
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:23.160]   I was only five minutes away from home.
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:26.160]   I was daydreaming, and then I just wasn't paying attention.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:29.160]   But how do we get anywhere without GPS?
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:33.160]   So all this advancement of mankind--and think about all the access
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:35.160]   that we have on the Internet.
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:40.160]   Any question that I have, I can say, "Google."
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.160]   When did Genghis Khan live?
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.160]   How many children did he have?
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.160]   Did he have any Christian influence?
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.160]   Like, boom, right there, on the tip of your finger.
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:51.160]   Well, all the advancement of technology and everything that we have--
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:56.160]   you know what the top 10 visited sites in the Internet is?
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:59.160]   All porn sites.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:02.160]   Top 10.
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.160]   Top 10.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:08.160]   So all the technology and the things that we do is dictated
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:15.160]   because the biggest funds-generating, money-generating industry is pornography.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:21.160]   More than Netflix, more than Hollywood, more than NBA and NFL.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:24.160]   It's pornography.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:28.160]   So the root problem of mankind is mankind himself.
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.160]   That no matter how much we fix, no matter how many laws that we pass
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:38.160]   to taper the racism, in the end, racism is not a system in and of itself.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.160]   It's the man in the system.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:45.160]   And that's what Jesus says that he came to deal with.
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.160]   He can overthrow the Roman government.
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:50.160]   He can give everybody a PhD in knowledge.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:55.160]   But the root cause of the problem of mankind is mankind himself.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:59.160]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:03.160]   God had intended you and I to be in the presence of his glory
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:05.160]   and to give him worship.
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:09.160]   There's a reason why Governor Newsom made entertainment essential.
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:12.160]   Why he said, you know, religious gatherings are not essential.
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:16.160]   Entertainment is essential because entertainment is a form of worship
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:19.160]   to a non-Christian.
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:23.160]   You and I were made for worship because in the period that you and I are in,
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:25.160]   in darkness, people are depressed.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.160]   They can't go to work.
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:27.160]   They're having financial problems.
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:32.160]   But at least if you are entertained, you can forget for a period.
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:34.160]   You can find peace for a period.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.160]   You can find joy for a period.
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:42.160]   So it is a non-Christian's way of dealing with the problem of mankind
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:45.160]   to temporarily forget your problems.
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.160]   And so they have declared it essential because they're not Christians.
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:49.160]   They don't understand.
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:52.160]   But the very reason why you and I are here and all over the world
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:56.160]   celebrating the birth of Christ is because Christ came to deal
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:00.160]   with the central problem of mankind, is our own sins.
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:03.160]   It's because we have fallen short of God's glory.
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:10.160]   Until we are restored back to his glory, we will always be trapped.
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:16.160]   We will always be trapped seeking temporary glory in something else.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:22.160]   That's why we get so hooked on making celebrities and idols and movies.
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:26.160]   In and of itself, they're not evil.
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:29.160]   But mankind, who does not recognize his primary problem,
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:35.160]   will constantly go to temporary fixes for temporary life.
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:38.160]   But Jesus said that he came to give life and give this life abundantly.
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:42.160]   And until our eyes are open to the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:47.160]   we will always be bound by whatever catches our attention.
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:50.160]   But here's the problem.
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:55.160]   We've fallen short of God's glory, and mankind, because we do not see his glory,
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:58.160]   we cannot worship him.
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.160]   That's why Christ came.
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:05.160]   That's why Christ came, because he wanted to restore us back to his glory.
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:08.160]   Hebrews 1.3 says, "He is the radiance of the glory
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:11.160]   and the exact representation of his nature."
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:15.160]   So he came in human form representing God's glory.
[01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:18.160]   2 Corinthians 4.6, "For God who said, 'Let light shine out of darkness,'
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:22.160]   is the one who has shone in his own heart to give the light of knowledge
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:27.160]   of the glory of God in the face of Christ."
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:33.160]   Because we were separated from God's glory, Christ came to reflect his glory
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:36.160]   and then to bring us to him.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:39.160]   In John 17.1, when Jesus was headed toward the cross, he says,
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.160]   "Father, the hour has come.
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:46.160]   Glorify your Son, that the Son may glorify you."
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:53.160]   So Christ crucified is to magnify the glory of God
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:59.160]   and to cover us with his blood so that we may enter into his glory.
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:04.160]   Because you and I, in our own sins, cannot stand before a holy God
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.160]   because he is so pure.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:10.160]   It's just like going to the nuclear bomb center.
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:12.160]   It's just pure energy.
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.160]   But that pure energy, if we're not protected, will kill us.
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.160]   And that's what the Bible says.
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:21.160]   A man in his sinful state cannot enter to see his glory.
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:25.160]   And that's what's the dilemma of mankind, that you and I have been separated
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:29.160]   from the ultimate object of worship, the very reason why you and I were created.
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:33.160]   And that's why Christ came in his power, in his wisdom,
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:40.160]   that he offered himself to cover us and to impute his righteousness on us
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:45.160]   so that we may enter his throne of grace with confidence.
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:49.160]   And that's why the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian is described.
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:53.160]   A non-Christian is somebody who the enemy has blinded
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:57.160]   so that they do not see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:00.160]   Where Christians are people who, covered by the blood of Christ,
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:06.160]   we are constantly gazing at his glory, and we're living in eternity in worship.
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:10.160]   Those of you who've never experienced true worship before God,
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:13.160]   if you're a sports fan, I mean, it's a crude analogy,
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:16.160]   but it's the closest thing that we can come to.
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:23.160]   The euphoria that you experience when something beyond you is in your presence,
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:26.160]   you break out into worship.
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:32.160]   Something beyond you, that's something that causes you to be awed.
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:37.160]   If you're a fan of Lakers or baseball, and they win the championship,
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:41.160]   and you see the struggle, and at the end, when you are observing,
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:43.160]   you did nothing.
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:46.160]   What did you get out of that? They don't give you a free hat.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:49.160]   You don't get a stake of that team.
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:52.160]   But you would spend hundreds, maybe even thousands of dollars,
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:56.160]   buying their clothing, identifying with what?
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:58.160]   What do you get out of it?
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:07.160]   Joy, life, fellowship with other people who feel the same, community,
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:12.160]   simply because you observed something magnificent before you.
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:15.160]   There's a reason why people don't pay money to go see middle-aged men
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:22.160]   play basketball, because it's not glorious.
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:27.160]   So we get that kind of joy from watching sports.
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:30.160]   Imagine what we fell from.
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:34.160]   Imagine what he's trying to restore us back to
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:40.160]   when our eyes become open to the glory of our Father.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:43.160]   Greatest truth, greatest power, greatest love
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:48.160]   that you and I could possibly imagine in Christ.
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:52.160]   That's the invitation of Christmas.
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:56.160]   Christ came so that he can walk on earth,
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:59.160]   so that he can become a sympathetic high priest,
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.160]   and he made the invitation.
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:05.160]   All who are weary and heavy laden, he says, "I will give you rest."
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:11.160]   Those of you who are moving around, seeking to find purpose in life,
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:15.160]   wanting something to give your life to,
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:20.160]   all of that may be because you've been separated from the author of life.
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:25.160]   So this Christmas, we celebrate not simply the miracle
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:30.160]   of God becoming man, but his sacrifice,
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.160]   that he who knew no sin became sin,
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:36.160]   so that you and I may become the righteousness of God.
[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:38.160]   That same invitation that he gave 2,000 years ago
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:43.160]   is the same invitation that continues to be repeated until he comes.
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:45.160]   If you confess your sins, he is faithful and just
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:48.160]   to forgive of all your unrighteousness.
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:50.160]   If you would simply come before him,
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.160]   acknowledge that you are a sinner in need
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:55.160]   of the blood of Christ to cover you,
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:20:00.160]   and he will open your eyes to what you have fallen from,
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:04.160]   that he wants to restore you to worship him in spirit and in truth.
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:08.160]   So this morning, I encourage you
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:12.160]   that if any part of what's been said made any sense to you,
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:14.160]   to just come before God honestly and say,
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:19.160]   "Lord, I've fallen from you. Would you open my eyes?
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:21.160]   Lord, I'm a sinner.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:23.160]   I've been trying to fix my marriage.
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.160]   I've been trying to fix the world.
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:27.160]   I've been trying to fix my kids,
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:30.160]   but I recognize the greatest problem is me.
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:33.160]   And the only power and the only wisdom that can change me
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:36.160]   is Christ crucified."
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:39.160]   So if you would just come before God honestly and say,
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:43.160]   "Lord, forgive me of my sins," he will forgive you.
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:47.160]   So I pray, again, after the service, we'll have a place back, you know,
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.160]   where our outreach team will be there,
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:52.160]   and some of the pastors will be there to answer some of your questions.
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:57.160]   So I invite some of you who are interested in that to go there right after service,
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:21:00.160]   and they'll give you the help that you need.
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:03.160]   But the message of Christmas is not just for, again, non-Christians.
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.160]   It's for Christians.
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.160]   If you've been at church all your life,
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:12.160]   and you acknowledge the power,
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:15.160]   but that power never affected you,
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:18.160]   you've gained so much knowledge,
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:23.160]   but your eyes have never truly been open to the wisdom of God,
[01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:26.160]   that maybe today, maybe this Christmas season,
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:29.160]   take a step back and ask yourself,
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.160]   "Do I know this power?
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:35.160]   Do I know this wisdom of God?"
[01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:39.160]   So that this Christmas season will not just be a religious thing that we do and pass by,
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.160]   but to really fix our eyes upon Christ.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:44.160]   Let's pray.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:51.160]   Heavenly Father, I pray that the truth of the gospel
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:55.160]   would bear much fruit, Lord God, especially in this season.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:59.160]   And we know that there's a lot of people around the world seeking for answers,
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:03.160]   that even in the midst of this pandemic and craziness, Lord God,
[01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.160]   we know that you have a purpose.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:09.160]   So we pray this season that you would restore and strengthen the church,
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:12.160]   help us to realize, Lord God, why we are here,
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:15.160]   to be a light in this dark world.
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:19.160]   We pray, Lord God, for our friends and family, Lord, that have joined us today,
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:23.160]   that may have understood the gospel for the first time.
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:28.160]   Lord, I pray that it would not end simply with more knowledge,
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.160]   but that you would draw them to yourself.
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:35.160]   And as you saved us because you are a God who loves us,
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:38.160]   that you would draw them to yourself.
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:41.160]   And as you saved us because you loved us and you drew us to yourself,
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:47.160]   we pray, Lord God, that you would bring salvation to them as well.
[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:52.160]   So we pray for the power of the Holy Spirit to convict us of our sins,
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:57.160]   convict us, Lord God, of the hope that we have in the name of Jesus Christ,
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:02.160]   that you would call us and bring us, Lord, eternal fellowship in life with you.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:06.160]   We praise you, we love you. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:11.160]   We all stand up together for our closing song.
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:15.160]   As we close, let us clap together as we sing this last song.
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:18.160]   I know we're not the biggest fans of clapping here at Berean,
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:23.160]   but for everybody here, for everybody outside, for everybody tuning in online,
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:27.160]   let us clap together as we remember and rejoice the birth of our Savior Jesus
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:29.160]   and the salvation brought to us.
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:32.160]   Let's sing "Heart, the Herald Angels Sing."
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:41.160]   [music]
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:43.160]   Heart, the Herald.
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:51.160]   The Herald angels sing, glory to the new-born King.
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:59.160]   Peace on earth and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled.
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:08.160]   Joyful all ye nations rise, join the triumph of the skies.
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:17.160]   With angelic hosts proclaim, Christ is born in Bethlehem.
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:27.160]   Heart, the Herald angels sing, glory to the new-born King.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:32.160]   [music]
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.160]   Christ by highest.
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:43.160]   Christ by highest, and adored, Christ the everlasting Lord.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:51.160]   In His hand He opened the lost and love of earth.
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:56.160]   He filled His flesh, the Godhead see.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:00.160]   Healed the inquiring, the empty.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:09.160]   He has never yet declared, Jesus our new-born King.
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:19.160]   Heart, the Herald angels sing, glory to the new-born King.
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:24.160]   [music]
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.160]   Hail the head for Prince.
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:31.160]   Hail the head for Prince of Peace.
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:35.160]   Hail the Son of Righteousness.
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:44.160]   He brought a life to all creation, risen with healing in His feet.
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:48.160]   Cloudy lades, glory found.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:53.160]   Born that night, no more may die.
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:26:01.160]   Born to raise the sun down, and born to give the second light.
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:11.160]   Heart, the Herald angels sing, glory to the new-born King.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:16.160]   [music]
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:19.160]   Just a voice in His body, please.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:24.160]   Cloudy lades, glory found.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:29.160]   Born that night, no more may die.
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:39.160]   Born to raise the suns of earth, and born to give the second birth.
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:51.160]   Heart, the Herald angels sing, glory to the new-born King.
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:53.160]   Let's pray.
[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:55.160]   Reading from Colossians 119-20.
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:27:00.160]   For it was the Father's good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him.
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:03.160]   And through Him to reconcile all things to Himself.
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:06.160]   Having made peace through the blood of His cross, through Him,
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:10.160]   I say whether things on earth or things in heaven.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:11.160]   Romans 5.8.
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:14.160]   But God demonstrates His own love toward us,
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:18.160]   in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.160]   And then John 5.24.
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:21.160]   Truly, truly, I say to you,
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:26.160]   He who hears my word and believes Him who sent me has eternal life.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:31.160]   And does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:34.160]   Lord, we pray that the power of your word would go forth,
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:36.160]   and the seeds that you've planted would bear fruit,
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:40.160]   and will not return until it has accomplished the purpose that you have ordained.
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:45.160]   So we pray, Father God, that you would help us to be the light that you've called us to be.
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:47.160]   That Christ may be exalted.
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:50.160]   That the hope of Christ, Lord God, may be known wherever we are.
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:52.160]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:57.160]   God sent His Son
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:04.160]   They called Him Jesus
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:08.160]   He came to earth
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:13.160]   He left for good
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:19.160]   He lived and died
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:25.160]   To buy my borrowed
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:31.160]   An empty grave is there to
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:36.160]   Save your head
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:42.160]   As He lives
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:47.160]   I confess to borrow
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:52.160]   Because He lives
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:58.160]   All fear is gone
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:04.160]   Because I know
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:09.160]   He owns the future
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:14.160]   And life is worth the living
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:19.160]   Just because He lives
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:21.160]   Amen.
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:24.160]   So if we can have this side go out that way,
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:28.160]   and then this side just give it a minute and let them clear out outside first before we go.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:31.160]   And then again, those of you who are visiting us and you have some questions,
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:36.160]   please go to the, I think the outreach booth that's been set up outside,
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:39.160]   and I think they'll have some instructions and things outside.
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:40.160]   Okay?
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:50.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
