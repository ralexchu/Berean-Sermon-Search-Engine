[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:43.000]   as we reflect and hope and pray that
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.500]   as we sing these songs, especially this one,
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.000]   we can really understand and appreciate
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   God's amazing love that he would die for us.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   So as we sing not just this song,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.500]   but every song week to week,
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.000]   we hope and pray that the lyrics

[00:22:54.580 --> 00:23:01.000]   - Good morning.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Welcome to Berean Community Church.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Those of you who are here and those of you who are online,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   let me get to a few announcements before we get started.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   But before I get to the announcements, again,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   thank you for praying for Pastor Peter Chung.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   He had a successful surgery on Friday,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   and then so we texted with him a couple times.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   And again, this is kind of like the last stage,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   and hopefully he'll be back with us soon.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   So please continue to pray for him so that he can recover
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   and physically be able to come and join us in our fellowship.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   And Pastor Peter Chung is probably
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   the happiest cancer patient I've ever met.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   You know, he's always smiling and jolly.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   But, you know, obviously he needs to heal,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   so please continue to keep him in your prayers.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   So he's at the hospital, so no one's able to visit him
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   because of the COVID restrictions.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   So I think he said he's going to be moved on Monday back home.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   So please, again, continue to keep him in your prayers.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   This coming Friday, we have a prayer meeting at church at 7:30.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Try to come a little bit earlier,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   and we're going to have the inside and out,
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   depending on when you come.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   And again, you'll have a choice in whether you sit here or outside.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   But because of that, we won't have our normal Bible study.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   So our weekday Bible study and home group Bible study
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   won't be taking place this week.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   And also for the leaders' meeting that takes place on Monday,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   we will not be having that this week.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   We'll pick that up the following week.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Also for the Berean seeds,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   so if you have children who were born in August 31, 2018--
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Is that 2015?
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   So September 1, 2015 to August 31, 2018.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   So if your child falls into that category,
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   the seeds department is going to be opening up for them
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   starting from next Sunday.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   So just like you would with your other children,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   just drop them off before you come to service
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   if you have children at that age.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   All right.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Other than that, let's take some time to pray for the offering,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   and then we'll give you an opportunity to give online
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   or physically in the back.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Let's pray.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Heavenly Father, we just want to thank you
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   for your continued goodness and grace in our lives.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Lord, you truly deserve all that we have,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   all our might, thought, strength.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Help us, Lord God, not to simply put in our time,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   but to really give you worship in spirit and in truth.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   We ask that you would enrich our hearts, Lord God,
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   that we would do more than just sing,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   but that we would cry out, Lord God, in thanksgiving
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   for what you've done.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   We pray that even the offering,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   it would be an expression of our hearts,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   not just financially, but an act of worship that we give to you.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   May it be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   for the sake of your name.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Amen.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   [piano playing]
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Let's all stand together as we sing.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   [piano playing]
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   [piano playing]
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Here is love, vast as the ocean,
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   loving kindness as the flood.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   When the prince of life, our ransom,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   shed for us his precious blood.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Who is love will not remember,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   who can cease to sing his praise.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   He can never be forgotten
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   throughout heaven's eternal day.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   [music]
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   On the mount of crucifixion,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   fountains open deep and wide.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Through the floodgates of God's mercy,
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   flowed a vast and gracious tide.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Grace and love like mighty rivers
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   poured incense and from above.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Heaven's peace and perfect justice
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   kissed the guilty world in love.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   [music]
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Here is love, here is love that conquered evil.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Christ the first born from the grave.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Death has failed to be found equal
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   to the life of him who stayed.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   In the valley of our darkness
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   dawned his everlasting light.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Perfect love in glorious grace
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   has redeemed us from our sin.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   [music]
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   [music]
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   No love is higher, no love is wider.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   No love is deeper, no love is truer.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   No love is higher, no love is wider.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   No love is like your love, O Lord.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   No love is higher, no love is wider.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   No love is deeper, no love is truer.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   No love is higher, no love is wider.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   No love is like your love, O Lord.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Here is love, vast as the heavens.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Countless as the stars above
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   are the souls that he has ransomed.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Precious daughter's treasured son.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   We are called to peace forever
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   on a love beyond our time.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Glorious Father, Son, and Spirit,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   now with man are intertwined.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   We are called to peace forever
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   on a love beyond our time.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   Glorious Father, Son, and Spirit,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   now with man are intertwined.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Amen.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   [piano]
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   What love could, what love could remember
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   no wrongs we have done.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Omniscient, all-knowing, he counts not their sum.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Our sins they are many, his mercy is more.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   [piano]
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   What patience would wait as we constantly roam.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   What Father so tender is calling us home.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   He welcomes the weakest, the vilest, the poor.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Our sins they are many, his mercy is more.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Praise the Lord, his mercy is more.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Stronger than darkness, pure every more.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Our sins they are many, his mercy is more.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   [piano]
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   The riches of kindness, he lavished on us.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   His blood was the payment, his life was the cost.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   We stood 'neath the dead, we could never afford.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Our sins they are many, his mercy is more.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Praise the Lord, his mercy is more.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Stronger than darkness, pure every more.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Our sins they are many, his mercy is more.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Praise the Lord, his mercy is more.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   Stronger than darkness, pure every more.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Our sins they are many, his mercy is more.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   Stronger than darkness, pure every more.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Our sins they are many, his mercy is more.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Amen. You may be seated.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   [piano]
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 11.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   We're going to be reading from verse 27 through 29.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   So this is going to be the part two of what we started last week.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   As we said, Moses has very clear, distinct divisions in his life.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   For the first 40 years he was in the Pharaoh's house.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   The next 40 years he was out in the desert shepherding.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   And then the 40 years of wandering the desert as God used him to deliver
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   the nation of Israel from Pharaoh.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   So we're at the third part this week.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   And so we're going to be looking at what it says in verse 27 through 29.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   for he endured a seeing him who is unseen.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   By faith they passed through the Red Sea,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   as though they were passing through dry land,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Let's pray.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your continued grace.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   We pray that the worship that we give you would truly be something meaningful
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   in our hearts that we offer up to you,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   that we would worship you not simply with time, but our whole heart.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Help us, Lord, to know the significance of these words
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   that it may mold us, move us, change us, Lord God,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   according to your purpose and will.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   I think in the recent days, most of you or many of you
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   probably heard the story of what happened with Rabbi Zacharias.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   And I know that it's affected the Christian world
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   because he was a man that was celebrated and did many good works for decades.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   So if you don't know the story behind that,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   basically he's a man who God used for apologetics
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   and wrote many good books and had seminars,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   and many, many people would credit him for bringing them to Christ
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   and recently found out after he passed away
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   that he completely lived a double life,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   that he lived a life that was filled with sin,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   he was a sexual predator, and it was not simply a mistake.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   It looked like it was calculated,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   and it didn't really seem like he made much attempt to cover it up.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   We have a tendency, like it says in Romans 1,
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   to put people on pedestals,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   and it's not that the Bible does teach us to honor and to submit and to remember,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   and all those things are important,
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   but at the same time, our primary sin that is mentioned in Romans 1,
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   we have a tendency to worship the creation rather than the creator.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   And sometimes we do that to the point where
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   when somebody that we looked up to fails that way,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   it could really destroy people's faith when we do that.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   No one is meant to be worshipped.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   To honor, respected, yes, but not to be worshipped.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   No one is to take the place where our faith is dependent upon another man.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   We need to be careful that even as we study through the Scripture,
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   we have a tendency to highlight the achievements of man.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Even though we say in passing that God is sovereign and he does what he does,
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   but we can look at what Moses did.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   We can look at what David did, and I've heard so many sermons about how David,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   while he was shepherding, he cleaned up his rocks
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   and how he was chasing away wolves,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   and that was that skill that God needed to slay Goliath.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   And so we need to hone in our skills
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   so that God can use us for his glory.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   The point of the story is not that at all.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   We can get off track in our tendency to kind of highlight the achievements of man
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   and the intellect of man and our talents of man
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   and then completely forget the point of the whole story.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Moses, if you can put the picture up.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   The next slide.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   When we think of Moses, this is usually the picture that we have.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   That's probably Charlton Heston, for those of you who know who he is.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   In Hollywood, this story of Egypt's deliverance and the ten plagues,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   it's so prominent, especially in the American culture.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Most people know about this, Christian or non-Christian.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   So Hollywood movies were made of it, and so when we think of Moses,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   we think of this strong, confident, fearless leader that God used to deliver Israel.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   In fact, that's how it starts. In verse 27, it says,
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   "By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   for he endured it, seeing him who was unseen."
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Not fearing. So he's described as a fearless man.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   And remember who he's going against.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   He's going against Pharaoh, the strongest, most powerful man
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   who was basically the king of the most powerful nation.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   And here's this shepherd who's been shepherding for 40 years,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   and God raises him up to challenge him, saying, "Let my people go."
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   Think how audacious that is, that this shepherd for 40 years
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   would stand in front of Pharaoh and demand, "Let my people go."
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   And he said Moses was fearless when he did that.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   We could easily look at that and say, "Wow, that's why he's celebrated,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   and that's why he's known as the greatest leader of Israel."
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   And we need to emulate him.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   But if you look carefully at the word of God,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   it doesn't present himself that way.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   In fact, if you remember in Acts 7, 24, in verse 25,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   Stephen gives the sermon about that particular event
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   when he is chased out of Egypt out of fear.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   If you remember, he came out and he saw a dispute,
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   and the Egyptians, an Egyptian guard,
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   and in order to protect his Hebrew brother, he ends up killing him.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   And he comes out a second time, thinking that maybe God was going to use him
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   to deliver Israel, in verse 25 it says,
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   "And he supposed that his brethren understood that God was granting them
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   deliverance through him, but they did not understand."
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   So he came out thinking, because he grew up all his life with prophecy
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   that he was the chosen one, and that's why he was in Pharaoh's house.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   That's why God was raising him up.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   And finally, when he came out and he confronted the Egyptian guard,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   and he came out and was trying to intervene in the dispute of these two Hebrews,
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   I think he thought that that was the time that God was going to use him to deliver.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   Just like the prophecy, just like he was told since he was a child.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   But when they turned against him and said, "Are you going to kill us too?
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   Who are you?"
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   It says in verse 14, Exodus 2, 14, but he said,
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   "Who made you a prince or judge over us?
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Are you intending to kill me as you killed the Egyptians?"
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   Then Moses was afraid and said, "Surely the matter has become known."
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   Well, who wrote this? Because in 27 he says he's fearless,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   and then here it says he was afraid.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   In Exodus 3, 10 through 11, after spending 40 years on the desert,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   God finally calls him, tells him who he is, and says,
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   "Now is the time. I want you to go."
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   And then this is how Moses responds in verse 10.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   "Come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh so that you may bring my people,
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   the sons of Israel, out of Egypt."
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   But Moses said to God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   and that I should bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?"
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   Remember, 40 years ago, he was willing,
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   and he was expecting because he grew up all his life with that prophecy over him.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   But now it's not because he's ignorant.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   It's because it failed, at least in his mind.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   So why is it going to happen this way? Who am I?
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   He doesn't seem like a man of faith, at least not here.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   He doesn't seem like a courageous man with the staff up in the sky,
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   this fearless leader that Israelites were able to get behind.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   Exodus 4, 1, Moses said, "What if they will not believe me or listen to what I say?
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   For they may say, 'The Lord has not appeared to you.'"
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   And then again in Exodus 4, 10 through 15, God keeps on pushing him.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   "I didn't call you because you are articulate. I didn't call you because I needed you.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   I called you because I called you."
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   Then Moses said to the Lord, "Please, Lord, I have never been eloquent,
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   neither recently nor the time past, nor since you have spoken to your servant,
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   for I am slow of speech and slow of tongue."
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Please, Lord, he's begging, and the Lord won't let it go
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   because God anointed him.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   But he genuinely doesn't want to do this because he was fearful.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   "Who am I?" I mean, think about that.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   He's talking to God.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   He's not just talking to anybody.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   God is audibly speaking to Moses, saying that, "I'm going to use you."
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   And he says, "Well, who am I?"
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   Verse 12, "Now then, go, and I even will be with your mouth
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   and teach you what you are to say."
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   And it said, "Please, Lord, now send the message by whomever you will."
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Then the anger of the Lord burned against Moses.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   Does that sound like the fearless leader that you see in verse 27?
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   Now, what happened?
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   And who wrote Exodus?
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   Moses did.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   And I know that he was dictating by the Holy Spirit, but Moses was writing this,
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   and as he was writing this, did he just get it wrong?
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   Whoever wrote Hebrews, did they not read Exodus?
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   Maybe these are two separate authors, and they don't know anything about each other,
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   and so one describes him as this fearful man who had very little faith
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   and was begging God, "Please don't let me do it!"
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   That's how it's described for us.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   And then in Exodus 5, 21-23,
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   when he finally goes, and literally, God is twisting his arms,
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   "You better go."
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   "I made your mouth. You go."
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   And then he goes, and then they have the first encounter,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   and Pharaoh's heart gets hardened.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   It says God keeps hardening his heart because he wanted to demonstrate his power.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   And then the Israelites do the same thing.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   They turn against Moses and say, "I told you!
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   Because of you, Pharaoh is making it harder on us!"
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   And so in 5.21 it says that they said to them, "May the Lord look upon you and judge you,
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   for you have made us odious in Pharaoh's sight and in the sight of his servants,
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   and he has put a sword in their hand to kill us."
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   So it didn't turn out the way it's just like the first time.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   They didn't embrace him. They didn't celebrate him.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   So he goes back to God in verse 22, "Then Moses returned to the Lord and said,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   'O Lord, why have you brought harm to this people?
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   Why did you ever send me?
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has done harm to this people,
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   and you have not delivered your people at all.'"
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   And he still lived.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   He's saying this all to God.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   God appears to him, and he's complaining to God.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   At this point, he's more afraid of the Israelites.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   He's more afraid of Pharaoh than God himself.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Does that sound like verse 27?
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   "By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king."
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   It sure sounds like he was fearful of the wrath.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   He was fearful not only of the wrath, but of their opinion.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   Exodus 6.11-12, "Go tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to tell,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   'Let the sons of Israel go out of this land.'
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   But Moses spoke before the Lord, saying, 'Behold, the sons of Israel have not listened to me.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   How then will Pharaoh listen to me, for I am unskilled in speech?'"
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   So is that that guy on the staff?
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   Would you draw him based upon this text?
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   Would you draw that guy? That's the guy?
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   Maybe next time somebody draws Moses, it would be like, "Please, please."
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   "Don't let me do it."
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   Because that's the way it's presented to us in Exodus.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   Moses is not painted this way.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   In fact, remember we said Moses is described as the humblest man on earth.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   It's like, "Oh, that's a humble brag. I'm the humblest of the universe."
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   I genuinely think he meant that.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   And what he meant by that was he was humbled.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   He was afraid.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   He was scared.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   He was resistant.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   Maybe even disobedient.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   And I think that's what he meant.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Because he saw that. He encountered God and he's arguing with God.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   "Will you really deliver? Is this really going to happen?
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   How can you, somebody like me?"
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   As God was showing him miracles, he was doubting and questioning.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   But why does it have in verse 27 that he was not fearing the wrath of God?
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   At some point in this deliverance story, Moses does get courage.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   At some point, Moses becomes that deliverer.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   And at some point, he is that man who raised up the staff and God uses him.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   But that's not how it started.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   He was not fearful.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   And the description of what happened, it just says simply,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   he saw the unseen God.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   That's what it says. That's all it says.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   He endured.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   Meaning he did what God told him to do. He endured.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   And seeing him who is unseen. And that's it.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   That's what changed him.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   I've heard so many stories about how God used him in 40 years
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   and built up courage and trained him and spoke to him.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   And so he became this man of God when he showed up.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   And that's why he took him out into the wilderness.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   And that's our tendency to elevate man's work.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   That if we just do this, if we said this, and if we did that,
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   and if we had the right people and the right money with the right training,
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   we can get the right things done.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   That's our natural tendency to think we just elevate man's work
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   and forget that what happened here with Moses was simply,
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   here's a weak man who was fearful, who encountered the living God.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   What changed him was not years of discipling,
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   years of training, years of discipline.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   He met the right people, did the right things with the right program.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   He just encountered God.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   And so when he's at the burning bush, he's like,
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   "Well, if I go, what do I tell them?"
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   Exodus 3.14, God said, "I am who I am."
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   He says, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'I am has sent me to you.'"
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   I am. I don't come from anybody else. I'm not created.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   He is self-existing, self-reliant, omnipotent, all-powerful.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   Tell him Yahweh has sent you.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   And all he tells him is, "I will be with you."
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   Now remember, this is Pharaoh.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   Other kings would be terrified to go to Pharaoh.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   The strongest of men would be terrified to be in the presence of Pharaoh.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   So humanly speaking, we can understand why he was terrified.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   But the only strength that he gives him, only comfort that he gives him,
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   is that when you go, "I will be with you."
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   "I will be with you."
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   He doesn't say, "Here's a list of things to memorize, and make sure you say this."
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   When he does this, do this.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   He doesn't say, "No, I will be with you. Just go."
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   "When I say to speak, you speak.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   When I say to do this, you do this. Just go."
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   You know, we think about the Great Commission.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   In Matthew 28, where God is sending out his disciples,
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   and so many people have memorized that passage,
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   "Go make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you."
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   But the real power behind the Great Commission is what comes before and what comes after.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   So we have a tendency to memorize Scripture.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   We've got to go.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   What is our strategy? What is our five-year vision?
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   What is our ten-year vision?
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   What is our discipleship program?
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   How are we going to raise up leaders?
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   And we have all of these great programs.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   And there's nothing wrong with any of that.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   But we pour our energy into human ingenuity,
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   but the real power behind that is prior to him saying,
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   So therefore, go."
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   And then he says at the end, what did he say?
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   "Lo, I am with you to the end of the age."
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   So the power behind the Great Commission is his authority and his presence with us,
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   not our ingenuity.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   That's why in Acts 1:8, when the disciples were ready to go,
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   he says, "Don't go, because you don't have the power.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   When the Holy Spirit comes upon you, you will have power,
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, to the end of the age."
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   And God prepared people to go.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   Everywhere Apostle Paul went, those people who were at Pentecost,
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   in fear of persecution, as they were running, they were sharing the gospel.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   So when Apostle Paul started his journey going to these places,
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   these Christians were already there, already sharing their testimonies.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   That didn't happen because of great planning or discipleship.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   They were running in fear of their life, and God was planting seeds already by his power
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   because that's what he said he was going to do.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   Our natural tendency is if a church is successful there,
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   if that man seems to be bearing fruit, we go and take notes and do what he did.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   Because we think if we copy what they're doing, we can have the same success.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   And so people write books and seminars, "This is what we did.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   This is how we teach. This is how our program--this is what we do."
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   And then people just copy that, and then we regurgitate what that man is doing,
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   and then we just happen to do it here.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   Because that's our natural tendency, to worship the creation rather than the creator.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   Moses' fearlessness did not come because of great training.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   If anything, for 40 years out in the desert, what do you think he learned?
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   Forty years.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   What part of the--humanly speaking, you could say, "Well, God's raising up to be this great leader,
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   so he learned this by shepherding sheep.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   He learned this by attacking wolves, and God used that
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   because when he went against Pharaoh, Pharaoh was the wolf.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   Foolish.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   What was he doing for 40 years?
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   Moses came out--remember, before he went out to the desert, he came out like the ruler.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   He came out--he even killed an Egyptian, and he thought, "They're going to come behind me.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   Now God's going to raise me up."
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   And then he throws him out to the desert for 40 years.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   What do you think he learned for 40 years?
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   Shepherds were the lowliest of professions.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   He went from the highest to the lowest.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   If there's anything that he learned in the 40 years, to empty himself.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   He got humbled.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   He got humbled.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   And that's why the Bible says, "If you want to be used for noble purposes,"
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   what does the Bible tell us in Timothy?
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   To get rid of ignoble things.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   He doesn't say fill yourself, right?
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   Like read a lot of books.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   There's nothing with any of that, okay?
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   But that's not where the power is.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   Our natural tendency to think if we get the right people doing the right thing,
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   that God's going to bless it.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   But all we're commanded to do is to be emptied.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   The greatest hindrance to the work of God
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   is not that we don't have the right people in the right place.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   It's typically we have the wrong people in the wrong place.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   Or sometimes wrong people in the right place.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   It's ourselves. We get in the way.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   That's why if you look at John 15,
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   when it says, "You can't bear fruit unless you abide in me."
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   And then you know why it's so important to abide?
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   Verse 7.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   Because if you abide in me, my words abide in you.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   Ask whatever you wish, he will do it.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   That's why he says to abide.
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   Not so that you can be this prayer warrior and I'm going to do mighty things.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   Because when you abide, if you abide in him, his word abides in you,
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   you have more effective prayer.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   That's what he says.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   So the power is not in our abiding.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   It's in our abiding we have more effective prayer.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   Like God will do it.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   See, his power came simply because he saw God.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   And even the 10 plagues was to demonstrate to Israel
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   and to demonstrate to Egypt who God really is.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   He didn't just say, "I am who I am."
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   He was going to show them.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   He was going to show them that God is above every God.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   So every one of these plagues, the Nile turning into blood,
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   God of--Isis was one of their goddesses that was a god of the Nile,
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   and he turns it into blood.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   The frog, Hekt, the Egyptian goddess whose head was the frog.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   Nat, the god that they worship.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   Geb, god of dust and the earth.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   Fly, Kepri, the god--it was the head of a beetle.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   Sick cattle, Hathor, is the goddess of fertility.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   The boils, again, the goddess of health, Isis.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   Hail, Nut, the goddess of the sky and the goddess of the air.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   Locust, Neper, Nepri, god and goddess of grain.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   Darkness, the greatest god that they worship.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   Ra, the god of the sun, the most revered.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   Every one of these was a power encounter,
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   not only to show Egypt who it is that's delivering Israel,
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   but these Israelites for 400 years who fell into despair.
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   It's almost like they've kind of accepted the fact that they were slaves,
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   and when Moses tried to--God used him to deliver them,
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   and it didn't happen right away, he said, "It's better for us."
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   Remember, every time it got hard out in the desert, even at the Red Sea,
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   they said, "Oh, if we went back there, I knew we were slaves,
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   but at least over there we had food and we had water and we had safety."
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   For 400 years, they've accepted their identity,
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   and so God was coming in, having a power encounter with them
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   to show them who he is.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   Moses, at some point in this process, began to see and began to believe.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   He lost all faith in himself, and maybe he lost some faith in God during that time,
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   and God was rebuilding him up.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   This man who was afraid, this man who was terrified,
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   timid, becomes this mighty soldier that God uses to deliver.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   You know the Bible talks about how if you have a faith of a muster seed,
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   you can move mountains?
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   That's exactly what happened.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   Moses, this man of tiny faith,
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   literally begging God, "Please don't let me go. Please!"
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   That guy, "They didn't listen to me before.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   Why are they going to listen to me now, even as he is seeing the miracle?"
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   It kind of needed time to build.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   That guy, with that tiny faith, God moved Pharaoh.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   Exactly what he said he was going to do, simply because he saw God.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   Hebrews 12, 20-21, describes Moses seeing God at Mount Sinai this way,
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   "For they could not bear the command, 'If even a beast touches the mountain,
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   it will be stoned.'
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   And so terrible is the sight that Moses said, 'I am full of fear and trembling.'"
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   Fear of God.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   He met God, and he realized who God was,
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   and instead of fearing Pharaoh, instead of fearing the opinions of the Israelites,
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   it said he feared God.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   The great theologian, Kanye West, says,
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   they asked him, those of you guys who know Kanye West,
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   they asked him, "Aren't you afraid of the cancel culture?"
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   You know, things that you say, and the Christian things that you say, and Jesus is Lord.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   And he said, "I don't fear that, because I fear God."
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   He said, "Fear of God overcomes all other fears."
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   Kanye West.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   Out of mouth of babes.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   Proverbs 9, 10 says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding."
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   Beginning of wisdom is when we are emptied of our self-confidence,
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   when we are done with our ingenuity,
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   when we've reached the end of the possibility that we have, our potential,
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   when we've reached the end of all of that,
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   and you have no other hope but to turn to God,
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   and you fear God, he said, "That's the beginning of wisdom."
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   The greatest hindrance to our fruitfulness is not our circumstance.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   It's us.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   Us thinking that us get together, and if we have enough of us,
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   and if we have the right techniques from us,
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   that God's going to magnify us.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   That's what gets in the way.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   And the way that we use that is, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   When it's really meant, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   Our natural tendency is to worship the creation rather than the creator.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   He changed, and his fear was overcome by a greater fear of God,
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   because he saw what was unseen.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   Whenever we do inductive Bible study, we have to ask good questions.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   The question that we ask is verse 28 and 29.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   It says, "By faith he left Egypt, and he was not afraid of Pharaoh,
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   because he saw God."
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   Then there's two particular events that are highlighted.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   We have to ask, "Why are those two things highlighted?
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   How come the other events are not highlighted?"
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   There's ten plagues, not one.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   Many things happen, but why are these two particular events highlighted,
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   saying that this demonstrated the faith of Moses?
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   The first one is pretty obvious, because it says, "By faith he kept the Passover
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he destroyed the firstborn,
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   would not touch them."
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   We know the Passover.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   Every time we have a communion, we celebrate that because Jesus fulfills that.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   You know what's interesting about that is their top god was the god Ra.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   Some of you guys may know from maybe watching National Geography.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   I'm butchering that. I forget what that is.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   National Geography.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   Okay, so you've probably seen pictures, right?
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   That's the one that kind of looks like a dog.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   That was the top god that they worshipped.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   As they worshipped that, it was understood that Ra owned all of the firstborn children
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   of Egypt.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   It was dedicated.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   If you had your firstborn, it was dedicated to Ra for the service of Ra.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   So you can see why God, his final and the most powerful power encounter with Egypt
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   was to challenge Ra, that he was going to come.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   The angel of death was going to come and destroy all the firstborn,
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   but the only ones that would survive are the ones that, by faith,
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   covered their doorposts with the lamb's blood.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   And so that was the power encounter.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   That was the final and the greatest challenge to the nation of Egypt
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   and for Israel to realize that there's only one true God.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   But the second reason is pretty clear because that obviously pointed to the coming of Christ.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   And as soon as that happened, God told the nation of Israel
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   that you do this every single year to celebrate this Passover meal,
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   to remember the way that God delivered you,
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   and it's really pointing to the coming of Christ.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   The blood of the lamb is going to cover our sins,
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   and the angel of death is going to go over us, and we will be saved.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   Those of you who participate in the Passover meal,
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   there's a part of the meal where you take the three pieces of matzah,
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   and you take the middle one, and you hide it away for a while,
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   and at the end of the meal, you bring it back,
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   and you break it and give it to each of the members at the table and your family.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   The Israelites, the Jewish people, to this day practice that,
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   but when you ask them exactly what the meaning behind that, they don't know.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   They lost it.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   That was practiced in the first century when Jesus was practicing it.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   So if you look at the text, when Jesus is practicing the Passover meal,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   he takes the bread, which would have been the second one,
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   that he hid away for a while and brought back, broke it and gave it to them,
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   and Jesus said, "Do this in remembrance of me."
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   I mean, it's pretty clear that that second is Jesus Christ,
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   the second and the third person of the Trinity,
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   that's crucified for three days and buried and come back to life.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   I mean, we see that very clearly, but they practice this every year
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   without knowing the significance.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]   So we know why the Passover is chosen,
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   because it is the clearest picture about his death and his atonement over us.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   But why the deliverance from the Red Sea?
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   In fact, the deliverance of the Red Sea is so dramatic
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   that this event is recorded in Psalm 66, 6, 78, 13, 106, 9, 136, 13,
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   and is repeated over and over again.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   In fact, Moses breaks out into this song in Exodus 15, 1 through 13,
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   "I will sing to the Lord, for he is highly exalted,
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   the horse and the riders he has hurled into the sea.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   The Lord is my strength and song, and he has become my salvation.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   This is my God, and I will praise him, my Father's God, and I will extol him."
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   Why is this event particularly highlighted?
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   You know, as I was wrestling through that question myself,
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   I began to see so many similarities of what God was doing.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   Remember in the book of Hebrews it says the tabernacle
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   is a shadow of the reality to come in Christ.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   But it wasn't just the tabernacle.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   The whole nation of Israel, the Feast of Booth, the Passover,
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   all of the feasts that God gave the nation of Israel
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   pointed to something that was going to be found in Christ.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   So let me ask you, how many years were the Israelites in bondage?
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   400 years.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   How many years gap was there between the Old and the New Testament
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   where there were no prophets, where it says that God was silent during that period?
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   400 years.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   So during those 400 years God wasn't speaking, and Israelites fell into despair
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   because the prophet wasn't coming. God wasn't speaking to them.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   And so they began to kind of fall into different categories.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   Like, "Well, what are we going to do? What are we going to do?"
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   So they broke up into Pharisees, and they broke up into Sadducees, the Essenes,
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   and the Zealots, all trying to, by their own strength and by their own might,
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   some became a little bit more religious, some became more political,
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   some decided to just walk out to the desert,
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   and then some picked up arms and got militant.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   But it was all their effort to fulfill what they wanted.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   Well, 400 years while they were in bondage, the Israelites fell into despair
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   because God didn't deliver.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   Remember, when they walked into Egypt, they came in as Joseph's second man,
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   and they were protected by Pharaoh.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   But at some point the new Pharaoh comes, and they forget,
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   and they turn into slaves, and they've been crying out, and it took too long.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   But right in the middle of their despair, God shows up and delivers them.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   And clearly, the Passover is what God used to deliver both Egypt
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   and the New Covenant people.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   But if you look at the Red Sea, when does the inauguration of the church,
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   the New Covenant people, begin?
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   Acts chapter 2.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   The Holy Spirit comes, and He enters into the people.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   They begin to speak in tongues and in various languages,
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   and that was the inauguration of the New Covenant and new people.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   Well, Israelites, them exiting Egypt and coming into the New Promised Land,
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   on the other side of this Red Sea, they become the people of God.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   They were Israelites by descendants, but the political Israel,
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   the national Israel happens on the other side of Red Sea.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   And at the Pentecost, you see, when the Holy Spirit comes,
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   it says there was a violent wind that came.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   In the Red Sea, it says that the wind began to swirl and started to divide.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   And so they were crossed from one kingdom, kingdom of Egypt,
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   to a new kingdom, the kingdom of God.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   And that's what happens at the Pentecost.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   The people of the Old Covenant, by the Holy Spirit,
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   becomes the people of the New Covenant.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   Now, you can say I'm milking it, but these are things that I see
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   that clearly point to God's people being delivered by the blood of Christ
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   and then inaugurating a new kingdom on the other side.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   Now, why is this significant?
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   Because every part of this points to the sovereignty of God.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   Every part of this is God's plan.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   Every part of it, even the things that we understand,
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   things that we don't understand, God has been orchestrating
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   in details of what was going to happen.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   So God is in complete control.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   Moses was just a weak man that encountered a great God.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   Every time we put a man on a pedestal and our faith depends on that man,
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   when that man fails, we fail along with him
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   because we have a tendency to worship the creation rather than the creator.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   No man is to be in that spot.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   It doesn't mean that we don't honor.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   It doesn't mean we don't respect.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   God says to submit to the elders of the church,
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   but no man stands in the position where only God stands.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   Our faith should not fail because a weak man failed.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   Your faith should not be shaken because a fallen man
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   happens to demonstrate his fallenness.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   Our faith is on solid ground.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   Christ and Christ alone is our foundation.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   So as we study and as we go through the history of Israel,
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   if we look at that and we see, like, wow, Moses was a great man.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   What did he do?
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   He shepherded that we need to hone in our skills.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   David, he became a huge--he became an expert rock thrower,
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   so we need to shine our rocks and make sure that we do this.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   It's like you missed the whole point.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   The whole point of that is why does he choose the lesser over the greater?
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   Why didn't he choose the Sadducees?
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   Why didn't he choose the rich?
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   Why did he get a bunch of fishermen who know nothing about the law?
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   They weren't trained at the temple.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   Why did he get a bunch of people who hated each other, the tax collector,
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   like, and zealots on the same team?
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   Why did he choose the weak to dumbfound the wise?
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   Wouldn't it be easier to get the wiser to dumbfound the wise?
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   If you're going to go over power, wouldn't you get something more powerful?
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   Why does he choose the foolish?
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   Why does he choose the dumb?
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   That's not my language.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   It's the Bible.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   So that you and I would recognize that it's not us.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   It's him.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   It's God.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   It's always God.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   So that our faith would not rest in man, but on God.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   That's why Apostle Paul, with all of his wisdom and knowledge and training,
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   he says, "I resolve to know nothing but Christ crucified."
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   Because the power is not in me, it's not in you, it's not in our system,
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   it's not in our experience, it's not in our age, it's not in our knowledge,
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   it's not in our determination, it's not in our discipline,
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   it's not in our organization.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   It's in Christ and Christ alone.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   So if there's anything that we need to be striving week after week,
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   it's to see God.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   We don't study the Bible so that we can be experts in the Bible.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   We study the Bible so that we can see God.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000]   We don't pray so that we can say we prayed one hour, two hour, three hour.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   We pray so that we can encounter God.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   We don't come to worship because we have greater music.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   We come to worship so that we can encounter God.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   Because the only power to change the world is God.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   To think that somehow, that if I'm articulate enough, if I'm smart enough,
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   if I'm organized enough, if I'm disciplined enough,
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   I can bring somebody who's going to hell to give up their lives and follow Jesus Christ.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   The arrogance of that statement.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   If you can do that by honing your skill, you should be the richest man on earth.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   If you can get somebody to abandon the world and to follow Jesus Christ by your skill,
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:04.000]   by your knowledge, by your will, then you can sell anything.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000]   You should be a multi-billionaire.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   The arrogance of that.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   We are the strongest when?
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   When we are the weakest.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   When we are weak, He is strong.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   So if we learn anything through Israel's history,
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   that we recognize not these men, but the God behind these men,
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   that we may worship Him and build our life upon the rock of Christ.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   Let's pray.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   Let's take a few minutes as our worship team comes up to lead us in prayer
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   to take some time to really ask the Lord and ask yourselves,
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   when was the last time you could say you've genuinely encountered Christ?
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   I'm not asking like, did you check off that I read the Bible, I prayed,
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   I did my homework, I gave and I served.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   But that's not the question I'm asking.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:14.000]   When was the last time you really felt like God was hearing your prayers?
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   That you encountered God and you got courage because of that?
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   That you were willing to forsake whatever you were tempted by
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   because the fear of God, the love for Christ,
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000]   was much bigger than anything else that was tempting you?
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   When was the last time you encountered this God?
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.000]   Maybe the thing that we should be striving for now more than anything else
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   is to come before the Lord and seek Him, ask Him, knock,
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000]   and to honestly pray.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   I believe, help my unbelief.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000]   I don't have the power within myself.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   I need you.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.

[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:39.980]   - Let's pray.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:43.980]   2 Corinthians 4, 17 and 18.
[01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:46.980]   For momentary light affliction is producing for us
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:50.980]   an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison.
[01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:52.980]   While we look not at the things which are seen,
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.980]   but at the things which are not seen.
[01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:57.980]   For the things which are seen are temporal,
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:00.980]   but the things which are not seen are eternal.
[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:03.980]   Lord, help us to number our days,
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:07.980]   to know, Father God, how quickly we come and go,
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:08.980]   that our life isn't missed,
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:11.980]   so that we would not put any confidence in our flesh
[01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:14.980]   or in anything, Lord, that is temporal.
[01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:17.980]   Help us, Lord God, to fix our eyes upon Christ,
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:21.980]   and that when he comes, that we will be glorified in him,
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:24.980]   that we will live for the eternal, not for the temporary.
[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.980]   I pray that you would open our eyes, Lord God,
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:29.980]   that we may have a greater vision of who you are,
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:31.980]   so that the more we see your glory,
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:34.980]   the more courage that we will have to live, Lord God,
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:37.980]   according to the calling that you've given us.
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:39.980]   I pray, Father, wherever you send us,
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:43.980]   that you would give us the strength to reflect who you are,
[01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:47.980]   your mercy, your grace, your love, your holiness,
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:49.980]   that the world may know, Father God,
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:53.980]   that there is hope in the name of Jesus Christ.
[01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:55.980]   So we pray, Father, for guidance,
[01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:59.980]   we pray for power, we pray for humility,
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:02.980]   that we may be used for noble purposes this week.
[01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:04.980]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
