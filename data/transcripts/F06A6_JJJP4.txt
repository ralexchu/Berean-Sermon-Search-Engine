[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.240]   I was an orphan.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.240]   I was an orphan lost at the fall.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.240]   Running away when I heard your call.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:50.240]   Father, you were a joke, man.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.240]   I had no righteousness of my own.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.240]   I had no right to draw near your throne.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:03.240]   Father, you loved me still.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:10.240]   And in love before you made the world's foundation.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:17.240]   You predestined to adopt me as your own.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:24.240]   You have raised me up so high above my station.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:31.240]   I'm a child of God by grace and grace alone.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.240]   You left your home to seek out my loss.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.240]   You knew the great terror of my cause.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:45.240]   Jesus, your face was seen.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.240]   I worked my fingers down to the bone.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.240]   Nothing I did could ever atone.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.240]   Jesus, you paid my debt.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:04.240]   By your blood, by your blood I have redemption and salvation.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:11.240]   Lord, you died that I might be, but you have sung.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:18.240]   And you rose that I might be a new creation.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:26.240]   I am born again by grace and grace alone.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.240]   I was in darkness all of my life.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.240]   I never knew the day from the night.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.240]   Spirit, you made me see.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:43.240]   I swore I knew the way on my own.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.240]   Head full of rocks, heart made of stone.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.240]   Spirit, you moved me.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:59.240]   As your touch my sleeping spirit was awakened.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:06.240]   On my darkened heart a light of Christ has shone.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:13.240]   Called into a kingdom that could not be shaken.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:20.240]   Heaven saved sin by grace and grace alone.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:27.240]   So I'll send to faith by grace and grace alone.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:33.240]   I will run the race by grace and grace alone.
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:40.240]   I will slay my sin by grace and grace alone.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:45.240]   I will reach the end by grace and grace alone.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:17.240]   Oh, great God of highest heaven, occupy my lowly heart.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:22.240]   Own it all and reign supreme.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:27.240]   Conquer every rebel power.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:37.240]   Let no vice or sin remain that resists your holy word.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:42.240]   You have loved and purchased me.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.240]   Make me yours forever.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:55.240]   I was blinded by my sin.
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:19:00.240]   Had no ears to hear your voice.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:05.240]   Did not know your love affair.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:10.240]   Had no taste for heaven's choice.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:16.240]   Then your spirit came alive.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.240]   Open up your words to me.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:28.240]   Through the gospel of your son, lay me in this home.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:54.240]   Call me now to live a life that's dependent on your grace.
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:04.240]   Keep my heart and guard my soul from the evils that I face.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:14.240]   You are worthy to be praised with my every thought and faith.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:23.240]   Oh, great God of highest heaven, glorify your name through me.
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:37.240]   You are worthy to be praised with my every thought and deed.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:49.240]   Oh, great God of highest heaven, glorify your name through me.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.240]   This time our sister Katerina will come give her testimony.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:07.240]   [silence]
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.240]   Good morning, church family and friends.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:16.240]   My name is Katerina, and I have the privilege of sharing my testimony with you all today.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:21.240]   I grew up in a Christian home with parents who taught me about God,
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.240]   brought me to church, and enrolled me in Christian school.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:30.240]   I was often described as a good kid as I followed the rules and I stayed out of trouble.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:34.240]   But good appearances are not enough to save me.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.240]   God is all-knowing, and he saw the depth of my sin.
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:47.240]   God is also holy, and so my sins against him were not just minor indiscretions, but cosmic treason.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:53.240]   I deserve judgment, but God was rich in mercy, and he loved me greatly.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.240]   He sent his only son to be condemned in my place.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:02.240]   Some of you may know that my husband and I are adopting a little boy from Korea.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:09.240]   I can't even begin to fathom the amount of love it must have taken for God to give up his only son.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:18.240]   This profound display of love and gospel truth changed my life at the young age of five.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:24.240]   I still vividly remember finding a small space in our home on our playground
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:31.240]   and praying quietly that the Lord would forgive me of my sin and that he would use my life for his purpose.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:36.240]   In that moment, I was justified, but I'm still being sanctified.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.240]   In particular, I struggled a lot with control.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:46.240]   Those who know me know that I like things very neat and very tidy.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:53.240]   I believe that if I worked hard at something, that it should yield the results that I expected.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:58.240]   This was often manifested in my relationship with other people.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:07.240]   I worked hard for other people's affirmation, but disappointments would often cause me deep despair and anger.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.240]   In hindsight, I see how God withheld certain friendships from me
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:16.240]   because he knew that they would become idols in my heart.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.240]   It is in vain that I struggle to control my life.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:27.240]   My hope cannot be placed on things that change, because otherwise my hope and my joy will also fluctuate.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:31.240]   Rather, the safest thing for me to do is to trust and surrender in the Lord,
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:38.240]   one who is unchanging and in control of all things, because then I can be content in every circumstance.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:45.240]   At the age of 16, I chose to undergo sprinkling as a profession of my faith in Jesus.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.240]   At the church that I grew up in, this was the method of baptism,
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.240]   and I believed at that time that it was sufficient as an act of obedience.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:24:00.240]   This past year, God has led me to meditate on Romans 6, specifically verses 3-5, which states,
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:07.240]   "Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:11.240]   We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death,
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:17.240]   in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:24.240]   For if we have been united with him in death like this, we shall certainly be united with him in resurrection like this."
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:31.240]   Through this passage, God led me to realize that baptism is meant to display his death and resurrection.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:40.240]   Just as he died, was buried, and was raised, my baptism shows how I die to myself and my plans.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.240]   I am buried and then raised to live a new life with him.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:52.240]   My decision to be baptized through immersion is an act of obedience to the convictions that God has placed in my heart through his word.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:59.240]   I am a child of God, and my aim in this life is reflected through the words of Apostle Paul in Galatians 2.20,
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:06.240]   which states, "I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:13.240]   In the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.240]   May he receive all glory and praise. Thank you.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:22.240]   [applause]
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:45.240]   [applause]
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.240]   [applause]
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:55.240]   Baptism is communion with Christ's death by coming out of the water, symbolizing communion with Christ's resurrection.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:02.240]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, in the name of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:07.240]   [applause]
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:11.240]   [applause]
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:34.240]   Okay.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:41.240]   All right, we're grateful again to be able to hear her testimony.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:46.240]   What a fellowship of spirit that is, thinking through how God has led us.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:51.240]   I know perhaps a lot of you guys could sympathize with learning things when you were young,
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.240]   and then following in obedience as you continue to walk with him.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.240]   This morning, I have the privilege of sharing with you, essentially from my devotions,
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.240]   a bird's-eye view of the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.240]   So would you please turn your Bibles there?
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:09.240]   Because I'm going to be giving a bird's-eye view of it, we're going to be hitting a lot of passages.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.240]   And so just as a forewarning, I'm going to ask you to refer to,
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.240]   and kind of jump around just a little bit, between from passage to passage.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.240]   Okay?
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:27.240]   And before we jump in, we will take a moment to ask for the Lord's blessing on our time, so let's pray.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.240]   Father, we want to thank you so much.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:37.240]   We thank you so much for your incredible grace, you showering your mercies and your love upon us.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:40.240]   Thank you so much for Cat and what you have done in her life.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.240]   Thank you, Father God, for the light that you shine through her.
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:48.240]   And we pray that every single one of us would have a fellowship of spirit and unity
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.240]   because of the grace we receive, because of our common relationship with you.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:56.240]   This morning, God, as we open up your word, this morning as we hear your truth,
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.240]   grant to us greater conviction that God, our faith, would be grown and matured.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:05.240]   We thank you in Christ's name. Amen.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:10.240]   Back almost, like, 12 years ago, I used to teach at an academy, an after-school academy,
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.240]   and I used to teach lots of subjects from English,
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:17.240]   but one of the subjects was actually what's called public forum debate.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:22.240]   Now, within the world of debating, there is a really common term that they use,
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   which is the horror of the status quo, okay, the horror of the status quo.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.240]   And what that means is if you're debating and arguing anybody,
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:36.240]   you have to show somebody why they need to hear you, okay?
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.240]   If you're trying to win an argument or you're trying to enact a policy
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:44.240]   or you're trying to convince your wife that you need a new tool in the garage,
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:49.240]   you have to show and convince her or anybody that there is a need for this.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:53.240]   For example, if I did need a new tool, I could show her all day, like,
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:58.240]   "Look how this thing shines. Look how sharp it is. Look how amazing and great it is.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.240]   Look how much on sale it is." But what's she going to say?
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:05.240]   She's like, "I know it looks great, but you don't need it." Right?
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.240]   "You don't need it." So what do I have to do?
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:11.240]   I have to explain to her, like, "Oh, my goodness, you know, I just spent and wasted three hours
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.240]   because I didn't have the right tools. I almost cut my hand.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.240]   You don't want me to hurt myself, do you?" Right?
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.240]   I have to go over to my neighbor, like, Jim's house to borrow this tool,
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.240]   and I know you don't like Jim. You know, like, whatever it may be,
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:28.240]   you just start to enhance the horribleness, how bad it is right now that I don't have this tool.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.240]   Right? It's dangerous. Okay?
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:34.240]   That's what's called the horror of the status quo.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:41.240]   When you look at the Book of Ecclesiastes, you guys know, in general, this book is not like an upbeat book.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:45.240]   This book is trying to summarize for you the horror of the status quo
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:51.240]   when King Solomon looks at the world from a bird's-eye view as king.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:55.240]   As one of the wisest men to walk the earth with discretion, understanding,
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:02.240]   with prose, poetics, and proverbs, he is giving to us a reality, a picture of the world.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:06.240]   And that's the wisdom we're supposed to gain from this book. Okay?
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.240]   Turn your Bibles to chapter 1, verse 1, Ecclesiastes.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.240]   And this is what he says.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:15.240]   The words of the preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem,
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.240]   "Vanity of vanities," says the preacher.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.240]   "Vanity of vanities." All is vanity.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:27.240]   When he is looking at the world, he is trying to convince you and give to you wisdom.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.240]   And he wants you to see it like he sees it.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.240]   Everything is vain.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.240]   There is emptiness.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.240]   There is futility.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.240]   There is meaninglessness.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:45.240]   And my case to you this morning is going to be that, no, King Solomon is not exaggerating.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.240]   He's not just speaking in literary form.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.240]   He's telling you the truth.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.240]   He's giving you godly wisdom.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.240]   I want to begin in King Solomon's argumentation.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:00.240]   He tells you that this world is absolutely pointless. Okay?
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.240]   Absolutely pointless.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:09.240]   What I mean by that is when something is pointless, it means there's no goal here.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:13.240]   What's the point up there? Right?
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.240]   What's the motivation here?
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.240]   What's the meaning?
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.240]   And he says, "There's nothing. It's all vain."
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.240]   To prove this point, he gives us a couple categories.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.240]   And he says, "You know what's pointless? It's all the work you do."
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.240]   Take a look at verse 3.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:35.240]   Chapter 1, verse 3 tells us, "What advantage does a man have in all his work, which he does under the sun?"
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.240]   And then he gives to you in the rest of the book this rationale.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:44.240]   "Well, you know what I've seen? I've seen a guy sweat, toil, labor for days, sacrifice, and everything.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.240]   There's actually no reward.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:53.240]   I've seen a guy work until he's old, and he doesn't even get to enjoy it, and he gets to give it to his son, who squanders it away."
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.240]   What on earth is the point?
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:02.240]   And if you recall, God Himself has told us, "There is a pointlessness built into the current system,
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:09.240]   because man will work by the sweat of his brow, and he will till the ground, but it will bear no fruit."
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.240]   There is a fruitlessness into the pattern of the world.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:20.240]   Speaking of pattern of the world, we realize that King Solomon teaches us there is a pointless pattern to everything he sees.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:25.240]   For those of you guys, again, thinking about maybe work and sometimes how fruitless it is, many people complain,
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:32.240]   "Oh, the drudgery. You punch in, you punch out, and the day just repeats itself, and it's just like a wheel.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:36.240]   You just keep going and going. I don't know how much more I can take this."
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:41.240]   Starting from verse 4, Ecclesiastes chapter 1, verse 4, King Solomon says this,
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:45.240]   "A generation goes, and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:50.240]   Also the sun rises, and the sun sets, and the hastening to its place, it rises there again,
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:55.240]   blowing toward the south, towards the north, the wind continues to swirl."
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:59.240]   What is he saying? He is saying in poetical form,
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:06.240]   there is just this monotonous routine and pattern to the world, and whether you like it or not, it's just going to happen.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.240]   And you have very little control over this.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.240]   And what's going to happen is you're going to work, and then you're going to die,
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.240]   and then the pattern is going to repeat itself, and someone is going to replace you.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.240]   And King Solomon has this angst, like he's a king.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:23.240]   And he asks this question, "I'm a king after another king."
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.240]   And then you remove a guy, and another guy comes in.
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.240]   There is this grievous thing, even if something is horrendous or something is good,
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:34.240]   there is this pattern in life that you cannot escape.
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.240]   And I think people feel that angst.
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.240]   I see sometimes people tell me, "Pastor Mark, I quit."
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:45.240]   "What did you quit?" "No, no, no, it's just my job. I just couldn't take it anymore."
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.240]   "I just didn't see a future. Every day was the same."
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.240]   "I couldn't see advancement. I couldn't see myself learning anything."
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:55.240]   "And so now I just quit." "Do you have anything lined up?" "No, I just couldn't take it."
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.240]   Sometimes people do that.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.240]   And part of it is there is a rhyme and reason behind that.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:05.240]   Do I think it's the wisest thing in the world to quit without something in Don Deck?
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.240]   Not necessarily.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.240]   But there is a rhyme and reason through that, and King Solomon sees it.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.240]   You know what else he says?
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:17.240]   When people start to feel this kind of angst of the patterns and the pointlessness,
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.240]   what they do is they turn to pleasure.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:21.240]   King Solomon has done the same.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:26.240]   Turn your Bibles over to chapter 2, verse 1, and look what King Solomon says.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:30.240]   He says, "I said to myself," he's talking to himself now,
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:33.240]   "Come now, I will test you with pleasure."
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.240]   "So enjoy yourself, and behold!"
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.240]   It too was futility.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:40.240]   "I said to laughter, 'It was madness and of pleasure. What does it accomplish?'"
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:46.240]   "I explored with my mind how to stimulate my body with wine while my mind was guiding me wisely,"
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:50.240]   "how to take hold of folly until I could see what good there is for the sons of men"
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.240]   "to do under heaven for the few years of their lives."
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:56.240]   Basically, he said, "You know what I decided to do?"
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.240]   "I just decided to live it."
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.240]   "I decided to go look for some meaning."
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:05.240]   "I decided to go look for some pleasure, at least in this short time of this whole monotonous routine."
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.240]   "I can enjoy it."
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:13.240]   And then he says, "I enlarged my works, I built a house for myself, I planted vineyards for myself."
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.240]   He basically just says, "You know what? You name it, I had it."
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.240]   "I had houses."
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.240]   Some of you guys are like on Redfin, on whatever websites,
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.240]   you're like, "This might be a good time to buy. The rates are so low."
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:27.240]   And then you think that buying that home is going to be grand.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.240]   You talk to any homeowner, they're going to be like, "Oh my goodness."
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:33.240]   "This is broken, that's broken, there's no end."
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.240]   It's a different perspective.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.240]   But what's more, he says in verse 10,
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.240]   "All that my eyes desired, I did not refuse them."
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:45.240]   "I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure, for my heart was pleased because of all my labor."
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.240]   "And this was my reward for all my labor."
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:52.240]   "Thus I considered all my activities which my hand had done, and the labor that I exerted."
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:57.240]   "Behold, all was vanity."
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.240]   King Solomon is giving you wisdom.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.240]   He's speaking and he's saying, "Those of you who are younger, looking forward to your life, thinking,"
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:09.240]   "You know what? Once I get there to that job, once I have that home, once I have that possession,"
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.240]   "and you think you're going to be satisfied,"
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.240]   "I have gone before you."
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:19.240]   "None of it is satisfying, and none of it seems to have a point."
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:23.240]   And that's why there are individuals who are filthy rich, because King Solomon was filthy rich.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:27.240]   There are individuals who have celebrity status, and they hate it.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:32.240]   Why? Because they realize, "I'm not sure there was a point to all that."
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:36.240]   You know, this sermon is starting to sound like a real downer.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:40.240]   And as I was meditating and preparing for this, you know, I was doing devotions in this,
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.240]   and I was going really slow, and I realized,
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:46.240]   "Wow, King Solomon has such a bleak look on life."
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.240]   But it gets worse.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.240]   The next point is that the entire world is helpless.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:55.240]   When you see that there are these woes, there are these patterns of life,
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.240]   and then the pointlessness of life,
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:00.240]   your temptation is to want to fix it,
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:05.240]   but what King Solomon says is, "It's helpless," meaning it's unfixable.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:09.240]   Take a look back at chapter 1, verse 12.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:13.240]   So I know we're flipping around here and there, but go to chapter 1, verse 12.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:18.240]   And he says, "I, the preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem."
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:22.240]   Wait. He's king. He's got authority. He's got power.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:26.240]   If anybody can see something and be like, "Fix it," that's the king.
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.240]   But you know what he says?
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:32.240]   "I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom concerning all that has been under the heavens,
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   and it is a grievous task which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:40.240]   I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun,
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:44.240]   and behold, all is vanity and striving after wind."
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.240]   Now listen to this.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:53.240]   "What is crooked cannot be straightened, and what is lacking cannot be counted."
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.240]   Do you hear that?
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:57.240]   Number one, whenever you're trying to look for a solution,
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:01.240]   you have to thoroughly understand the problem, but he says, "I tried.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:04.240]   You guys, I tried.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:07.240]   I tried to wrap my head around it, and I couldn't
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:11.240]   because it could not be counted how many things are wrong.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.240]   Just this past weekend when it was 4th of July, I went down to San Diego to visit.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:19.240]   It was wild because what ended up happening was right when we were there,
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:25.240]   just before one of their neighbors, their 3-year-old drowned in the pool,
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.240]   in an induced coma in the hospital.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.240]   And then you look on the news in San Diego,
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:34.240]   there was a man who drove off the cliff with his daughters, young daughters in his car.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:38.240]   If you're the type to like listening to news, you know what he's saying.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.240]   There is so much wrong in the world.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.240]   You get sick of it.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.240]   Yes?
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:53.240]   Even if you were king, could you even count all the vices, all the injustices that happen?
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:58.240]   You keep reading chapter 1, verse 16, and he says, "I said to myself,
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:03.240]   'Behold, I have magnified and increased wisdom more than all who are over Jerusalem before me,
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.240]   and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.'
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.240]   I set my mind to know the wisdom and to know madness and folly.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:18.240]   I realize that this also is striving after wind, because in much wisdom there is much grief."
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:25.240]   Brothers and sisters, when you look at the world, there is sin, there is wretchedness,
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:29.240]   there is wickedness built into the system.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.240]   And for anybody who thought, "We can fix this!"
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:36.240]   For anybody who thought, "If only we had greater know-how and wisdom!"
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.240]   King Solomon had it.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.240]   He was the king who was much wiser than any before him.
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.240]   He was given wisdom to rule his nation.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:54.240]   And he's telling us in wisdom, "I have dedicated myself to learn how to govern this kingdom."
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:59.240]   And let me tell you something, it's been painful.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.240]   That's what it's saying.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:07.240]   Now, when you think about this, he was a bona fide genius!
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:11.240]   He was somebody who actually had the power to tell a subordinate individual,
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:15.240]   "You, stop!" or kick somebody out or do this, and instantaneous.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.240]   He didn't even have to go through a procedure.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:22.240]   He spoke in the kingdom and it was, and yet still, he is convincing us,
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:27.240]   "I tried, but this world is helpless!"
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.240]   Oh my goodness.
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.240]   I've got to be honest, as I was doing my devotions,
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.240]   there's a part of me that's like, "Why so down, King Solomon?
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:39.240]   Why are you so pessimistic?
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:44.240]   You are probably the most bawl-humbug person I've ever read in the Bible."
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:48.240]   I mean, there are many, but my goodness, chapter after chapter of this,
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.240]   you know, for those of you guys who have read through Ecclesiastes,
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.240]   this is the bulk.
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.240]   Everything is futility. Everything is vanity.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:59.240]   Now, I might say to him, "King Solomon, I think you're maybe a little over-exaggerating.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:04.240]   Everything, like everything is hopeless."
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:09.240]   And what King Solomon is going to say to us is, "No, you don't understand.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.240]   I'm not exaggerating here.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.240]   He is trying to show us in wisdom and prove to us
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:19.240]   this world is not as it seems."
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.240]   And so he continues.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.240]   He tries to convince us and say the next point,
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.240]   that this world is hopeless.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.240]   Not only is it pointless, not only is it helpless,
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:33.240]   it is utterly hopeless.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:38.240]   Turn over to Ecclesiastes chapter 3, verse 18.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:42.240]   In Ecclesiastes chapter 3, verse 18, this is what King Solomon says.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.240]   "I said to myself concerning the sons of men,
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:52.240]   'God has surely tested them in order for them to see that they are but beasts.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.240]   For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of the beasts is the same.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.240]   As one dies, so dies the other.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:02.240]   Indeed, they all have the same breath, and there is no advantage for man over beast,
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.240]   for all is vanity.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.240]   All go to the same place.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:09.240]   All came from the dust, and all return to the dust.
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:15.240]   Who knows that the breath of man ascends up,
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.240]   and the breath of the beast ascends down to the earth."
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:22.240]   What he's saying is, why do you assume you're that much better than the beast?
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:26.240]   Why do you assume your future is so much better?
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.240]   Now truth be told, way of wisdom and way of righteousness
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:33.240]   is so much better than folly, but there is this radical truth King Solomon
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:38.240]   bears upon us to convince us, look at the world for what it is.
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:42.240]   Whether you're wise or you're a fool, your destination is the same,
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:46.240]   which is you will die the same horrible death.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:52.240]   This is the horror of the status quo, and his logic is sound.
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:57.240]   Someone might say, "Wait a minute, Pastor Mark, you believe in fate?"
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.240]   King Solomon talks much about fate.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:05.240]   And what you realize is, you know what the dictionary definition of fate is?
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.240]   The dictionary definition of fate is simply a development event
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.240]   that is radically beyond a person's control.
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.240]   Then yes!
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:18.240]   You see, King Solomon is trying to convince you in wisdom.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.240]   You presume way too much about yourself.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:24.240]   You presume way too much about this world,
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:28.240]   because his scenario is not too far off from ours.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:33.240]   To think that because you're wealthy, to think that because you're in power,
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:38.240]   that the world is as it should be is actually false.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:44.240]   You do recognize the kind of time of peace we are in compared to the rest of history.
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:50.240]   To assume that this is the way it ought to be, we are living in a unique time.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:54.240]   What's more, you don't even have to look that far into history.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.240]   Look compared to the rest of the world.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:05.240]   You and I are living in a radical sense of privilege and peace compared to the rest of the world.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:10.240]   But then to assume this is the way it ought to be, King Solomon is saying, "You don't understand.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:16.240]   We are so subject to fate, because you are not in control.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:22.240]   And the humility you need to learn is actually you're just like the beast."
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:27.240]   When you think about this, what he's saying is, "You're hopeless.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:31.240]   What hope do you have? You're going to strive, you're going to toil, you're going to labor,
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:36.240]   but when it comes down to it, you're going to face the same exact consequence
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:41.240]   of our finite human sinful state.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.240]   You're going to die."
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:46.240]   That is an absolute reality. Let me just say something here.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:50.240]   This is, yes, is a sad, sad state of events.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:55.240]   But I am willing to bet a lot of you, I'm willing to bet a majority of you,
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:45:00.240]   you know very well there is nothing guaranteed that you're going to have 70 years of your life.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:06.240]   The vast majority of you probably by the time you hit high school, you already knew somebody who died way too early.
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:12.240]   You probably already know individuals that have, you can say, it was so unfortunate.
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:16.240]   But the fact of the matter is none of us are guaranteed that.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:20.240]   You're going to have a sad state of hopelessness.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:25.240]   Now moving to the second kind of section of the sermon, and transitioning,
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:29.240]   you could take a look at this and just say, "Wow, this is just so sad."
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.240]   But there is a question, what do you do with this knowledge?
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:38.240]   When you see, like King Solomon sees, when you see the pointlessness and the meaninglessness,
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:44.240]   when you see how helpless it is, when you see how hopeless it is, what are you supposed to do?
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:50.240]   Because the scenario is so far above and beyond worse than we think it is.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.240]   There's so many things that are hidden.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:56.240]   Just right now, some of you guys know I'm in school.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:46:02.240]   I have to write a paper on youth suicide and to look up statistics.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:10.240]   The sad state of affairs is in any given day there are over 135 individuals who commit suicide in the U.S.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.240]   And we're thinking, "What?"
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:16.240]   But that's not even counting just simply individuals who have attempted suicide.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:21.240]   The attempt count is above 1.4 million per year.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:27.240]   Okay, King Solomon, my point to you was King Solomon is not exaggerating.
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:37.240]   If you try to sit and count, if one death is grievous, how many more is 50,000?
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:43.240]   How many more individuals were at 1.4 million individuals attempting suicide in America?
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:46.240]   What I'm saying here is, what do you do with that?
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.240]   And King Solomon gets real really fast.
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:56.240]   Turn your scriptures over to chapter 2, verse 17 of Ecclesiastes.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:02.240]   And when you think about this, if we actually believed and saw like King Solomon,
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.240]   that all your feeble attempts to fix stuff didn't work,
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:09.240]   as a matter of fact, maybe some of us desperately looked to other people to help us.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.240]   And we desired other people to come and save us.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:15.240]   And we recognize people themselves are very disappointing,
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.240]   and sometimes when people try to get involved, it just makes matters worse.
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.240]   And you feel this hopelessness.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.240]   There are no other recourses to turn to.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.240]   What ends up happening?
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:31.240]   Well, King Solomon says this, verse 17, chapter 2, "So I hated life,
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:35.240]   for the work which I had done under the sun was grievous to me,
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:38.240]   because everything is futility and striving after wind.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:41.240]   Thus I hated all the fruit of my labor."
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.240]   What is he saying there?
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.240]   He hates life.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:50.240]   Ecclesiastes chapter 4, for the sake of time, just listen to this.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:54.240]   He says, "I look again at the acts of oppression which are done under the sun."
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:56.240]   He looks at injustice.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:00.240]   "And I so behold the tears of the oppressed, that they have no one to comfort them.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:05.240]   And on the side of the oppressors was power, but they had no one to comfort them.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:09.240]   So I congratulated the dead who are already dead, more than the living who are still living.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:14.240]   But better off than both is the one who never existed."
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.240]   Whoa.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:20.240]   We have to take a moment to meditate.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:23.240]   Is King Solomon saying to die is better?
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:25.240]   Is he even advocating?
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.240]   How dare he? Like suicidal thoughts?
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.240]   This is not what you teach children.
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.240]   This is not what you teach the church.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.240]   This is not how you encourage people.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:36.240]   What on earth is he doing?
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.240]   Isn't this bothersome?
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.240]   This is very bothersome.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:45.240]   And I'll tell you what, even in my own heart as I was doing devotions through these passages,
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.240]   and meditating on these truths,
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:50.240]   there was a part of me that was resisting.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:55.240]   There was a part of me that was resisting and saying, "Ah, King Solomon just sounds like a bitter guy."
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.240]   Maybe it was because he had way too much.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.240]   Maybe it was because he was relishing in all these pleasures and it got to his head.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.240]   Maybe that's why.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.240]   No, no.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:12.240]   King Solomon actually begins to show us there was another way for me to behave.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.240]   There was another way for me to react.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:16.240]   You know what that way was?
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:20.240]   It's the way what I like to call, "You just do the best with what you got."
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.240]   Right?
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:26.240]   You essentially kind of deceive yourself and you lie to think you try to make the most of what you have.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:29.240]   And the motto that a lot of parents teach their kids is, "You know what?
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:35.240]   When you get lemons in your life, what you do is you add a dash of sugar and you make lemonade."
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.240]   And we think that's such good advice.
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:44.240]   What's really interesting is to some degree King Solomon gives this kind of advice in almost a sarcastic tone.
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:49.240]   Turn your Bibles over to Ecclesiastes 5, verse 18.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.240]   Ecclesiastes 5, verse 18.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:57.240]   So what I'm saying here is, number one, when you see the hopelessness of the world,
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.240]   you can end up simply hating your life and wishing you never existed.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:04.240]   Or number two, you can do what's called, "You make the most of it."
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.240]   You just live.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:07.240]   And this is what he says.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:14.240]   Verse 18, "Here is what I have seen to be good and fitting, to eat, to drink, enjoy oneself in all one's labor,
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:18.240]   in which he toils under the sun, during the few years of his life which God has given him.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:20.240]   For this is his reward."
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.240]   You know what's kind of funny?
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:26.240]   I read that as though he was actually giving an advice.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:29.240]   I'm going to take a moment to do a little personal confessing here.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:34.240]   There was a part of me as I was looking at the wretchedness of the world through the eyes of King Solomon,
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.240]   I felt resistance.
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:41.240]   And I couldn't necessarily put a finger on it, but I think I want to explain it to you in this way.
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:45.240]   We recognize there's impulses of our hearts.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:50.240]   And there's a part of me that wants to fight back and say, "But are you saying give up on everything?
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:54.240]   Should I teach my own son, like, 'Don't go to school'?
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:58.240]   Should I tell my church people, 'You know what you're doing? It's stupid. Stop.'"
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.240]   No, you're supposed to still work.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.240]   You're supposed to still build a family.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.240]   You're supposed to still live, come to church.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.240]   You're supposed to still grow.
[00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:09.240]   So part of me felt this reactionary thing.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:13.240]   But what's really interesting about this is in another passage, King Solomon tells a young man,
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:16.240]   "You know what, young man? You have a short time to live.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:19.240]   Go pursue your passions. Go fulfill your lusts.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.240]   But just remember, God's going to judge you for all of it."
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:23.240]   What he was doing was being sarcastic.
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:26.240]   This is purely just wisdom of the world.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:30.240]   I'm trying to teach you something better.
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:34.240]   And so now, this is the center and heart of the message.
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:38.240]   I'm trying to show you that King Solomon has words of wisdom for us.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:46.240]   Even if your heart is resisting, first recognize that he is seeing the world appropriately for what it is.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.240]   Right?
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:52.240]   There is, yes, a temptation in our heart to look at King Solomon and say, "No, King Solomon."
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.240]   Again, straight up, I was kind of like, "You know what?
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:58.240]   Maybe King Solomon is doing this kind of like woke culture stuff."
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:02.240]   Where he's like, "You think you have it good. You don't know. This is so bad."
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.240]   You know?
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.240]   Like, is he exaggerating?
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:10.240]   And again, my conviction is, no.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.240]   He is trying to teach us.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:16.240]   Any kind of hope in this world is going to be a tragedy.
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:22.240]   When you think that you're going to wisen up, when you think that you're going to self-improve,
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:28.240]   so that incrementally you can make this life better, it's all monopoly.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:32.240]   I meditated deep and long about this, so jot this down in your notes.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.240]   It's all monopoly.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:42.240]   Let me try to explain why I found this to be both in my heart and yet this to also still be vanity.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:44.240]   Have you guys all played that game Monopoly?
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:45.240]   I'm sure you have.
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:47.240]   It's such a classic.
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:50.240]   That game Monopoly, it's a game that takes a long time to play.
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:56.240]   It's a game where you win property and you get to charge people rent when they land on it.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:01.240]   You know what's really funny is I googled that game and I asked this question of Google.
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:04.240]   When does the game end?
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:07.240]   And what's really funny is there's so many entries.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.240]   There was like blog posts about this and some people responded by saying,
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:13.240]   "You know when Monopoly ends? It's when you cry."
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:15.240]   It always ends in tears.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:17.240]   You know when Monopoly ends?
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.240]   It's when your brother points the finger at you, accuses you of cheating,
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:23.240]   flips the board and all your houses go flying.
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.240]   You know when Monopoly ends?
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.240]   And then somebody wrote, "Never."
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.240]   It never ends.
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:34.240]   And then somebody wrote, "You'd have to be one kind of special jerk to insist that we actually end the game."
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:37.240]   Because you guys know who've actually played this game, how it ends.
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:40.240]   There can be only one.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:43.240]   The game ends when everybody else has to declare bankruptcy
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:47.240]   and you're the only person standing with property.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.240]   That's how the game ends.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:52.240]   I played this with my family recently.
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.240]   It's so sad.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.240]   The little one, he's sitting there.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:58.240]   He's having to pay all this rent and stuff.
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.240]   He's got like $4 in his little hands.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:03.240]   And he stands up to look at the board.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:06.240]   He rolls and you know us as parents, we can count the squares faster.
[00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.240]   So we're like, "Oh no."
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:11.240]   And part of you, you feel sympathy.
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.240]   So what do you do?
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.240]   You almost want to cheat the game for him.
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:16.240]   Just roll again.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.240]   That roll didn't count, right?
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:20.240]   Because you know where he's going to land.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.240]   The party is like, "Oh no, it's okay."
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.240]   You want to loan him some money.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:24.240]   You know what the game rule says?
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:28.240]   You're not allowed to loan people money.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.240]   Part of you wants to almost cheat him.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:33.240]   Like miscount, be like, "Oh no, you land here."
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:36.240]   Or you just desire to keep this game going.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:41.240]   Even though you know there's no chance for him to survive with $4.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:45.240]   This is where I realized my heart was too.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:48.240]   There is this weird defense against King Solomon to say,
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:51.240]   "No, no, no, we can make this work.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:53.240]   Give me a little bit more time.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.240]   Give me a little bit of your knowledge."
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:58.240]   People are doing to King Solomon what people do in our day.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.240]   They hold blog posts and they interview people.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.240]   They have YouTube channels.
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:03.240]   They're like, "Let's interview King Solomon."
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:06.240]   They go over there and they're like, "What did you do here?
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:08.240]   What laws did you enact?
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.240]   How did you get so wealthy?
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.240]   How did you get so wise?"
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:14.240]   And King Solomon is going to turn to them and say,
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:18.240]   "Your pursuit of reproducing this kingdom on earth,
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:21.240]   vanity of vanities.
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:24.240]   All is vanity."
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.240]   You see, what you realize when you're playing that game,
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:31.240]   you're simply delaying the inevitable.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.240]   He's going to be the first person out, but I feel so bad.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.240]   I just want to, like, give him some of my houses
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.240]   and give him some of my money.
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:40.240]   What does that do but build false hope?
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.240]   Monopoly is wicked.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.240]   Okay, that's my point.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.240]   I'm just kidding.
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:45.240]   You can still play.
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:46.240]   We ended up not finishing the game.
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:51.240]   Now, moving on to the spiritual application.
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:54.240]   I am a parent thinking regularly about, "Oh, my goodness.
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:57.240]   What world am I going to bring my kids into?
[00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.240]   What life are they going to have in America now
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:01.240]   that the country is so divided,
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:04.240]   that people are lovers of themselves,
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:06.240]   that there's so much subjectivity
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:09.240]   and nobody even knows right from left?
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:12.240]   But then do I teach them, 'But you, son, you have potential.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.240]   You have value.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.240]   You have worth.
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:16.240]   You can do it.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.240]   Put in your time.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:18.240]   Put in your energy.
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.240]   Sacrifice your friends.
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:21.240]   Sacrifice this and that so that you can succeed.'
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:24.240]   Is that what I'm going to teach them?"
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.240]   Only to have them return to me later and say,
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:30.240]   "But Dad, I thought I was going to be happy
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:34.240]   after having sacrificed all this stuff."
[00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:36.240]   Is that what's going to happen?
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.240]   No, I'm going to teach them the realities
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.240]   that King Solomon is going to teach them.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:43.240]   Sons, hard truth.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.240]   You're entering into a corrupt world
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:48.240]   that already stands condemned.
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:52.240]   You need to look to God.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.240]   You can't look in.
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:55.240]   You can't look out.
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.240]   You need to look to God.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.240]   So I want to take this opportunity
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:03.240]   to introduce you the third way that you can respond
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:06.240]   when you see what King Solomon sees.
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:08.240]   When you see the hopelessness, the helplessness,
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.240]   and the pointlessness,
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.240]   you can just hate life and be like,
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:12.240]   "You know what? I'm out.
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.240]   I don't want to live here anymore."
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:15.240]   You can lie and be like,
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:16.240]   "You know what? Let's make lemonade."
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:19.240]   Or you can look to God
[00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:21.240]   who will tell you like it is.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:24.240]   God has already told you, brothers and sisters,
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.240]   listen to Him.
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:28.240]   As an exhortation to you,
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:30.240]   you need to listen and harken your ears.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:34.240]   You need to call upon the Lord and hear His wisdom.
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:37.240]   God has already told you that this generation
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:38.240]   is wicked and perverse
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:42.240]   and the axe is already there at the base.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:44.240]   This world is ripe for judgment
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.240]   and it's going to get worse.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:50.240]   What's more, our Lord Jesus already said
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:55.240]   that His kingdom is not of this world.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:59.240]   Let's take a moment to thank God. Amen?
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:03.240]   If we believe all that King Solomon believed
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:05.240]   without God in our lives,
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:08.240]   we are only left to our devices.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:11.240]   And you don't need all of King Solomon's wisdom
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:13.240]   to see that
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:15.240]   because already there are case examples
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:18.240]   of people who have been rich, wealthy, famous,
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:22.240]   who hate their lives but it's so unsatisfactory,
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:25.240]   so disappointing.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:28.240]   Hear King Solomon's exhortation to us.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:33.240]   Turn in your Bibles to Ecclesiastes 12:1-7.
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:35.240]   Brothers and sisters, hear it.
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.240]   Hear His wisdom.
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:39.240]   He spent 11 chapters in the book of Ecclesiastes
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:42.240]   showing you that there is no hope in this world
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.240]   including in you.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:48.240]   But He says to you, Ecclesiastes 12:1,
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:50.240]   "Remember your Creator.
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.240]   In the days of your youth,
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:54.240]   before the evil days come
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:55.240]   and the years draw near,
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:57.240]   when you will say, 'I have no delight in them,'
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:59.240]   before the sun and the light
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:01.240]   and the moons of the stars are darkened
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:04.240]   and the clouds return after the rain,
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:06.240]   remember your Maker.
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:08.240]   Consider God.
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:10.240]   Look to Him."
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:13.240]   I can't read that whole section because of time
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:16.240]   but it's so beautiful and poetic
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:18.240]   how He describes to us,
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.240]   "You have but a short life on this earth
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.240]   while you have a moment.
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.240]   Listen to God.
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:26.240]   If anybody's sitting here telling you,
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:28.240]   'No, no, no, you gotta play this game,'
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:31.240]   let them know this is all monopoly.
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:33.240]   King Solomon was on the top of the world.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.240]   He was the king with power, resources,
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:37.240]   and he had all the pleasure in the world
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:38.240]   and he looked up and realized,
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:40.240]   'Oh my goodness, we're just playing a game.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.240]   You're taking turns rolling the dice
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.240]   and by chance we're landing on spaces
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:45.240]   but at the end of the day,
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:47.240]   I gotta turn all this in because all of us,
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:51.240]   we're going back in the box.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:54.240]   We're all going back in the box.'"
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:56.240]   So what does he do?
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.240]   He points up and says,
[00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:00.240]   "You need to listen to God."
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.240]   Thanks be to God.
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.240]   What he says is first and foremost,
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.240]   "Yes, this world is condemned."
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.240]   But secondly he says,
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:10.240]   "I have a better plan for you.
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.240]   You may ask of kings,
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.240]   'What's your plan for our country?'
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.240]   You may ask of politicians,
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.240]   'What's your plan for us?
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.240]   What's your plan for your term?'
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.240]   You may look to family, friends,
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.240]   you may even look to this church asking them,
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:28.240]   'What's your plan to lead me, to guide me?'"
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.240]   Brothers and sisters,
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.240]   we are of those who believe
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:34.240]   our Lord and His kingdom.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.240]   He has a better plan for us.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.240]   Amen?
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:41.240]   Turn your Bibles now over to Hebrews 11.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.240]   As you guys know,
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.240]   chapter 11 is a chapter
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.240]   on the great hall of faith.
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.240]   Faithful men who have walked this world with courage
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:53.240]   made incredible sacrifice that astounds us.
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.240]   But listen to what it says of them.
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.240]   Hebrews 11:39.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:00.240]   Take a moment to get there in your scripture.
[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.240]   And he says,
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.240]   "These, these faithful ones,
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.240]   were all commended for their faith,
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.240]   yet none of them received
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:09.240]   what had been promised since.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.240]   God had planned something better for us,
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.240]   so that you,
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.240]   sorry,
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.240]   that only together with us
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:20.240]   would they be made perfect."
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.240]   Brothers and sisters,
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.240]   let that soak in for a little bit.
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:27.240]   God has something incredibly planned
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.240]   in His kingdom
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:32.240]   that's so much far above and beyond.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.240]   And we could take days to meditate upon
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.240]   how much greater it is
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.240]   for us to have Him as our King,
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.240]   the Righteous One who has perfect justice,
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.240]   perfect knowledge,
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.240]   perfect power
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.240]   to enact for us His justice.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.240]   We could sit here and meditate on this idea
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.240]   that God not only has this desire
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:52.240]   to make for us the better kingdom,
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:56.240]   but He's going to make you perfect.
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.240]   He's not going to just make sure
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:00.240]   that there are laws to guide you.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.240]   He's going to make sure that you're blameless.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.240]   You no longer will have pride.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.240]   You no longer will have greed in here.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.240]   You no longer will have selfishness.
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.240]   This is the kind of kingdom
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:14.240]   to which we are hoping in.
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.240]   This is to us the eternity
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:17.240]   that we're going to have.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.240]   And the challenge for us then
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:22.240]   is to make sure we're thinking on this level.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:25.240]   And so I want to give some final exhortations to you.
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:28.240]   Final exhortation first being
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.240]   that make sure that you're not evaluating this world
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.240]   according to the flesh.
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.240]   Make sure you're not seeing things
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:35.240]   according to this world.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:39.240]   But rather, you're seeing things in the Spirit.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:42.240]   You're seeing things according to the eternal perspective.
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.240]   Through what God has given you
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:46.240]   as the value of eternity in heaven,
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.240]   you are putting in its appropriate place
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:51.240]   everything from your fears to your setbacks
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.240]   and including your successes.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.240]   Imagine with me if this world
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.240]   and this generation right now in this moment,
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:00.240]   this day was different
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:03.240]   and we had so many things going for us.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.240]   There was low crime.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.240]   There was low unemployment.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.240]   You guys were being successful.
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.240]   You were living life
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.240]   with all the accomplishments in your world.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:16.240]   What do you think King Solomon would say to you?
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.240]   Still vanity compared to eternity.
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.240]   Right?
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:24.240]   Still empty compared to what God has in store.
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:27.240]   God has better plan for us.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.240]   And so in our day when we talk,
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.240]   in our day when we speak,
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.240]   because right now there are so many people
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.240]   with so many opinions,
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:38.240]   and I for one are one of those people
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.240]   who's been contributing to that.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.240]   You know online people are typing
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.240]   and people are saying this, that opinion.
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.240]   We have social commentators.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.240]   We have social influencers.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:51.240]   We have political anchors and this and that.
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:52.240]   Journalists.
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:55.240]   Everybody has an opinion.
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.240]   But for us, make sure,
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.240]   let us make sure
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:02.240]   that we are speaking in the wisdom of King Solomon.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.240]   Let us make sure that we're speaking
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.240]   with the eternal perspective.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.240]   If you turn your Bibles,
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.240]   we're already there in Hebrews 11.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:14.240]   Not Ecclesiastes, but Hebrews 11, verse 13.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.240]   Continuing on with the reflection
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:20.240]   about those who've been faithful in the old.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.240]   Of them it says,
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:25.240]   all these people were still living by faith
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.240]   when they died.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.240]   They did not receive the things promised.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:31.240]   They only saw them and welcomed them from a distance,
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.240]   admitting that they were foreigners
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.240]   and strangers on earth.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:38.240]   People who say such things show
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:41.240]   that they are looking for a country of their own.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.240]   If they had been thinking of the country they had left,
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:46.240]   they would have had opportunity to return.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.240]   But instead they were longing for a better country,
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:51.240]   a heavenly one.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:55.240]   Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God,
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:59.240]   for he has prepared a city for them.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:02.240]   Brothers and sisters, as an exhortation to you,
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:05.240]   is it pretty clear you're looking for a better country?
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:07.240]   Is it pretty clear when you're frustrated
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.240]   and you have angst
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.240]   and you're looking at all the woes of the generation
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.240]   and you're counting all the injustices
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.240]   and you're like, "Oh my goodness!"
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.240]   Is it really clear
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:20.240]   that you're not just simply trying to defend your home here,
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:24.240]   but is it evidently clear you're a stranger?
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.240]   And is it evidently clear
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:29.240]   you're looking for God's better plan?
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:32.240]   For to us, our citizenship is in heaven,
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.240]   from which we eagerly await for the Savior,
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.240]   the Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.240]   Amen?
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.240]   Let's take a moment to bow and pray.
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:49.240]   Lord God, we thank you so much.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.240]   Although the sermon had so much to do
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.240]   with how fallen this world is
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:56.240]   and we know you told us, God,
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:59.240]   this whole world and all of creation groans in agony
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:02.240]   until redemption happens.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.240]   But Lord, we thank you
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.240]   that in light of all that,
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:10.240]   we recognize that we have a true, unwavering hope in Christ.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.240]   Thank you, Lord, for securing our future.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:15.240]   Thank you, God, in loving us in such a way
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:17.240]   where we can walk this world with confidence,
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:20.240]   even if all things were to fade and fall away,
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:24.240]   even if all our ambitions and desires are passing.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:27.240]   We thank you, God, that you prepare a way for us.
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:30.240]   And Lord, I pray then that we would live by such faith,
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:33.240]   that, God, we would live by such eternal hope.
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.240]   We thank you, Lord.
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.240]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.240]   Amen.
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:41.240]   Let's all stand for the closing praise.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:07:02.240]   [music]
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.240]   Now, why this fear?
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:09.240]   Now, why this fear and unbelief?
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:14.240]   Has not the Father put to grief
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:21.240]   His spotless Son for us?
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:25.240]   And will the righteous judge of men
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:30.240]   Condemn before that debt of sin?
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:37.240]   Now cancel that the cost.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:52.240]   Jesus, all my trust is in your blood.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:08:10.240]   Jesus, you rescued us through your great love.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.240]   Complete atonement.
[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:18.240]   Complete atonement you have made.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:23.240]   And by your death have fully paid
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:30.240]   The debt your people owe.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:35.240]   Wrath remains for us to face.
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:40.240]   You're sheltered by your saving grace.
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:45.240]   Sprinkle with your grace.
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:47.240]   Sing, Jesus.
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:09:03.240]   Jesus, all my trust is in your blood.
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:18.240]   Jesus, you rescued us through your great love.
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:23.240]   How sweet the sound of saving grace.
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:27.240]   How sweet the sound of saving grace.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:33.240]   Christ died for me.
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:38.240]   How sweet the sound of saving grace.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:42.240]   How sweet the sound of saving grace.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:47.240]   Christ died for me.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:10:05.240]   [instrumental]
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:10.240]   Still my soul and know this peace.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:15.240]   The merits of your great high praise.
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:22.240]   The heart your liberty.
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:27.240]   Hiding on his precious blood.
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:32.240]   I feel banishment from God.
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:36.240]   Since Jesus sets you free.
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:39.240]   Sing, Jesus.
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:54.240]   Jesus, all my trust is in your blood.
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:11:08.240]   Jesus, you rescued us through your great love.
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:13.240]   How sweet the sound of saving grace.
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:18.240]   How sweet the sound of saving grace.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:24.240]   Christ died for me.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:29.240]   How sweet the sound of saving grace.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:34.240]   How sweet the sound of saving grace.
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:40.240]   Christ died for me.
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:45.240]   How sweet the sound of saving grace.
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:49.240]   How sweet the sound of saving grace.
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:12:01.240]   Christ died for me.
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:05.240]   Amen. Let's bow in a word of prayer as we end our service.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:10.240]   Lord God, we again want to say, Lord, that we place our trust in you.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:13.240]   Lord, we trust you with all of our lives.
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:18.240]   Anything from the past, Lord, that seems to us too big of a burden.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:22.240]   All guilt and shame, God, you have dealt with in Christ.
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:27.240]   But we also know, Lord, our entire future, our entire well-being,
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.240]   everything that we are and that we long for.
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:34.240]   That too, Father God, fully taken care of in Christ.
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:38.240]   And so, Father Lord, we say to you that we trust you with all of our hearts
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:42.240]   and we dare not place confidence in this world.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.240]   Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:49.240]   and to make you stand in the presence of his glory, blameless with great joy,
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.240]   for the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ, our Lord,
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:55.240]   be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:58.240]   before all time and now and forever. Amen.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.240]   [Music]
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:08.240]   God sent his Son
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:14.240]   They called him Jesus
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:20.240]   He came to love
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:27.240]   Heal and forgive
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:33.240]   He lived and died
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:39.240]   To buy my pardon
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:46.240]   An empty cravings there to fill
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:52.240]   My sacred land
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:58.240]   Because he lives
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:04.240]   I can face tomorrow
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:09.240]   Because he lives
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:15.240]   All fear is gone
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:21.240]   Because I know
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:27.240]   He holds a future
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:32.240]   And life is worth the living
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:39.240]   Just because he lives
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:43.240]   Amen. You may take a seat.
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:46.240]   We pray that you have a blessed week.
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:49.240]   I'm just going to dismiss you now and just as before,
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:52.240]   please go ahead and use either side of the church building.
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:55.240]   We're just going to work from the front and just make a nice exit through the building,
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:58.240]   trying to keep your physical distance as well.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.240]   Thank you so much. You're dismissed.
