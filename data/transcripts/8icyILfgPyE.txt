[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.600]   - All right, good evening, church family,
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.600]   and welcome to our Good Friday service.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.600]   I hope that most of you were able
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.600]   to follow along this week just
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.600]   and reflect on the events of Passion Week
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.600]   leading up to our Lord and Savior's crucifixion.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.600]   And if there's one thing that I was reminded of this week,
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.600]   it is truly just how unworthy I am of Christ
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.600]   and His sacrifice on that cross.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.600]   The Son of God who is worthy would die for me,
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.600]   the unworthy, that I may live.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.600]   And so what a great mystery that is
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.600]   that His amazing grace would come to me.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.600]   So tonight as we gather to worship
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.600]   and to receive His word,
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.600]   to partake in communion together,
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.600]   may we look to Christ, may we look to the cross,
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.600]   the ultimate display of God's love for us,
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.600]   that we may respond with much gratitude
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.600]   and affection toward Him.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.600]   So let's worship together.

[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.520]   Berean Community Church,
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.520]   and especially for those of you
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.520]   who are visiting us
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.520]   for the first time,
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.520]   we want to warmly welcome you
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.520]   to our church.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.520]   We are celebrating
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.520]   Good Friday tonight,
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.520]   and it is what we --
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.520]   I would like to say
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.520]   it's kind of separate
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.520]   from how we celebrate
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.520]   on Easter or Resurrection Sunday.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.520]   It is a very significant time,
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.520]   and every day of this Passion Week,
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.520]   as we've been meeting together,
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.520]   to think about the steps
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.520]   that Christ took to the cross
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.520]   and to his resurrection,
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.520]   every single day
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.520]   is as important as the last.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.520]   And Good Friday, some might ask,
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.520]   why is it that
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:31.520]   for a resurrected Christ
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.520]   that we would spend year after year
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.520]   thinking about his death
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.520]   and the horrendous picture
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.520]   that we just kind of replay
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.520]   over and over again
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.520]   year after year?
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.520]   It's incredibly important
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.520]   for us to remember
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.520]   the happening of Good Friday,
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.520]   that before we can just
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.520]   kind of run to the next part,
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.520]   before we can run
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.520]   to the love and grace
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.520]   and compassion
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.520]   that we so love
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.520]   to just think about
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.520]   and be grateful for,
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.520]   that we have to see
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.520]   what sin cost,
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.520]   and we have to see what sin is
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.520]   that would cause us
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.520]   to worship rightly.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.520]   And so, especially
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.520]   for the visitors,
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.520]   but for all of us
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.520]   who are celebrating
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.520]   the death of Christ,
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.520]   which is a very strange thing
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.520]   to celebrate,
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.520]   when we sing these songs
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.520]   that are coming up here,
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.520]   they're going to be teaching
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.520]   and speaking
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.520]   of this gospel message
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.520]   of Christ, the cross,
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.520]   and what he accomplished for us.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.520]   So, I would really invite us all
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.520]   to bring our hearts together
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.520]   to worship him,
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.520]   to contemplate,
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.520]   to think, and to meditate.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.520]   And so, I'll open us up
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.520]   in prayer here.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.520]   Heavenly Father, I pray,
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.520]   God, that your gospel
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.520]   would sink deep into us.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.520]   Father, please help us.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.520]   God, break through our stubbornness,
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.520]   our blindness.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.520]   God, to see appropriately
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.520]   what you have accomplished,
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.520]   that on this night,
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.520]   as we think about Good Friday,
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.520]   a Friday that does not seem
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.520]   in any way good,
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.520]   Lord, that it would be
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.520]   the greatest news for us
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:05.520]   because our Christ died
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.520]   for our sins.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.520]   And so, Father,
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.520]   I pray for genuine worship
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.520]   to come.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.520]   I pray, Father,
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.520]   for all eyes to look upon you,
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.520]   that we would be grateful
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.520]   and that we would crown you
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.520]   our God, our King, our Lord,
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.520]   our everything.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.520]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.520]   Amen.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.520]   Would you stand together?

[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.360]   welcome to our Good Friday service.
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.360]   Let me go ahead and open us up in prayer.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:39.360]   If you'll bow your heads with me.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:44.360]   Oh, Father, God, that song is so powerful,
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:50.360]   not because of any other reason than the message it says.
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.360]   God, you were slain for us.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:56.360]   Jesus, thank you for taking our punishment.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:00.360]   Father, thank you so much for sending your Son.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:05.360]   Thank you, God, that as a result of this Gospel,
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.360]   that many of us who have been saved
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.360]   can raise our voices together in unity
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.360]   and proclaim the praises of our King,
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.360]   of what he did.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:20.360]   Lord, help us to take a good, long look again
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.360]   at the glories of Calvary,
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.360]   at what was accomplished,
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.360]   that we could not do and only he could.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.360]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:36.360]   Well, for a brief rundown of these events
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:39.360]   that we've been going through in Passion Week,
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.360]   on the next slide here, on Sunday,
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.360]   we went through Palm Sunday.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.360]   I know that's very small.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.360]   I'm sorry about that.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.360]   But on Sunday, it was a triumphal entry.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.360]   That's what was preached this past Sunday,
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:52.360]   the message as people were singing "Hosanna, Hosanna,"
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.360]   and Jesus simply wept.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.360]   Because though the myriads of people
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.360]   were worshiping God,
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.360]   that Jesus knew,
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:03.360]   and Jesus understood what was going on in their hearts,
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.360]   that these very same people
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:07.360]   would be the ones jeering at him very soon.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:08.360]   The second day on Monday,
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.360]   Jesus curses the fig tree,
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.360]   and then he just simply leaves it,
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.360]   and the disciples wonder what happened there,
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.360]   and then he begins to cleanse the temple.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.360]   He goes to the place of worship,
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.360]   the greatest place of worship,
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.360]   especially during this Passover season,
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.360]   and he goes,
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.360]   and when the most people are gathered in the year,
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.360]   he begins to flip over these tables
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.360]   and saying that he does not receive this.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:34.360]   You have turned this temple into a den of robbers.
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.360]   On the third day,
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.360]   Jesus pronounces judgment and parables
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.360]   and woes upon the religious leaders of Israel,
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:45.360]   the very people who would be teachers of the law
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.360]   and who would be the keepers of the temple,
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.360]   the ones who are the most religious,
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.360]   the ones who fasted the most,
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.360]   who studied and memorized the scriptures,
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.360]   who are the ones to be looked up to,
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.360]   the ones you would call rabbi,
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.360]   and all of those things
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.360]   that come along with this religion,
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:05.360]   that them he would give the greatest woes.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.360]   Two days ago,
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.360]   we looked at Judas betraying Jesus
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.360]   into the hands of these religious leaders,
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.360]   that the religious leaders of Israel
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:17.360]   held hands with one of Jesus' closest friends,
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:21.360]   and together they conspired to kill Christ.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:25.360]   And yesterday, Jesus leads the Last Supper.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.360]   It's his farewell discourse
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.360]   as he begins to tell of the fact
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.360]   that he will be leaving
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:32.360]   and that the Holy Spirit will be coming.
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.360]   He washes the feet of his disciples
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.360]   and then they make their way to Gethsemane.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.360]   And at Gethsemane,
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.360]   he goes through such agonizing prayer
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.360]   asking God to take away this cup,
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.360]   the very cup that we're going to be looking at today,
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.360]   the cup of wrath,
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.360]   that's not found physically on a cross,
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.360]   but as the wrath of God is being poured out,
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.360]   as he was looking down the barrel
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:57.360]   of eternal wrath from his Father,
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.360]   that he prays in that garden
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.360]   asking if there's any way for it to be different.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.360]   But he asks that God's will would be done
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.360]   and not his.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.360]   He is resolute.
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.360]   His face does not move away
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.360]   from what he is here to do,
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.360]   to die for the very people who want him killed.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.360]   And so this is Passion Week.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.360]   It's the week that answers
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.360]   humanity's greatest problem.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.360]   The Passion Week is so important for us.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.360]   Pastor Peter Chung,
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.360]   when he came up on Monday,
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.360]   said this is, in fact,
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.360]   the most important week
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.360]   in all of history,
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.360]   and I agree.
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.360]   When we look around this world,
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.360]   there are so many problems.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.360]   Many of us are experiencing
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.360]   those very problems today.
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:47.360]   There's great brokenness in our lives.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:50.360]   You know somebody who's dying.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.360]   You know somebody who's sick.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:55.360]   You yourself might be in that condition.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.360]   If you were to just turn around
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.360]   and take a look at what's going on
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.360]   in your family,
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.360]   there are many of us
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.360]   who have broken families,
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.360]   people you have not seen
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.360]   or talked to in years,
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.360]   divorces, adultery,
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.360]   children who don't have parents.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.360]   When we look around
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.360]   at the wars that are going on,
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.360]   we look around
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:17.360]   what's happening in our offices,
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.360]   the gossip, the slander,
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:21.360]   the backstabbing.
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.360]   In our groups of friends,
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.360]   in all of what's going on around us,
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.360]   there is brokenness.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.360]   There is depression.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.360]   There's violence.
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.360]   There's anger.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:37.360]   There's hatred and theft.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.360]   People are taking advantage of people.
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.360]   There are disasters
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.360]   and tragedies and diseases.
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.360]   There are those who are going hungry.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.360]   But again, Passion Week
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.360]   is not here to address all of those.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.360]   Passion Week is here
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.360]   to address humanity's greatest problem.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.360]   All of what I just mentioned
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:02.360]   are symptoms of this greatest problem.
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:04.360]   And that is the impending reality
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.360]   of eternal death.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.360]   And that's what we're going
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.360]   to be talking about today.
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.360]   When Jesus came into the world,
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.360]   that's what He came to address.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:14.360]   We think of Him as a good teacher
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:15.360]   and He was going around
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.360]   helping people
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.360]   and healing people.
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.360]   But He never once said
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:23.360]   that that's what He came to do.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.360]   He always used those
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.360]   as opportunities
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.360]   to point to a greater reality
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:30.360]   of what He actually came to do.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.360]   Yes, He healed people.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.360]   He cast out demons.
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.360]   He multiplied bread
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.360]   to feed the hungry.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:37.360]   He stopped storms
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.360]   and He temporarily
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.360]   brought people back to life.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.360]   He was always pointing to the fact
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.360]   that these were temporary miracles
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.360]   staving off what's coming
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.360]   in this impending death
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:51.360]   that is for everyone.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.360]   The fatal end
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.360]   of every human being
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:56.360]   that He was ultimately
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.360]   trying to point to.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.360]   So we want to ask some questions today.
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.360]   And the first is this.
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.360]   Why is there death
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.360]   in the world today?
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.360]   That's our first question.
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.360]   Why is there death
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.360]   in the world today?
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.360]   Many of us have just
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:14.360]   accepted it
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.360]   as a fact of life.
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.360]   That is actually,
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.360]   it's just what are we going to do?
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.360]   That's what happens.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.360]   It's inevitable.
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.360]   You asking why
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.360]   or knowing why it happens
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.360]   isn't going to change
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:26.360]   the fact that it will come.
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.360]   But if we're to stop
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:28.360]   and ask the question
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:32.360]   why is there death?
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.360]   The Bible answers it.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.360]   What we do know
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.360]   is that death is real.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:40.360]   And I have some slides for us here.
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.360]   We find cemeteries
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:44.360]   and in these cemeteries
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.360]   we know that it's filled
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:46.360]   with people who used to live
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.360]   just like you and me.
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.360]   If there were enough
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.360]   of these tombstones
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.360]   that could number
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:53.360]   the amount of people
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:54.360]   who are here
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:58.360]   that they used to be us.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.360]   That all of us
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:03.360]   will one day be them.
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.360]   I know it's a depressing thought
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:06.360]   but it's Good Friday
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:09.360]   we're talking about death.
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.360]   This is death.
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:14.360]   It's waiting for each of us.
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:15.360]   There is not one of us
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.360]   who can't,
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.360]   it doesn't matter
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.360]   what we believe.
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.360]   It doesn't matter
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:20.360]   what we do.
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:21.360]   This is going to come.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:22.360]   I just googled it.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.360]   I just googled
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.360]   cemeteries of famous people
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.360]   and these are the first
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.360]   three that popped up.
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.360]   Here's the first one.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.360]   John Wayne.
[00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.360]   I wasn't around
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.360]   during his lifetime
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:31.360]   I think.
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:32.360]   I think it was 1970 something.
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.360]   I was born after that
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:34.360]   so I never saw him.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.360]   I never knew him.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:36.360]   All I know
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:37.360]   is that he's a famous man.
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.360]   He accomplished a lot.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.360]   He was an actor I believe
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.360]   and so you look at it
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.360]   and for all that he accomplishes
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.360]   at the end
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.360]   he ends up in one
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:45.360]   of the tombstones.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:46.360]   The next guy that popped up
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:49.360]   was Charles Chaplin.
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.360]   I thought he was
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:51.360]   a lot older than that
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.360]   but he passed away in 1977
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.360]   and a more recent one
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.360]   was Queen Elizabeth.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.360]   These were people
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.360]   who accomplished many things
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:00.360]   and I was just curious
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.360]   to see what would pop up
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:03.360]   and these were the first
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.360]   three that popped up.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:08.360]   It doesn't matter, right?
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:09.360]   At the end
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.360]   we can have romantic notions
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.360]   of what they've accomplished
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.360]   and what they've done
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.360]   but this inevitable end
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.360]   can't be lost on us.
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.360]   That they could have
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.360]   left behind
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:22.360]   even some form of legacy
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.360]   that most of us
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.360]   will not ever be able
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:26.360]   to even dream
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.360]   of becoming like that
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:33.360]   but what of them now?
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:36.360]   For them, not for us.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.360]   What are they thinking now?
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:39.360]   What are they feeling now?
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.360]   What do they want now?
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.360]   Did anything they did
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:47.360]   actually matter for their now?
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.360]   These cemeteries
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.360]   then show that at the end
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.360]   next slide
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.360]   it brings us to the same place.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.360]   Here's a 90 year
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.360]   human life in months.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.360]   If you are a college student
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.360]   and you've been with me
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.360]   in Searchlight
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.360]   I would have showed you
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.360]   this slide before
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.360]   in particular.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.360]   This is a 90 year
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.360]   human life in months.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:04.360]   You would be lucky
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:06.360]   to live 90 years.
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.360]   Look how sobering that is.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.360]   Each of those circles
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:09.360]   is a month.
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.360]   One line is three years
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.360]   and so we can actually do this.
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.360]   If I were to print this out
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:16.360]   for each of us
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:17.360]   we can all fill out
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.360]   how many months
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:19.360]   in our lives
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.360]   have already passed by.
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.360]   I know it's a very depressing
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.360]   exercise to do this.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:25.360]   You can do that
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.360]   in your mind right now.
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.360]   How many lines
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.360]   have you filled out?
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.360]   And how many are left?
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.360]   Now this is small.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.360]   Let's get a little bit smaller.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.360]   That's how many days
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.360]   we have.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.360]   Can't even see it.
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:37.360]   That's how many days we have.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.360]   So we check these off
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:41.360]   day by day by day.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:45.360]   It doesn't matter.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.360]   No matter who we are
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.360]   no matter what
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:48.360]   we've accomplished
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:49.360]   we're checking these things off.
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:50.360]   We could be the most
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:51.360]   intelligent person
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.360]   in the world.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:53.360]   We could be the strongest
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:54.360]   in the world.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.360]   We could be the fastest person.
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:57.360]   We could have multiple
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.360]   Olympic gold medals
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.360]   under our name.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.360]   We could have cured diseases
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:02.360]   that save millions of people.
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.360]   We could have created
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:05.360]   the greatest of inventions
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.360]   and it does not matter
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.360]   because at the end
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.360]   we end up in the same place.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.360]   You could have healed someone
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.360]   and say like wow
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.360]   what a great man
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:14.360]   that his accomplishments
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.360]   would heal these many people
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.360]   only to have them
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:21.360]   also follow you to death.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:26.360]   That's depressing.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.360]   No one knows why we die
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:30.360]   only that we do.
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.360]   Something happens
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.360]   to the cells.
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:34.360]   They degenerate.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.360]   They mutate towards death.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:40.360]   No one knows why.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:42.360]   It's inevitable.
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:45.360]   It's a reality.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.360]   If you were to imagine
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:47.360]   an hourglass
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:49.360]   every single one of us
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:50.360]   has a certain number
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:51.360]   of sands.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:52.360]   Grains of these sands
[00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.360]   that are preordained for us
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.360]   and every moment
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:56.360]   I am taking away
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:59.360]   your precious life right now.
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.360]   The sand of your life
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:04.360]   is currently falling.
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:06.360]   You cannot get that back.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.360]   You cannot stop it.
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.360]   You cannot freeze it.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:13.360]   You cannot add more.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.360]   Ninety years.
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.360]   If we go to the next slide
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:17.360]   here's another exercise.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.360]   These are Super Bowls.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.360]   For those of us
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:22.360]   it's hard to understand
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:24.360]   and comprehend.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:25.360]   There's a Super Bowl
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.360]   every year.
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.360]   Some of us really
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:28.360]   look forward to it
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.360]   at least for the show
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.360]   or the chips.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:32.360]   Every year that goes by
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.360]   I am 37 years old.
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:35.360]   If we go to the next slide
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.360]   that's how many Super Bowls
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:37.360]   have already passed from me.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.360]   That's how many Super Bowls
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.360]   that I have left.
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.360]   That's how many more.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:43.360]   There's nothing to stop this.
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:44.360]   If we go to the next slide
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.360]   if you don't like Super Bowl
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:47.360]   how many times do you see snow?
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.360]   Most people see it
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.360]   every year if you're
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.360]   in Southern California
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:52.360]   because you feel like
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.360]   it's your duty to go
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.360]   and see snow once a year
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:55.360]   or you go to the ocean
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:56.360]   once a year
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.360]   because we probably should.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.360]   Again, 37 years old
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.360]   that's how many times
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:03.360]   I'm going to see the snow.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:06.360]   That's if I live 90 years.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.360]   Can we go all the way?
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.360]   Okay.
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.360]   Whoa.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.360]   You just took away my life
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.360]   very quickly.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.360]   All right.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.360]   If we go to the next slide here
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:19.280]   this is the actual
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.280]   average lifespan of the human
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.280]   in America.
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.280]   This is America.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:27.280]   This would be a little bit
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:28.280]   of a closer bet
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:30.280]   and if you guys are older than me
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:33.280]   then you have more X's on this
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.280]   but we don't even know
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:35.280]   if we have 75 years.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:36.280]   There's a possibility
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:37.280]   if we go to the next slide
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:38.280]   we have 60 years
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:41.280]   or we might have 40 years.
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.280]   I'm 37.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:45.280]   I might live only to 38 years old
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.280]   and quite honestly
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:49.280]   I might just die tomorrow
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.280]   and I would have already
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:52.280]   seen my last day.
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:57.280]   No more snow for me.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:58.280]   In Psalm chapter 90
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.280]   verse 9 through 12
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:00.280]   it says,
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:01.280]   "For all our days
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.280]   have declined in your fury.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.280]   We have finished
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.280]   our years like a sigh.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:07.280]   As for the days of our life
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.280]   they contain 70 years
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.280]   or if due to strength
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:11.280]   80 years
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:12.280]   yet their pride
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.280]   is but labor and sorrow
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.280]   for soon it is gone
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:15.280]   and we fly away.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.280]   Who understands the power
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.280]   of your anger
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.280]   and your fury
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:19.280]   according to the fear
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.280]   that is due you?"
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:21.280]   So listen to this.
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:22.280]   It says,
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:23.280]   "So teach us
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.280]   to number our days
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.280]   that we may present
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.280]   to you a heart of wisdom
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.280]   that numbering our days
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.280]   that doing this exercise tonight
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:30.280]   I feel no remorse
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:32.280]   or apology towards you
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:33.280]   for taking away
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:34.280]   the sands of that
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.280]   because at the end
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.280]   he says
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:37.280]   that numbering your days
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:40.280]   brings you wisdom.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:43.280]   It sobers you up
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.280]   to understand
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.280]   and recognize
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.280]   the brevity of life
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.280]   that death is pending
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:51.280]   and that it is coming
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.280]   and that it is sure
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.280]   and the world
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.280]   tries to cope with this.
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.280]   You and I
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.280]   have tried to cope with this.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.280]   We've tried to figure out ways
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:00.280]   to deal with it
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.280]   to get away
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.280]   from thinking about it.
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:03.280]   Some of us straight up
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:04.280]   we will deny it
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:05.280]   that we will pretend
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.280]   that it's not going to happen
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.280]   that our children
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.280]   will never die
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.280]   that our parents
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.280]   perhaps will be okay
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.280]   but it is coming
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:13.280]   and every time
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:14.280]   the reality hits
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:15.280]   closer
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.280]   and closer
[00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:19.280]   and closer to home
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.280]   it brings us
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.280]   to greater
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:26.280]   and greater states of wisdom.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:27.280]   There are many of us
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:29.280]   who are staving it off
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.280]   that perhaps
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.280]   we know it's coming
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.280]   and so then we will exercise
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:36.280]   we will take multivitamins
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:37.280]   we will go to the doctor
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:39.280]   and get our checkups
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.280]   that we will do
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:44.280]   what we were told to do.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.280]   There are many of us
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:47.280]   who are not thinking about it
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.280]   that we're covering over it
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:50.280]   with entertainment
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:51.280]   with hobbies
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.280]   with our careers
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:58.280]   with advancement
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:00.280]   but it's there
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:02.280]   death coming for us all.
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.280]   It's not a fear tactic
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:07.280]   I'm employing tonight.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:10.280]   This is a simple reality.
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:11.200]   The Bible says
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.200]   that there is going to be
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.200]   something that comes
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.200]   at the end
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:18.200]   of that last thing.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.200]   So it's our question
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.200]   why is there death
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:23.200]   in the world today?
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:26.200]   Why?
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:29.200]   I did nothing to answer it.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:31.200]   I just put in more why
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.200]   I mean that it is there
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.200]   that it's going to happen
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:38.200]   that it's sure.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:39.200]   Well that Psalm 90
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:40.200]   that we looked at
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:41.200]   actually answers it
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.200]   right before.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.200]   This is what it said before
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.200]   but look at the verses
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.200]   right before there.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:46.200]   It says
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.200]   for we have been consumed
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.200]   by your anger
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.200]   and by your wrath.
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.200]   We have been dismayed.
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.200]   You have placed
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.200]   our iniquities before you
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:55.200]   our secret sins
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:57.200]   in the light of your presence
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.200]   and then that's why
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.200]   for all our days
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:00.200]   have declined
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.200]   in your fury.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.200]   The Bible actually answers
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:04.200]   the question
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.200]   as to why we die.
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.200]   We all know we do
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.200]   it doesn't matter
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:08.200]   what you believe
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.200]   or what religion
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.200]   you come back from
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.200]   we all know we die.
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.200]   The Bible tells us
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:14.200]   why it happens.
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:18.200]   It's because of our sin.
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.200]   It is his wrath
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.200]   upon sinners.
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.200]   That's what death is.
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:27.200]   It's not just
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:28.200]   an inevitable reality
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.200]   of life.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:31.200]   It is the consequence
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.200]   of our state.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.200]   It is the consequence
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.200]   of our behavior
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.200]   our words
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:36.200]   our thoughts
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:37.200]   our deeds
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:42.200]   our thoughts.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:43.200]   Romans 6.23 says
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:44.200]   for the wages
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:45.200]   of sin
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:50.200]   is death.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.200]   This brokenness
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.200]   inside of us all
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.200]   this sin inside
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.200]   of us all
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.200]   no person needs
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.200]   to be taught
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.200]   how to sin.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.200]   We are born into sin.
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:56:59.200]   We are born
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.200]   into rebellion.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.200]   We don't need
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.200]   to be taught
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:03.200]   how to be selfish.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:04.200]   Yes there is
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.200]   a moral compass
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.200]   instilled into us all
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.120]   but we were made
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:11.120]   into the image of God
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:12.120]   and yet we are born
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:13.120]   wretched and depraved
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:16.120]   from the very beginning.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:17.120]   Listen to what
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:18.120]   J.C. Ryle says.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:19.120]   He says alas
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.120]   alas it lies smiling
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:21.120]   and crowing in its cradle.
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:22.120]   You know what that is?
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:23.120]   That's a baby.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:26.120]   That's a cute baby.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:27.120]   That little creature
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:28.120]   carries in it
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.120]   in its heart
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.120]   the seeds of every
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:34.120]   kind of wickedness.
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:35.120]   Only watch it carefully
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.120]   as it grows
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:37.120]   and its mind develops
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.120]   and you will soon
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:39.120]   detect in it
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:41.120]   an incessant tendency
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:42.120]   to that which is bad
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:43.120]   and a backwardness
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:44.120]   to that which is good.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:45.120]   You will see in it
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.120]   the buds and germs
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.120]   of deceit
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:48.120]   evil temper
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:49.120]   selfishness
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:50.120]   self-will
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:51.120]   obstinacy
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:52.120]   greediness
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.120]   envy
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:54.120]   jealousy
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:55.120]   passion
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:56.120]   which if indulged
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:57.120]   and let alone
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:58.120]   will shoot up
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:59.120]   with painful rapidity.
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.120]   Who taught the child
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.120]   these things?
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:03.120]   Where did he learn them?
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.120]   The Bible alone
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.120]   can answer these questions
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.120]   and all the foolish things
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.120]   that parents say
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:08.120]   about their children.
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:09.120]   There is none worse
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:10.120]   than the common saying
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:11.120]   my son has a good heart
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:13.120]   at the bottom.
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:14.120]   He is not what he ought to be
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.120]   but he has fallen
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:16.120]   into bad hands.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.120]   Public schools are bad places.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:19.120]   The tutors neglect the boys.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.120]   Yet he has a good heart
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:21.120]   at the bottom.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.120]   The truth unhappily
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.120]   is diametrically
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:24.120]   the other way.
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.120]   The first cause
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:26.120]   of all sin
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:27.120]   lies in the natural corruption
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:30.120]   of the boy's own heart
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:33.120]   and not in the school.
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:34.120]   Romans 3.23 says
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.120]   for all have sinned
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:36.120]   and fall short
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:37.120]   of the glory of God
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.120]   for every single one
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:39.120]   of us have fallen
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:40.120]   into this kind
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:44.120]   of depraved living.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.120]   Earlier on
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.120]   in the text
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.120]   it said
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:48.120]   that there is none righteous
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.120]   not even one
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.120]   and what we pursue
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:51.120]   are more
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:52.120]   and more
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:53.120]   and more
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:57.120]   of the same.
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:58.120]   So our second question
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:58:59.120]   is why is sin
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:00.120]   so egregious
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:04.120]   that it would require death?
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.040]   That is the reason.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.040]   Why is there death?
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:07.040]   Because of sin.
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.040]   What about sin
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:13.040]   would require my death?
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.040]   If somebody killed
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.040]   just serially murdered
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:18.040]   7,000 people
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:19.040]   and we say maybe him
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:20.040]   but what about somebody
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:21.040]   who killed no one
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:23.040]   and just lied?
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:26.040]   What is it about sin?
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:27.040]   Well the scriptures
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:28.040]   teach us
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:29.040]   because it's not simply
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.040]   about the offense
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:36.040]   of whom you offend.
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:37.040]   You know what's interesting
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.040]   is that when we are
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.040]   in a certain state
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.040]   it is hard to see
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:44.040]   outside of that state.
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:45.040]   If you were to live
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.040]   in a community
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:49.040]   where everything
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:52.040]   is just terribly difficult
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:54.040]   that people are stealing
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:55.040]   and hurting each other
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.040]   and stomping
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:57.040]   on each other
[00:59:57.040 --> 00:59:58.040]   to get ahead in life
[00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:59.040]   and you just grow up
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.040]   and that's not a thing.
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.040]   It would be a strange thing
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.040]   for you to just
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.040]   come to a place
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:07.040]   like Irvine
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.040]   where there's so much order
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:13.040]   and everything is so manicured
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.040]   and so when you get plucked
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.040]   out of a certain state
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.040]   you can see it
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.040]   but when you're in it
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:23.040]   it's impossible to see.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.040]   We begin to say
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.040]   this is just how things are.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.040]   So if you're in a place
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.040]   where there is rampant crime
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.040]   then people are just
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.040]   going to grow up saying
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:34.040]   this is how things are.
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.040]   I'm not saying
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.040]   we're okay with it
[01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:41.040]   it's just this is how it is
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.040]   and we're surrounded by this
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.040]   and what happens
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.040]   in our state
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.040]   the reason why
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.040]   we have such a kicking back
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.040]   a rebellious attitude
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.040]   against this fact
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.040]   that sin would actually
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.040]   require my death
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.040]   is because we are
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.040]   currently in a world
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.040]   where we cannot see
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:02.040]   outside of that
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.040]   and so then we begin
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.040]   to create standards
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.040]   in accordance to what we see
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.040]   and in accordance
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.040]   to the world order
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.040]   that we live in
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.040]   that I am better
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.040]   than that person
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.040]   and so therefore
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.040]   there's a standard
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.040]   that I can draw
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.040]   and we all start to do that
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.040]   and we do that here
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.040]   and we look at
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.040]   like criminals out there
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.040]   and we say
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.040]   well they are worse
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.040]   so I get sin
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.040]   death for them
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.040]   but for me sin going to death
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.040]   makes no sense
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.040]   and we create these standards
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.040]   that make no sense
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.040]   because there is nothing
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:38.040]   to tether itself to
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.040]   that's why Ryle
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:41.040]   he says I do not think
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.040]   in the nature of things
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.040]   that mortal man
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.040]   can at all realize
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.040]   the exceeding sinfulness
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.040]   of sin
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.040]   in the sight of that
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.040]   holy and perfect one
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.040]   with whom we have to do
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.040]   he is the one
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.040]   who reads thoughts
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.040]   and motivates us
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.040]   as well as actions
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.040]   and requires truth
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.040]   in the inward parts
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.040]   we on the other hand
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.040]   poor blind creatures
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.040]   here today
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.040]   and gone tomorrow
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.040]   born in sin
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.040]   surrounded by sinners
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.040]   living in a constant
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.040]   atmosphere of weakness
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.040]   infirmity
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.040]   and imperfection
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.040]   can form none
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.040]   but the most
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.040]   inadequate conceptions
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.040]   of the hideousness
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.040]   of evil
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.040]   we have no line
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.040]   to fathom it
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.040]   and no measure
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:16.040]   by which to gauge it
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.040]   this sin
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.040]   in the sight
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.040]   of the one we offend
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.040]   we have broken
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.040]   his laws
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.040]   there is a reason
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.040]   why there is morality
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.040]   inside of us
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.040]   there is a reason
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.040]   why we are able
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.040]   to say that
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.040]   there is good
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:30.040]   and there is bad
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.040]   you can say all you want
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.040]   that this was developed
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.040]   over time in history
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.040]   no there is something
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.040]   inside of us
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.040]   when we see somebody
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:37.040]   smashing in
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.040]   the head of a baby
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.040]   that all of us
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.040]   would react
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.040]   and say that
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.040]   that is evil
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.040]   because there is something
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.040]   inside of us
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.040]   that understands that
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.040]   now where we draw the line
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.040]   we all do
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.040]   what is right
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.040]   in our own eyes
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.040]   we get to create
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:53.040]   the standards of that
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.040]   whether by culture
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.040]   or by society
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.040]   or by governmental
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.040]   laws that are created
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.040]   whether it is
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.040]   by familial structure
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.040]   or the culture
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.040]   that has been developed
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.040]   by our church
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.040]   but these sins
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.040]   are severe
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.040]   before God
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.040]   enough for him
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.040]   to say
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.040]   that the wages
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.040]   of sin is death
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:13.040]   sin is corruption
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.040]   and there is reason
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.040]   why Jesus comes
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.040]   and he links
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.040]   something like lust
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.040]   which is in us all
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.040]   to adultery
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.040]   and we say
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.040]   I get it
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.040]   those people committed
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.040]   adultery
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.040]   I know I know
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.040]   lust is not good
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.040]   I will try my best
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.040]   but those people
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.040]   committed adultery
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:35.040]   will create a standard
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.040]   and a line
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.040]   that divides me
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.040]   from them
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.040]   he links murder
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.040]   with anger
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.040]   there is anger
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.040]   in us all
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.040]   bitterness
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.040]   and resentment
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.040]   and he says
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.040]   it is anger
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:51.040]   anger is murder
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:53.040]   and it is liable
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:54.040]   to the hell fire
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:57.040]   it shows
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.040]   the problem
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.040]   of our sin
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:01.040]   see we get caught
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.040]   up in thinking
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.040]   sin are the sinful
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.040]   things that we do
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.040]   it is not
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.040]   sin comes
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.040]   from the sinner
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:08.040]   it is talking
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.040]   about a state
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.040]   of an individual
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:14.040]   you don't say
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.040]   about the person
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.040]   with cancer
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.040]   oh they have
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.040]   cancerous cells
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.040]   you would say
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.040]   only that they have
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.040]   sin
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.040]   so then
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.040]   to the one
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.040]   who has
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:25.040]   done bad things
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.040]   we would not just say
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:27.040]   that they have
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.040]   done bad things
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:29.040]   they only did
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.040]   these few bad things
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.040]   you would say
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.040]   that they are
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.040]   a bad person
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.040]   I know that is
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:35.040]   hard right
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.040]   but we all have
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.040]   lines for that
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.040]   at a certain point
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.040]   if somebody has
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:40.040]   killed many people
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.040]   and says to you
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:42.040]   but I just killed
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.040]   a few people
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.040]   but for real though
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.040]   I am a father
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.040]   and you should see
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.040]   how much I love
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.040]   my child
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.040]   you say no no
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:51.040]   we understand that
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:56.040]   we as a society
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.040]   are so good
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.040]   at trivializing
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:59.040]   our sin
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:00.040]   we use our own
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:01.040]   standards and rubrics
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.040]   to form the acceptability
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.040]   of our actions
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.040]   but they are all
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.040]   over the map
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.040]   we say some things
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:07.040]   like are okay
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.040]   and we would say
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.040]   that other things
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.040]   are not okay
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:13.040]   and once we set
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:14.040]   them we yell
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.040]   at each other
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.040]   we grow what
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.040]   we think to be
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.040]   righteous anger
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:19.040]   we become judges
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.040]   when we are the ones
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.040]   who are on trial
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.040]   to be judged
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.040]   there is a deep
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:24.040]   corruption in all
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.040]   of us
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.040]   we are liars
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.040]   we are thieves
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.040]   we are adulterers
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.040]   we are murderers
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.040]   we might say
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.040]   that's not me
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.040]   that's not my
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:33.040]   reality
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.040]   but this is
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:35.040]   the reality
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.040]   there are criminals
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.040]   who say that
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.040]   we are not bad people
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.040]   we will say
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.040]   that we are
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.040]   not bad people
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:42.960]   we think that
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:43.960]   we can draw
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:44.960]   the same claim
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:45.960]   before God
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:46.960]   come to him
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.960]   and say
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:48.960]   I'm not so bad
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:49.960]   I'm mostly good
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:50.960]   and we might
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.960]   think it's not
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:52.960]   that big of a deal
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:53.960]   but it's only
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:54.960]   shrouded
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.960]   we might be
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.960]   polite
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:57.960]   we might have
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.960]   grown in courtesy
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:05:59.960]   and thoughtfulness
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:00.960]   but it goes down
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.960]   deep into our hearts
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.960]   we look a certain
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:03.960]   way
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:04.960]   but our hearts
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:05.960]   are wicked
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.960]   and corrupt
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:08.880]   the words
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:09.880]   that pop out
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:10.880]   the thoughts
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:11.880]   that come
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:12.880]   to our minds
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.880]   are symptoms
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.880]   of the deeper
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:15.880]   reality
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:16.880]   that we are
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:17.880]   sinners
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:18.880]   we like
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:19.880]   to put aside
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:20.880]   sin
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:21.880]   and call it
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.880]   a disease
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:23.880]   we blame it
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.880]   on the culture
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:25.880]   we hold
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:26.880]   others culpable
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:27.880]   for what has
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:28.880]   happened
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:29.880]   to me
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:30.880]   Ryle
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:31.880]   also says
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:32.880]   that sin
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.880]   is the universal
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.880]   disease
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:35.880]   of all mankind
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:36.880]   it's this idea
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:37.880]   no matter
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:38.880]   the fact
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:39.880]   that you have not
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:40.880]   you could come
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:41.880]   from an isolated
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:42.880]   island that has
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:43.880]   never touched
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:44.880]   any form of
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:45.880]   civilization
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:46.880]   and sin
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.880]   would still be
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:48.880]   found there
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:49.880]   as sin
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:50.880]   is everywhere
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:51.880]   and so this
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:52.880]   is what the Bible
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:53.880]   says
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:54.880]   this is the
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.880]   reason why
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:56.880]   the reality
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:57.880]   of death
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.880]   that is universal
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.880]   to all mankind
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:00.880]   is upon us
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:01.880]   because sin
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:02.880]   is universal
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:03.880]   that's why
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:04.880]   we die
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:05.880]   and we live
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:06.880]   our lives
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:07.880]   with the hourglass
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:08.880]   day by day
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:09.880]   dropping in sand
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:10.880]   thinking that this
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:11.880]   is important
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:12.880]   or that is important
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:13.880]   and I have to do this
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:14.880]   and I have to accomplish this
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:15.880]   and I'll try to be
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:16.880]   like this
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:17.880]   only for every day
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:18.880]   to pass by
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:19.880]   closer and closer
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:20.880]   only this one
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:21.880]   singular problem
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:22.880]   matters there
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:23.880]   at the end
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:24.880]   this problem
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:25.880]   of death
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:26.880]   and the God
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:27.880]   who stands
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:28.880]   looming over us
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:29.880]   there will always
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.880]   be death
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:31.880]   because there will
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:32.880]   always be sin
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:33.880]   and you cannot
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:34.880]   justify
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:35.880]   you cannot cure this
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:36.880]   there is no outrunning sin
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:37.880]   there is no hiding from sin
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:38.880]   you cannot
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.880]   justify your way
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:40.880]   out of it
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:41.880]   and no excuse
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:42.880]   will be enough
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.880]   your morality
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:44.880]   is not enough
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:45.880]   your skills
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:46.880]   are not enough
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:47.880]   your personality
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:48.880]   is not going to be enough
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:49.880]   your services
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:50.880]   your works
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.880]   your intellect
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:52.880]   your legacy
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:53.880]   that you leave behind
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:54.880]   your attempts
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:55.880]   at compromising
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:56.880]   and pleading
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:57.880]   and negotiating
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:58.880]   and smooth talking
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:07:59.880]   before God
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:00.880]   is not going to be enough
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:01.880]   there will be death
[01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:02.880]   waiting
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:03.880]   and so third point
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:04.880]   what is death?
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.880]   death is not just
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:06.880]   the end of existence
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:07.880]   we think that's
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:08.880]   what death is
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:09.880]   that's what we see
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:10.880]   it's just a grave
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:11.880]   it's a cemetery
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:12.880]   that that's the end
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.880]   but that
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:14.880]   this is only
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:15.880]   a picture
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:16.880]   this is only
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:17.880]   a symbol
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:18.880]   this is only
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.880]   a foreshadow
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:20.880]   of what's
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:21.880]   actually happening
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:22.880]   death
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:23.880]   is eternal
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:24.880]   it is eternal death
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:25.880]   it's perpetual
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:26.880]   death
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:27.880]   it's perpetual
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:28.880]   death
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:29.880]   it's perpetual
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:30.880]   death
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.880]   it's eternal death
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:32.880]   it's perpetual
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.880]   it is continuous
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:34.880]   it will know no end
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.880]   death is seen
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:36.880]   only in part
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:37.880]   here in this world
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.880]   death is only manifested
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.880]   in temporary things here
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:40.880]   in the current
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:41.880]   passing things
[01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:42.880]   that we see
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:43.880]   we will see
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:44.880]   glimpses of death
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.880]   in our lives
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:46.880]   with broken cars
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:47.880]   broken dreams
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:48.880]   end of seasons
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:49.880]   we'll see
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:50.880]   end of a relationship
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:51.880]   we'll see
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:52.880]   sickness take hold
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:53.880]   only glimpses of it
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:54.880]   all this to say
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:55.880]   that inevitably
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:56.880]   will go away
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:57.880]   death
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:58.880]   is only
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:08:59.880]   a picture
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:00.880]   inevitably
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:01.880]   will go to the end
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:02.880]   of life
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.880]   and it's death
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:04.880]   and that's why
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:05.880]   it unsettles us
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:06.880]   because there are
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.880]   stamps of this
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.880]   pending reality
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.880]   of eternal death
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:10.880]   and eventually
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:11.880]   we all end up there
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:12.880]   inevitably
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.880]   in the ground
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.880]   but so much more
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:15.880]   death
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:16.880]   is utter
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.880]   and complete
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.880]   eternal destruction
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:19.880]   death
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:20.880]   is not
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:21.880]   just a state
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:22.880]   of non-existence
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:23.880]   death
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:24.880]   is not
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:25.880]   a state
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:26.880]   of non-existence
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:28.880]   death is not
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:29.880]   just a state
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:30.880]   of non-existence
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:31.880]   we will not just
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:32.880]   turn into dirt
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:36.880]   the bible says
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:37.880]   that death
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:38.880]   is eternal in consequence
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:39.880]   because of who
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:40.880]   God is
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.880]   the bible says
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:44.880]   that God is of pure eyes
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:45.880]   he cannot behold sin
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:46.880]   he cannot look upon evil
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.880]   the bible says
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:48.880]   that God is so pure
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:49.880]   that the smallest of sins
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.880]   cannot be overlooked
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:51.880]   he is the perfect judge
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:52.880]   the bible says
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:53.880]   that God is so pure a judge
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:54.880]   that he
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:55.880]   doesn't just look
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:56.880]   at the outer actions
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:57.880]   but the inner state
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:58.880]   secret sins
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:09:59.880]   inside of us
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:00.880]   will not be left
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:01.880]   unaccounted for
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:02.880]   the bible says
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:03.880]   that God is a judge
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:04.880]   he is so pure
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:06.880]   that there is everlasting punishment
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:07.880]   that there is a
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.880]   what the bible says
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.880]   would be a worm
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.880]   that does not die
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.880]   and a fire
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:12.880]   that is never quenched
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:13.880]   God is so pure
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:14.880]   that no sinful person
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:15.880]   has any hope
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:16.880]   of entering heaven
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:17.880]   and eternal life
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.880]   and so
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:21.880]   it leaves us
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:23.880]   to bring us into
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:25.880]   the passion account
[01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:28.880]   because the point is
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.880]   that we're in big trouble
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.880]   we're in huge trouble
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:36.880]   I don't know if at any point
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:37.880]   we've turned off
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:40.880]   but we are not guaranteed
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:41.880]   the ability to walk out
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:42.880]   those doors tonight
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:45.880]   not a single one of us
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:46.880]   is guaranteed
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.880]   our very next breath
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:49.880]   we are in huge
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:50.880]   trouble
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:51.880]   if we die
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:52.880]   in the state of sin
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:53.880]   right now
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:54.880]   is a time of grace
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.880]   where God is giving us
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:56.880]   opportunity
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:59.880]   but that brings us
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:00.880]   to our fourth point
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.880]   is before that comes
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:03.880]   tonight
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:04.880]   the answer for sin and death
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:05.880]   is Christ on the cross
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:10.880]   sin is dealt with
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.880]   in Jesus Christ
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:17.880]   why does the Passion Week
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:18.880]   matter
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:20.880]   because it tells us
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.880]   about sin
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.880]   and it tells us
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:23.880]   about the solution
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:24.880]   to our greatest problem
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.880]   that God is full of justice
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:28.880]   and wrath
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:29.880]   not in any way
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:30.880]   compromising his goodness
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:31.880]   but God is loving
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:32.880]   and compassionate
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.880]   and kind
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:34.880]   and merciful
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:38.880]   see sin is not just
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.880]   a disease
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:40.880]   it's not just a passive
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:41.880]   reality
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:42.880]   that slowly kills us
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:43.880]   sin is active
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:44.880]   what we see
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:45.880]   as we just
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:46.880]   conclude
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:47.880]   in a passage
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:48.880]   like this
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:51.880]   is that sin is active
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:53.880]   sin is what we've been
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:54.880]   seeing all week long
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:55.880]   it is intentional
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:56.880]   it is purposed
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:57.880]   and it is desiring
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.880]   to do away
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:11:59.880]   with God
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.880]   to kill
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:01.880]   the creator of life
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:03.880]   death is because
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:04.880]   of sin
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:05.880]   death is because of this
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:06.880]   judgment for our sinfulness
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.880]   and so that is what
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.880]   is coming out
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:10.880]   to us
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:11.880]   Matthew chapter 26
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:12.880]   verse 47 through 50
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:16.880]   and this is
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:17.880]   sin
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:18.880]   made alive
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:20.880]   not just the people
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:21.880]   that we read about
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:22.880]   but our sin
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:23.880]   can be seen
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:24.880]   in this text
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.880]   verse 47
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:27.880]   while he was still speaking
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.880]   behold Judas
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:30.880]   one of the twelve
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:31.880]   came up
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.880]   unaccompanied
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:33.880]   by a large crowd
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:34.880]   with swords and clubs
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:35.880]   who came from
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:36.880]   the chief priests
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:37.880]   and elders of the people
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:38.880]   now he who was betraying him
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:39.880]   gave them a sign
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:40.880]   saying
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:41.880]   whomever I kiss
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:42.880]   he is the one
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:43.880]   seize him
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:45.880]   immediately Judas
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:46.880]   went to Jesus
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:47.880]   and said
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:48.880]   Rabbi
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.880]   and kissed him
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:51.880]   and Jesus said to him
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:52.880]   friend
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:53.880]   do what you have
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:54.880]   come for
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:55.880]   then they came
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:56.880]   and laid hands on Jesus
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:57.880]   and seized him
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:58.880]   verse 56
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:12:59.880]   but this
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:00.880]   all this has taken place
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.880]   to fulfill the scriptures
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:02.880]   of the prophets
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:03.880]   then all the disciples
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:04.880]   left
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.880]   and fled
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:08.880]   I hope that
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:09.880]   every juncture
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:10.880]   of this week
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:11.880]   showed you
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:13.880]   that every party
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:14.880]   that was involved
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.880]   that was me
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.880]   that that was us
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.880]   that there is some rebuke
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:23.880]   in our lives
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:24.880]   because of this
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:25.880]   that what we see here
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:26.880]   in Judas
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:27.880]   is not a story
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:28.880]   two thousand years ago
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:29.880]   so far off
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.880]   this is sin personified
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:33.880]   this is what our sin is
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.880]   this is how ugly it looks
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.880]   that that Jesus
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:38.880]   he followed
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:39.880]   that Jesus he pursued
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:40.880]   the Jesus who loved him
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.880]   the Jesus
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:43.880]   who would do so much
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:44.880]   for him
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:46.880]   that he would turn
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:47.880]   and give him over
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:48.880]   like this
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:51.880]   continuing in verse 59
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.880]   look at the continuing nature
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:55.880]   of our sin personified
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:56.880]   now the chief priest
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:57.880]   and the whole council
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:58.880]   kept trying to obtain
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:13:59.880]   false testimony
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:00.880]   against Jesus
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:01.880]   so that they might
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:02.880]   put him to death
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:03.880]   look at how active they are
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:04.880]   they keep trying
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:05.880]   over and over
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:06.880]   somebody that we can
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:07.880]   put to death
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:08.880]   this Christ
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.880]   verse 65
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:11.880]   then the high priest
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:12.880]   tore his robes and said
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:14.880]   he has blasphemed
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:15.880]   what further need
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:17.880]   do we have of witnesses
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:18.880]   behold you have now
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:19.880]   heard the blasphemy
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:20.880]   what do we
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:21.880]   what do you think
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:22.880]   and they answered
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:23.880]   he deserves death
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:27.880]   then they spat in his face
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.880]   and beat him
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:30.880]   with their fists
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:31.880]   and others slapped him
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:32.880]   and said prophesy to us
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:33.880]   you Christ
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:34.880]   who is the one
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:35.880]   who hit you
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:39.880]   this is our sin
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:42.880]   we think our sin
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:43.880]   is not such a big deal
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:44.880]   it is us
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:45.880]   it is me
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:46.880]   who slapped
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:47.880]   the author of life
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:48.880]   it is me
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:49.880]   who mocks him
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:50.880]   who spits upon him
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:56.880]   Matthew 27
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:57.880]   22-26
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:58.880]   Pilate said to them
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:14:59.880]   then what shall I do
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:00.880]   with Jesus
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:01.880]   who is called Christ
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:02.880]   they all said
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:03.880]   crucify him
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:05.880]   and he said why
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:06.880]   what evil has he done
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.880]   but they kept shouting
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:09.880]   all the more
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:10.880]   saying crucify him
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:12.880]   when Pilate saw
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:13.880]   that he was accomplishing
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:14.880]   nothing
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:15.880]   but rather that a riot
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:16.880]   was starting
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:17.880]   he took water
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:18.880]   washed his blood
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:19.880]   washed his hands
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:20.880]   in front of the crowd
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:21.880]   saying I am innocent
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:22.880]   of this man's blood
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.880]   see to that yourselves
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:25.880]   and all the people said
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:26.880]   his blood shall be on us
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.880]   and on our children
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.880]   oh my goodness
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:31.880]   look at that
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:33.880]   then he released
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:34.880]   Barabbas
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:35.880]   for them
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:36.880]   but after having Jesus
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:37.880]   scourged
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:38.880]   he handed him over
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:39.880]   to be crucified
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:42.880]   this is us
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:45.880]   this is our sin personified
[01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:46.880]   this is why
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:47.880]   sin
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:48.880]   deserves
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:49.880]   what it deserves
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:50.880]   this is the prime example
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.880]   this is sin exemplified
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:53.880]   calling
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:54.880]   for the death of the God
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:55.880]   who gave himself
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:56.880]   to save us
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:58.880]   a God who desires it
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:15:59.880]   to such a great degree
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:00.880]   that he would come down
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:01.880]   from heavens heights
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:07.880]   it's so clearly seen here
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:08.880]   in this crucifixion
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:09.880]   that we
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:10.880]   are participants
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:11.880]   participants
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:16.880]   Christ was not just killed
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:17.880]   he was not just
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:18.880]   put to death
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:19.880]   he was murdered
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:20.880]   by a seething people
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:23.880]   it was not just a call
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:24.880]   to kill Jesus
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:25.880]   but to scorn
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:26.880]   and mock him
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:27.880]   to inflict punishment
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:28.880]   upon him
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.880]   we who are
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:30.880]   at the mercy
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:31.880]   of his judgment
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.880]   would put Jesus Christ
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:34.880]   on trial and judge him
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:35.880]   we the guilty
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:36.880]   would judge
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:37.880]   the innocent
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:38.880]   and we would say
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:39.880]   I've done no wrong
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:40.880]   you have done wrong
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.880]   we would look upon evil
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:43.880]   and call it good
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:44.880]   and look upon good
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.880]   and call it evil
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:46.880]   this is the sin
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:47.880]   inside of us
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:48.880]   this very day
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.880]   it manifests
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:51.880]   in different ways
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:53.880]   but in every single
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:54.880]   one of us
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:55.880]   this is what resides
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:58.880]   John Stott says
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.880]   were you there
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:01.880]   when they crucified
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:02.880]   my Lord
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.880]   and we must answer
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:05.880]   yes we were there
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.880]   not as spectators only
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:08.880]   but as participants
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:09.880]   guilty participants
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:10.880]   plotting
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:11.880]   scheming
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:12.880]   betraying
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:13.880]   bargaining
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:14.880]   and handing him over
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:15.880]   to be crucified
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:16.880]   we may try to wash
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:17.880]   our hands of responsibility
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:18.880]   like Pilate
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:19.880]   but our attempt
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:20.880]   will be as futile as his
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:21.880]   for there is blood
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:22.880]   on our hands
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:23.880]   before we can begin
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:24.880]   to see the cross
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:25.880]   as something done for us
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:26.880]   leading us to faith
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:27.880]   and worship
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:28.880]   we have to see it
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:29.880]   as something done by us
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:30.880]   leading us to repentance
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.880]   indeed only the man
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:34.880]   who is prepared
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:35.880]   to own his share
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:36.880]   in the guilt of the cross
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:37.880]   wrote Ken and Peter Green
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:38.880]   the same his share
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:39.880]   in its grace
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:43.880]   participants
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.880]   every Good Friday
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:48.880]   we ought to remember
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:50.880]   that we are not reading
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:51.880]   a story of other people
[01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:52.880]   that did something
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:53.880]   to this God man
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:56.880]   we are staring
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:57.880]   at a story
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:58.880]   that reflects
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:17:59.880]   as a mirror
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:00.880]   into my very own heart
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:03.880]   that my lying
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:04.880]   my lusting
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:05.880]   my selfishness
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:06.880]   my anger
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:07.880]   is seen
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.880]   Matthew 27
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:11.880]   27
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:12.880]   then the soldiers
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:13.880]   of the governor
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:14.880]   took Jesus into praetorium
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:15.880]   and gathered the whole
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:16.880]   Roman cohort around him
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:17.880]   they stripped him
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.880]   and put a scarlet robe
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:20.880]   on him
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:21.880]   and after twisting together
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:22.880]   a crown of thorns
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:23.880]   they put it on his head
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.880]   and a reed in his right hand
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:26.880]   and they knelt down
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:27.880]   before him
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:28.880]   and mocked him
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:29.880]   saying hail
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:30.880]   king of the Jews
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:31.880]   they spat on him
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:32.880]   and took the reed
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:33.880]   and began to beat him
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:34.880]   on the head
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:35.880]   after they had mocked him
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:36.880]   they took the scarlet robe
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:37.880]   off him
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:38.880]   and put his own garments
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:39.880]   back on him
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:40.880]   and led him away
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:41.880]   to crucify him
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.880]   they took the responsibility
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:45.880]   of his blood
[01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:47.880]   and now this is the continuing
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.880]   condition of humanity
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:51.880]   on God
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:55.880]   this is sin
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:58.880]   continuing in verse 45
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:18:59.880]   now from the sixth hour
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.880]   darkness fell upon all the land
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:03.880]   until the ninth hour
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:05.880]   about the ninth hour
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:06.880]   Jesus cried out
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:07.880]   with a loud voice saying
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:10.880]   that is my God
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:11.880]   my God
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:12.880]   why have you forsaken me
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:13.880]   and some of those
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:14.880]   who are standing there
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:15.880]   when they heard it
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:16.880]   began saying
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:17.880]   this man is calling for Elijah
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:18.880]   immediately one of them
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:19.880]   ran and taking a sponge
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:20.880]   he filled it with sour wine
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:21.880]   and put it on a reed
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:22.880]   and gave him a drink
[01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:23.880]   but the rest of them said
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:24.880]   let us see
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:25.880]   whether Elijah will come
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:26.880]   to save him
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:27.880]   what a comical sight
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:28.880]   what is happening here
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:30.880]   and then in verse 50
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.880]   perhaps one of the most shocking
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:33.880]   shocking
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:36.880]   lines in all of scripture
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:37.880]   and Jesus cried out again
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:38.880]   with a loud voice
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:41.880]   and yielded up his spirit
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:46.880]   human sin
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:47.880]   will not stop
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:49.880]   until Christ is crucified
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.880]   dead
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:52.880]   done away with
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.880]   we cannot exist
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.880]   co-exist with a God
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.880]   who is dead
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:00.880]   co-exist with a God
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.880]   like this
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:06.880]   because sin
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:08.880]   is bloodthirsty
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.880]   it's spewing
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.880]   it's angry
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:13.880]   it cries for death of God
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:15.880]   human sin is vicious
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:16.880]   against God
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:17.880]   and rebellious
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:18.880]   human sin can't tolerate
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:19.880]   the existence of God
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:20.880]   who threatens
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:21.880]   our sovereignty
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:22.880]   our desires
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:23.880]   our pleasures
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:25.880]   we need him out of the picture
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:26.880]   we need him gone
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:27.880]   and we hate him for it
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:29.880]   we hate that
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:30.880]   he demands these things
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.880]   and so what we see here
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:34.880]   is the impossible
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.880]   the eternal one
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:39.880]   the ageless one
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:40.880]   the alpha
[01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:41.880]   and the omega
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:42.880]   the one who was
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:43.880]   who is
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:44.880]   and who is to come
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:45.880]   the omnipotent one
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.880]   he breathes his last
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:49.880]   and yields his spirit
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:54.880]   death
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:57.880]   death falls upon Christ
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:58.880]   death falls upon Christ
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:02.880]   the death
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:03.880]   that is inevitable to us all
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:04.880]   because of our sin
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:06.880]   falls upon the sinless one
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:11.880]   that's impossible
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:21.880]   Jerry Bridges says
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:23.880]   man's sin was not a mere paper debt
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.880]   it was not a hypothetical debt
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:27.880]   it was an actual legal debt
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:28.880]   it was Christ's own flesh
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:29.880]   that was nailed to the cross
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:31.880]   as he was made sin on our behalf
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:33.880]   paying our legal debt
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:34.880]   costs Christ
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:35.880]   agonizing pain
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:36.880]   and separation from his father
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:37.880]   as he bore the full force
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:38.880]   of God's wrath
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:39.880]   against the offense of sin
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:40.880]   and at the cross
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.880]   Christ extinguished
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:42.880]   the wrath of God
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:43.880]   toward believing sinners
[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:44.880]   by his own bloody death
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:45.880]   thereby paying
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:46.880]   the full legal debt
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:47.880]   due by sinners
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:51.880]   so on this Good Friday
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:52.880]   Jesus accomplishes
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:53.880]   the first half
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:54.880]   of what is needed
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:55.880]   for our salvation
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:56.880]   he pays the punishment
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:57.880]   of eternal death
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:58.880]   for all those
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:21:59.880]   who had placed
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:00.880]   their faith in him
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:01.880]   and remember
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:02.880]   death is not
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:03.880]   a simple annihilation
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:04.880]   it is not a simple
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:05.880]   just conclusion
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:06.880]   to his life
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:07.880]   it is taking on
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:08.880]   eternal death
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.880]   if our debt
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:11.880]   is eternal death
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:13.880]   then what was accomplished
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:14.880]   in Christ
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:15.880]   is that he takes on
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:17.880]   eternal death
[01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:19.880]   a perpetual
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:20.880]   continuous death
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:21.880]   that knows no end
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:22.880]   a worm that never dies
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:23.880]   a fire that is never quenched
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:25.880]   was poured out
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:26.880]   upon Christ
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:28.880]   when he yields his spirit
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.880]   it was not the people
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:31.880]   that held him there
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:32.880]   it was not the nails
[01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:33.880]   that held him there
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:34.880]   it was not his physical humanity
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:35.880]   that was just ending
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:36.880]   that held him there
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.880]   or it was not the end
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:39.880]   of his existence
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:40.880]   in such a physical manner
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:42.880]   what was happening
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:43.880]   on that cross
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:44.880]   is that he yielded
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:45.880]   his spirit
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:46.880]   that he chose
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:47.880]   to march
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:48.880]   to physical
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:49.880]   and spiritual death
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:52.880]   that he died
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.880]   that's Good Friday
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:59.880]   and so
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.880]   the story concludes
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:04.880]   at least of this portion
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:05.880]   in verse 51
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:06.880]   and behold
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:07.880]   the veil of the temple
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:08.880]   was torn in two
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:09.880]   from top to bottom
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:10.880]   and the earth shook
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:11.880]   and the rocks were split
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:12.880]   the tombs were opened
[01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:13.880]   and many bodies of the saints
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:14.880]   who had fallen asleep
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:15.880]   were raised
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:16.880]   and coming out of the tombs
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:17.880]   after his resurrection
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:18.880]   they entered the holy city
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:19.880]   and appeared to many
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:20.880]   now the centurion
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:21.880]   and those who were with him
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:22.880]   were looking over Jesus
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:23.880]   when they saw the earthquake
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:24.880]   and the things
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:25.880]   that were happening
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:26.880]   became very frightened
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:27.880]   and said
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:28.880]   truly this was
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:29.880]   the son of God
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:32.880]   we ask the question
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:33.880]   how could a good God
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:34.880]   allow there to be
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:35.880]   eternal death
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:37.880]   the proper question is
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:38.880]   why would a good God
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:39.880]   send his son
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:40.880]   to take this
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:46.880]   but that is the gospel
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:49.880]   what we see
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:50.880]   is how much God loves us
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:52.880]   and it makes no sense
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:55.880]   that what we see
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:56.880]   with Jesus
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:57.880]   marching through
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:23:58.880]   the spitting
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:00.880]   the stripping
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:01.880]   the mocking
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:02.880]   the jamming of thorns
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:03.880]   onto his head
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:05.880]   the beating
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:06.880]   the tearing him apart
[01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:09.880]   piercing him
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.880]   all of that
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:14.880]   to a people who wanted him dead
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:15.880]   he made no move
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:17.880]   to protect himself
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.880]   he made no move
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:20.880]   to stop
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:21.880]   what was occurring
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:23.880]   because he wanted
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:24.880]   to save the very people
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:25.880]   who were nailing him
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:26.880]   to the cross
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:30.880]   that's how much God loves us
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.880]   that he would
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:33.880]   that a father would send
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:34.880]   his only son
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:35.880]   knowing that this would happen
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:38.880]   that a son would lay down
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:39.880]   his life for us
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:40.880]   willingly
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:43.880]   the greatest problem
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:44.880]   of humanity is death
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.880]   it's not your unpaid bills
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:47.880]   it is not your health problem
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:48.880]   it is not the broken
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:49.880]   relationship that is
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:50.880]   in your life
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:51.880]   they are not
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:52.880]   unrealized dreams
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:53.880]   they are not things
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:54.880]   that we do not have
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:55.880]   our biggest problem
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:56.880]   is our sin
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:57.880]   and the death
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:58.880]   that it brings
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:24:59.880]   and all other issues
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:00.880]   we have in life
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:01.880]   are symptoms of that
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:02.880]   and tonight
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:03.880]   just to conclude here
[01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:05.880]   is that the cross then
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:06.880]   says
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:08.880]   I like the way
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:09.880]   Martin Lloyd-Jones puts it
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:11.880]   says that the cross
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:12.880]   declares
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.880]   the cross proclaims
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.880]   that by the story we read
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:18.880]   that he demands of us
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:19.880]   to repent
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:21.880]   of our sins
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:23.880]   that that death
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:24.880]   that is inevitably
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:25.880]   coming for us all
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:29.880]   if we are to repent
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:30.880]   of our sins
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:31.880]   and place our faith
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:32.880]   in the Christ
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:33.880]   who did this for us
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.880]   that we will be saved
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:37.880]   from that death
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:40.880]   I would like us
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:41.880]   as we enter
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:42.880]   into a time of communion
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:43.880]   to take time
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:44.880]   to think about our sins
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:45.880]   to pull that together
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:46.880]   with reality
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:47.880]   as we think about
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:49.880]   what it is
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:50.880]   that communion is
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:53.880]   I'm going to take a moment
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:54.880]   to pray for us
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:55.880]   and then we'll enter
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:56.880]   into this time together
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:06.880]   Heavenly Father
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:07.880]   I pray God
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:09.880]   that as the sermon ends
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:11.880]   and as a time
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:12.880]   for our reflection begins
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:14.880]   Lord that your spirit
[01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:15.880]   would be powerfully moving
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:16.880]   in a way
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:17.880]   that my words could not
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:20.880]   and Father
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:21.880]   where my words lack
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.880]   God I please
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:24.880]   I pray to you right now
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:25.880]   that you would do
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:26.880]   a great work in the hearts
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:28.880]   Father to show us
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:29.880]   our great need for you
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:31.880]   to turn away
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:32.880]   from the sins
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:33.880]   that we are living in
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:36.880]   to turn in gratitude
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:37.880]   towards the Christ
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:39.880]   who would do this
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:42.880]   so Father
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:43.880]   I pray that your gospel
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.880]   your cross
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:46.880]   would preach
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:47.880]   and proclaim
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:48.880]   that it would declare
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:50.880]   to everyone of our hearts
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.880]   what is needed of us
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:53.880]   that it might move us
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:54.880]   to repentance
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.880]   in Jesus name we pray
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:56.880]   Amen
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.880]   Well we're going to be
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.880]   doing this communion
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:00.880]   and we always want to remember
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:01.880]   the importance
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:02.880]   and seriousness
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:03.880]   of participating
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:04.880]   in the Lord's table
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:05.880]   and tonight is especially important
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:06.880]   because we have many visitors
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:07.880]   with us
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.880]   for us who believe
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:10.880]   in the authority
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:11.880]   of the scriptures
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:12.880]   this communion
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:13.880]   is one of two ordinances
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:16.880]   there are instructions
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:17.880]   given by Christ
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:18.880]   to us
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:19.880]   the church
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:20.880]   and so Jesus gave
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:21.880]   this symbol
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:22.880]   as a symbol
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:23.880]   and a reminder to us
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:25.880]   and we are to continually
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:26.880]   regularly
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:27.880]   in remembrance
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:28.880]   do what he has called us to
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:29.880]   until he returns
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:30.880]   at his second coming
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.880]   and so tonight
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:33.880]   what we're doing
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:34.880]   is taking up these elements
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:35.880]   and it is only
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:36.880]   for the Christian
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:37.880]   it is only for the believer
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:38.880]   who has been baptized
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:39.880]   who has declared
[01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:40.880]   and proclaimed
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:41.880]   their faith in Christ
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:42.880]   so if that is not you
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:43.880]   we pray
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:44.880]   we please ask
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:45.880]   that you do not
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:46.880]   participate
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:47.880]   in communion tonight
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:48.880]   do not come up
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:49.880]   do not take up the elements
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:51.880]   if you are in a place
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:53.880]   of unconfessed sin
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:55.880]   we also ask you
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:56.880]   to stay in your seats
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:58.880]   and at least take this moment
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:27:59.880]   to repent of your sin
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:01.880]   and that means
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:02.880]   to turn away
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:03.880]   and to make a concerted
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:05.880]   decisive
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:06.880]   action tonight
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:07.880]   to say
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:08.880]   that I will
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:09.880]   no longer
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:10.880]   walk down this path
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:12.880]   and then
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:13.880]   and only then
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:14.880]   as you have
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:15.880]   repented
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:16.880]   and turned away
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:17.880]   from your sin
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:18.880]   to come
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:19.880]   and take
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:20.880]   the elements with us
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:21.880]   in 1 Corinthians 11 23
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:22.880]   it says
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:23.880]   for I received
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:24.880]   from the Lord
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:25.880]   that which I also
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:26.880]   delivered to you
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:27.880]   that the Lord Jesus
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:28.880]   in the night
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:29.880]   in which you was betrayed
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:30.880]   took bread
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:31.880]   and when he had
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:32.880]   given thanks
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:33.880]   he broke it
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:34.880]   and said
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:35.880]   this is my body
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:36.880]   which is for you
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:37.880]   do this in remembrance
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:38.880]   of me
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:39.880]   for as often
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:40.880]   as you drink it
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:41.880]   in remembrance of me
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:42.880]   for as often
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:43.880]   as you eat this bread
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:44.880]   and drink the cup
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:45.880]   you proclaim
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:46.880]   the Lord's death
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:47.880]   until he comes
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:48.880]   therefore
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:49.880]   whoever eats the bread
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:50.880]   or drinks the cup
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:51.880]   of the Lord
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:52.880]   in an unworthy manner
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:53.880]   shall be guilty
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:54.880]   of the body
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:55.880]   and the blood
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:56.880]   of the Lord
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:57.880]   but a man must
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:58.880]   examine himself
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:28:59.880]   and in so doing
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:00.880]   he is to eat of the bread
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:01.880]   and drink of the cup
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:02.880]   for he who eats
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:03.880]   and drinks
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:04.880]   eats and drinks
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:05.880]   judgment to himself
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:06.880]   if he does not judge
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:07.880]   the body rightly
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:08.880]   and the blood of the Lord
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:09.880]   in his mouth
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:10.880]   and drink of the cup
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:11.880]   and drink of the blood
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:12.880]   of the Lord
