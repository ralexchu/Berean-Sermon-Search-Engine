[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.080]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 13.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.160]   And we're going to be looking at verse 5 and 6 this morning.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.760]   Hebrews chapter 13 verses 5 and 6.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.280]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.240]   Make sure that your character is free from the love of money, being content with what
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.560]   you have.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.160]   For he himself has said, "I will never desert you, nor will I ever forsake you."
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.200]   So that we confidently say, "The Lord is my helper, I will not be afraid.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.160]   What will man do to me?"
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.800]   Let's pray.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.100]   Heavenly Father, we praise you.
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.720]   We thank you.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.720]   We ask, Lord God, that what you have ordained your word to be, your very breath, would cause
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.400]   us, Lord God, to see a greater glimpse of your glory.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.200]   Search us and know us and see if there's any hurtful ways in us, that we may be sanctified,
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.200]   that your word would judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart, that we may live
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.120]   lives truly worthy of the gospel that you've called us to.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.640]   So we pray for your grace this morning.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.640]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.640]   Amen.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.440]   Some of you who may have been following the news this week, there was a lot of controversy
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.440]   around Facebook.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.120]   Some of you guys may have heard of it or read it because a whistleblower from the company
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.960]   came out and basically said that she has evidence that Facebook has been deliberately and willfully
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:39.320]   knowing that the material that they are exposing the people to are harming their people, and
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.080]   yet for profit, because they want more people to be on there, that they're deliberately
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.240]   allowing these things to happen.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.520]   And so there's been a huge controversy, a lot of talk in Congress, talking about splitting
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.080]   up Facebook and that they can't allow this to happen.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.880]   And my response when I heard all of this was, "No duh."
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.840]   Why is anybody even surprised that a company who's there for the purpose of profit would
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.520]   be willing to do something that they know would be harmful for people for their own
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.600]   profit?
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.840]   And to think that Facebook is the only one guilty of this, that's as naive as we can
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.840]   get.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.600]   The researchers say that an average American, by the time he's 20 years old, have watched
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.600]   over one million commercials.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.440]   One million.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.880]   Every one of those commercials, billions of dollars of research goes into it to get you
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.040]   to buy something that you may not actually even need, to go places and want things that
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.680]   you don't really need.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.240]   People spending money that they don't really have to get things that you don't really need.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.520]   So to think that Facebook, "Oh, they got caught trying to make a profit doing something that
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.960]   may be unethical."
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.120]   Do you think that doesn't happen in every TV show that you watch?
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.520]   That they are pushing an agenda that it may not be good for us?
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.480]   Every Disney movie you watch, if you've been watching it and you haven't filtered what
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:14.600]   you've been watching, have been planting seeds in your head that we're all aerials, right?
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.480]   That my life is no good, but something good is out there and I got to run away from my
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.480]   parents to get there.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.200]   And that's kind of like the theme of every Disney movie.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.200]   There's a reason why I pick on Disney, right?
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.880]   And it's not just Disney, right?
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.880]   It's not just Disney.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.300]   The whole world functions like this.
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.840]   You think the movies that you watch don't have an agenda?
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.240]   That they're trying to get you to think certain things, to have a certain bent?
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.640]   You think the media, right?
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.240]   You think the news outlets don't have an agenda that somehow they're trying to get you to
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.200]   train and to think a certain way?
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.800]   And so they're divulging information that is convenient, bent toward one way or the
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.840]   other.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.600]   Even your history.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.540]   History also comes through certain channels.
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.840]   So they're not just giving facts.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.920]   They're picking and choosing what are some things so that they can paint history a certain
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.920]   way.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.200]   Our whole educational system.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.400]   Do you think that they don't have an agenda?
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.360]   You think the people who pick curriculum don't have certain things, ideas that they want
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.600]   to implant into our children?
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.880]   Our whole world system has an agenda.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.840]   So to just get surprised like, "What?
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.520]   Facebook is allowing harmful material for the purpose of profit?"
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.600]   To think that they're the only ones is naive.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.560]   The Bible clearly says the God of this age is Satan.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.560]   The word for age here is not cosmos.
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.240]   It's not the world.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.400]   God is the creator of the world.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.160]   The words there is "ion."
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.520]   Age meaning what is popular.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.240]   Age meaning what the philosophies and the values of the world.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.360]   Satan is the God of that.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.480]   So the Bible says that we have an enemy who is like a roaring lion seeking someone to
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.480]   devour.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:04.520]   His primary avenue in the way that he devours is to infiltrate our thoughts and our hearts
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.160]   away from God.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.000]   And so to think that you and I are just kind of, just kind of existing in this world without
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.040]   any specific agendas that are trying to deliberately attack your thoughts.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.960]   So that's, there's a reason why the Bible says, "Do not be conformed to this world,
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.640]   but be transformed by," what?
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.160]   By the renewing of your mind.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.960]   And how do you renew your mind?
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.800]   According to the word of God.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.160]   So when we become a Christian, our whole process of sanctification is testing everything that
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.380]   you and I have been taught with God's word.
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.380]   Is it biblical?
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.280]   Is it not biblical?
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.400]   Because if you don't test it with the word of God, even the very things that you think
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.320]   are righteous and unrighteous may have been influenced by the God of this age.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.120]   What you think is good and what you think is bad, because Satan has actively trying
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:03.520]   to implant thoughts and desires in our heart that is contrary to what God has desired.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.280]   That is not just Facebook.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.240]   The whole world system works that way.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.160]   So that's why if you're not actively in the word of God and allow the word of God to test
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.200]   everything that you think and do, you may already have been influenced and not understanding,
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:26.520]   not knowing, or maybe not aware that satanic thoughts have been implanted in your head.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.720]   First John 2, 16 describes how Satan works.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.160]   It says, "For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.080]   the boastful pride of life is not from the Father, but is from the world."
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:45.120]   He basically, in this text, it summarizes the way that Satan works to implant seeds
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.920]   to draw us away from God.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.480]   If you look at this pattern, lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, the boastful pride of life,
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.340]   you see that exact same pattern when Satan takes, or when Jesus is out in the wilderness
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.160]   and he is tested before he starts his public ministry.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.160]   Lust of the flesh.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:09.840]   Remember, Jesus is hungry after 40 days and he says, "Turn this stone into bread."
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.960]   And so he couldn't get Jesus to stumble that way, lust of the flesh.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.400]   And then he shows him all of his kingdom, Satan's kingdom, and he says, "If you would
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.800]   bow down to me, I will give you all of this kingdom."
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.160]   He said, "Lust of the eyes."
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.200]   And then that didn't work, so he takes him up to the temple and then he says, "If you
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.960]   jump down, if you really are the son of God, prove yourself and jump down and angels will
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.960]   come."
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.720]   Boastful pride of life.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:42.480]   That same pattern, we see the same pattern in Genesis chapter 3 verse 6.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:50.260]   When Satan comes to tempt Eve, it says this, "When the woman saw that the tree was good
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:56.540]   for food, lust of the flesh, and that it was delight to the eyes, lust of the eyes, and
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:02.040]   that the tree was desirable to make one wise, the boastful pride of life, she took from
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:08.960]   its fruit and ate, and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate."
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:15.520]   So satanic attack, the desire, instilling this desire in us and then showing us what
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:21.780]   we, to tempt us and to get us to covet, and then to pursue that so that we can get ahead
[00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:27.680]   of everybody else, is not unique to Facebook.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.960]   This is satanic attack on all of us, constantly.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.560]   This coveting in our hearts.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.320]   The text that we're looking at when it says, "Do not covet," right?
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.160]   "Do not desire money.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.120]   Let your life be free from the character, free from the love of money."
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.240]   Of all the commandments that are listed here in Hebrews, this is one of those commandments
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.200]   where it's like, "Well, I'm not materialistic.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.760]   I don't drive fancy cars and I don't look at million-dollar homes and say, 'Oh, I need
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.840]   to have that,' and so therefore maybe I don't really struggle with this desire.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:07.440]   I want to show you just how prevalent this is and why this is so important."
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:14.640]   So the first point I want to take you through is coveting is the root of many other sins.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.960]   It's the beginning of all the other sins.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.160]   He says, "Make sure that your character is free from the love of money."
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.740]   He's not just talking about looking at something and saying, "Oh, I want that."
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.860]   He's talking about the character, your very personhood.
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:35.520]   In the other translation, ESV, in the NIV, it says, "Keep your life free from the love
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.520]   of money."
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:41.560]   He's talking about an individual who is continually pursuing after things that have been planted
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.560]   in their heads.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.320]   Maybe it's something that you saw.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.200]   Maybe it's just a desire that you have.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.440]   Maybe it's just to compete with your neighbors to get ahead in life.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:57.640]   But you're pursuing these things, not realizing there's a deliberate satanic attack to draw
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.480]   you away from God.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.440]   So he's talking about an individual where his life pattern is given in.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.400]   He could come to church on Sunday.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.740]   He might even be a Sunday school teacher.
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:13.600]   But his general character is pursuing what everybody else is pursuing.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.620]   And it may not be sinful.
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.220]   There's nothing specifically to point out and say, "Oh, that's wrong.
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.740]   The Bible says this is wrong."
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:24.740]   But your general pursuit are the covetous things that you have allowed into yourself
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:30.180]   and you're making decisions and you're pursuing certain things that is contrary to what God
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.180]   desires.
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:40.220]   In 1 Timothy 6, 9-10, it says, "But those who want to get rich, those who pursue riches,
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:44.620]   fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.700]   into ruin and destruction."
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:53.620]   If your life is patterned by pursuit of getting riches.
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.540]   He said, "That is the root cause of all these other sins.
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.140]   For the love of money is the root of all sorts of evil.
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.900]   And some by longing for it and have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.900]   with many griefs."
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:18.580]   Again, let me emphasize, when he says, "Love of money, coveting of money is the root behind
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.740]   many other sins."
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.960]   That's what he is saying.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.280]   Why did Satan fall?
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.360]   What was the cause of Satan's fall?
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.840]   Satan fell because he coveted God's glory.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.480]   Why did Adam and Eve fall?
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.920]   Because Adam and Eve coveted God's knowledge.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.720]   Why did Cain commit murder?
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.640]   Because he coveted his relationship with God's relationship with Abel.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.160]   Saul, King Saul, why did he fall?
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.080]   Because he coveted what other kings had.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:56.520]   And then after he was rejected, he spent the rest of his life coveting what David had.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:02.040]   Ananias and Sapphira, the first people who get killed because of their sin.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.920]   What was their sin?
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.400]   They coveted other men with reputation because they were giving their property and giving
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.440]   it to the church.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.960]   And so they coveted the reputation of godliness.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.760]   So they lied to the church.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.600]   But it was coveting that led them there.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:26.360]   James says in James 4, 1-4, the root cause that leads to murder is coveting.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.960]   James 4, 1-4, "What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you?
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.120]   It is not the source of your pleasures that wage war in your members."
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:40.280]   He says, "Coveting is the source of all kinds of dissensions in your family, in the church,
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.840]   with relationship," he says, "because you have these desires that are not met."
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:49.760]   Now, the desires that is not met doesn't just have to be material goods.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.800]   It could be your reputation.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.840]   It could be comfort.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.760]   It could be whatever it may be.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.920]   There's unmet desires.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.340]   You covet something that you're not getting.
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.320]   Maybe it's respect.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.360]   Maybe it's acknowledgement.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.360]   Whatever it may be.
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.360]   Maybe it's comfort.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.400]   Whatever it may be, it is unmet desires that are causing frustration in your heart.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.520]   You lust and you do not have, so you commit murder.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.640]   The majority of people may not make that leap in committing murder.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.280]   Remember what Jesus says?
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.680]   The root cause of murder is bitterness and hatred.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.600]   And the root cause of bitterness and hatred, he says, is coveting.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.280]   He said that's what ultimately leads to.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.520]   You are envious and cannot obtain, so you fight and you quarrel.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.640]   You do not have because you do not ask.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.320]   You ask and you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives so that you may spend
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.600]   it on your pleasures.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:43.360]   He also says the reason behind false teaching is also coveting.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:48.660]   In 2 Peter 2.3, "And in their greed they will exploit you with false words.
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:53.600]   Their judgment from long ago is not idle and their destruction is not asleep."
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:59.060]   He says the motivation behind why these men were going around teaching false doctrines,
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.320]   he said it was greed.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.260]   Some were pursuing sordid gain.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.280]   Some were simply pursuing popularity.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:13.600]   And even today, it's obvious when somebody is pursuing, preaching the false gospel in
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.800]   order for financial gain, you know, that's the health and wealth gospel people.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.720]   It's clear why they're doing it.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.280]   It's their way of getting what the world has to offer, but they're doing it in the name
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.400]   of Christ.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.440]   But it's not limited to money.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.020]   False teaching comes out because there's some benefit.
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:36.840]   You tickle people's ears because by tickling people's ears, you may get a bigger church,
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.200]   a bigger following, sell more books.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:46.360]   But he says the fundamental reason or the seed that motivates a false teacher, he said
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.300]   it's his greed.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.440]   His desire is coveting in his own heart.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.760]   Look at the Ten Commandments.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.940]   The root cause of why people would commit or break the Ten Commandments.
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:04.500]   You ever wonder why the Israelites would ever even be tempted by false idols?
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.900]   Wonder what they had in God.
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:11.000]   I mean, what God actually showed, what among their idols actually showed up, split the
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.720]   Red Sea, give them water miraculously, and then when they complained, he would give them
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.920]   quail from the sky, and then he would destroy nations whoever stood.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.520]   I mean, they saw miracles after miracles after miracles, but they kept on being tested and
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.120]   wanted to go worship Asherah or Baal.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.760]   Like you ever see that idol?
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.760]   It's just a stick.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:36.720]   I literally like, why would they be, why would that even be a temptation?
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.720]   If I showed up one day and saying like, "Worship this right here."
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.840]   Who would be tempted, right?
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.680]   If you bow down, you worship this right here.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.960]   Asherah is just a piece of stick.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:55.080]   What was their temptation that led them to chase after these idols?
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.340]   They were going to land and maybe their farm wasn't working as well, or maybe families
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.640]   were having a hard time having children.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.840]   Whatever wealth, whatever coveting that they coveted in their heart that they didn't have,
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.880]   and God wasn't giving it to them, and then they look at the Canaanites and they have
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.880]   it.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.380]   And so the reason why they ended up worshiping Asherah and Baal and all the other idols is
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:24.040]   because through that they were hoping that what they coveted that they can have also.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.240]   So it wasn't that they were attracted to this pole or this piece of rock.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.880]   They thought that maybe if we worshiped it, we can have what they have.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:37.000]   So the reason why they kept on going after idols was the coveting that they had in their
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.600]   hearts that was not being fulfilled at the time that they desired.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.480]   The second commandment, "You shall not make any graven images of him."
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.000]   Why would they do that?
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.720]   They would make an image and say, "This is Yahweh," because the Yahweh that they could
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.380]   not see wasn't giving them what they wanted.
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:02.600]   So they were creating an image of God that they wanted, much like today.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:08.100]   So much of the Jesus that is being worshipped in the church is a graven image of Jesus.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:13.560]   It's not the image that's in the Bible because the Jesus of the Bible is not giving them
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:18.440]   what they desire, so they create a new Jesus that will give them what they want.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.340]   What was the root cause of that?
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.340]   Coveting.
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.240]   "You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain."
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.280]   Today when we think of that, when we look at that passage, it means that you can't say
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:35.980]   God and then as a curse word, which is obviously part of it, but the true application of this
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:40.860]   is using the Lord's name to get what you want.
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:41.860]   That's coveting.
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.640]   The root cause of breaking the third commandment is coveting.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.500]   Remember the Sabbath, to keep it holy.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.880]   Why were they breaking the Sabbath?
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:54.020]   Because they wanted to work and make money instead of worshipping God.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.120]   They wanted to get ahead.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:59.100]   So the reason behind that is coveting.
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.100]   Honor your father and mother.
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:04.780]   Now I'm not saying that this is true of every instance, but part of the reason why children
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:09.800]   rebel against their parents is because the parents are not giving them what they covet.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:15.060]   So the root cause for many who rebel is coveting.
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.660]   And we've already read in James, it says, "You shall not murder."
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.920]   That is coveting that leads to bitterness and conflict that leads to murder.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.480]   So the root cause of murder, he says, is coveting.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.900]   You should not commit adultery.
[00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.560]   Adultery is coveting someone else's wife.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.440]   You should not steal.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.180]   It's coveting someone else's stuff.
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.940]   You should not bear witness against your neighbor.
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:42.280]   And part of the reason why there's bearing witness, false witnesses in conflict, again
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.540]   in the book of James, it says it's because unmet desires, coveting.
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.740]   And then it ends with, "You shall not covet."
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:57.460]   If we don't understand the deadliness of this sin, we can kind of read all of this,
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:01.520]   "Don't murder, don't commit adultery, don't steal, don't bear false witnesses."
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:06.580]   But coveting is just, "Oh, I desire that."
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.860]   You look at advertisement, it's like, "Oh, I want that."
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.900]   You pick up a habit and it's like, "Oh, I want more of that."
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:19.760]   And we won't think of all the things that we are warned against, coveting seems to be
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.620]   the most innocuous, the least dangerous.
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:30.340]   Yet he says coveting is the root cause of why there's human rebellion.
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:34.140]   All of mankind fell because of what?
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.140]   Because of coveting.
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:41.300]   Because Adam and Eve wanted something that God didn't give them and they were willing
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.400]   to get it.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.460]   Coveting is the reason why so many people fall away from their faith.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.660]   We're saying, "Well, some people may fall away if persecution comes."
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:57.460]   The government is putting pressure and we actually have to sacrifice.
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.580]   At least from what I've seen, when persecution comes, church gets strengthened.
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.340]   People who may not be Christians fall out and then true Christians end up strengthening
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.340]   their faith.
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.020]   So persecution has never been bad for the church.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:15.620]   Majority of people who walk away from their faith simply drift away because they have
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.920]   unmet desires that's not being fulfilled.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:24.160]   So they're willing to compromise and go after things because God's not giving it to them.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.340]   So they simply drift.
[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:31.620]   Luke chapter 8, 14, it says, "The seed which fell among the thorns, these are the ones
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:37.060]   who have heard and as they go on their way, they are choked with worries and riches and
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:41.620]   pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to maturity."
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.860]   These are people who hear it, seem like they have genuine faith, but because they've embraced
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:50.940]   coveting in their life and it's not huge things, "Oh, I want to be a multi-billionaire."
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.220]   It's the little things.
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.940]   It's all these advertisements that we see and we see what other people have.
[00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.500]   I want some of that too.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.500]   I don't want to be greedy.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.500]   I'm a Christian.
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.740]   I don't want to be materialistic, but what's wrong?
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.780]   I want to take care of my children.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:12.540]   And so we make small compromises and next thing we know, that's what we pursue.
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.780]   And I believe that that's probably the greatest danger.
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:21.700]   What is hurting the church more than anything else is allowing coveting to creep into our
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.980]   hearts.
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.500]   Luke chapter 16, 13, it says, "No servant can serve two masters, for either he will
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:33.980]   hate the one and love the other or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other."
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.420]   You cannot serve God and wealth.
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.980]   You cannot.
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:45.500]   And yet we have churches filled with people who's trying to prove God wrong.
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:50.300]   Either we don't believe it, we reject that, or we hope out of all the things that God
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.580]   says that this one isn't true.
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:22:00.060]   You cannot covet and pursue the things of this world and serve God at the same time.
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.060]   There is no in between.
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.060]   He says, you cannot.
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:08.060]   And millions and millions of people who have gone before us have tested this and have proven
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.900]   to be wrong.
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:15.420]   And yet every generation, there rises a new group of people who are testing God and say,
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.080]   you know, maybe I'll try it.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.860]   And then we create a new kind of Christianity that has nothing to do with the Bible.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:27.300]   The whole book of Hebrews is a warning against this, to not to drift.
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.020]   Why do you think they were drifting?
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.300]   Why do you think they were drifting?
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:37.220]   They weren't drifting because of, you know, like there's division in the...
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.340]   They were simply drifting because they just looked at the world that they left and they
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.540]   started coveting that again.
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.980]   They just started compromising, just start slowly drifting away into that.
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:49.540]   Pursue a little bit of this and a little bit of that.
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.380]   Next thing you know, that's who you are.
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.660]   That's what you pursue.
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:23:02.260]   Turmoil and anxiety come from not having what you want or afraid of losing what we have.
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:08.900]   And so either of these motivations that we covet in our hearts causes us to pursue things
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.940]   that have nothing to do with God.
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:17.880]   Yesterday at the conference, one of the speakers, he mentioned like, you know, that we ask these
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.460]   two questions, right?
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:23.460]   What is it that you want that you do not have?
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.960]   And what is it that you have that you do not want?
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:32.360]   The root cause of what penetrates into our lives and then leads us to all these other
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.360]   kinds of sin are the small compromise that we make and we allow.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.420]   And the next thing you know, that's exactly who we are.
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.540]   We just happen to go to church on Sunday.
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:44.320]   We just happen to make a decision at one point in our life.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.420]   But that is not our pursuit.
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.580]   So you see how, why this is so important?
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:56.080]   Because if we don't recognize this sin, then automatically we start drifting toward the
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.080]   things that this sin leads us to.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.380]   But the second part of this is contentment comes from valuing God above everything else.
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:10.560]   He says, "But being content with what you have."
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:17.960]   When you see coveting, and he says that the way to combat that coveting is to be content
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.960]   with what you have.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.960]   Well, how do you do that?
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:24.200]   Do you just sit there and say, "Be content, be content."
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.200]   How do you do that?
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:31.400]   How do you not covet when you're living in a world of nice things?
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.800]   Right?
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.760]   I look at some of your Instagram pictures.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.760]   It's like, "Covet.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.020]   I want to go there.
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.020]   One day I want to go there."
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.920]   You know, I see what you eat.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.000]   It's like, "Oh, that looks good.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.040]   I want to eat that."
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.360]   You know, I see what you drive.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.240]   It's like, "Oh, that'd be nice.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.560]   Oh, that bed seems comfortable.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.960]   It'd be nice to have that."
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:57.320]   How do you not covet when you're living in a world filled with things that are easily
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.560]   accessible, especially to us?
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.000]   I mean, you show that to certain parts of the world.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   It's like Superman flying.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.440]   It's just fantasy.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.560]   But for us, it's a reality.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.640]   If we want it, we can have it.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:14.800]   If we just are wise with our money and plan well, buy Bitcoin early, you know what I mean?
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.880]   There's ways to get to all of this stuff are really at our fingertips.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:24.720]   So how do you and I live in a world filled with temptation and not allow coveting to
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.320]   penetrate into our hearts?
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:33.600]   Well, one, we need to recognize coveting when it's there and not to excuse that and say,
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.280]   "Well, you know, I'm just taking care of my kids.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.280]   What's wrong with that?
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.280]   You know, where do you draw the line?"
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:42.760]   And all of these things that we use to allow this coveting to creep into our hearts, and
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.480]   then we gradually start to pursue that.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.640]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:53.200]   If you were to go back in time, what period of your life would you want to be?
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.840]   Now, some of you guys are there right now.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.800]   You just don't know it.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:06.840]   Most people who graduate college and ask the 24, 25-year-olds who've already experienced
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:12.840]   bitterness of life because they're working full time, and then they say, "Man, you had
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.840]   it so good in college," right?
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:21.080]   They're already grizzled after a year and a half of working.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:24.560]   Most people will point back to a certain period of life, right?
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.720]   Most people my age will say somewhere around 30.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.600]   I don't want to be too young.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.600]   You know, I need some respect.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.640]   You know what I mean?
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:36.480]   So at 30, when the kids were young, they're in the house, or we, you know, even though
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:41.160]   it was a difficult period of life, like financially, that's the period of life, like, when I fantasize,
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.680]   like, where would I be?
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:46.000]   When the children were young, we're in the house, right?
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.520]   But I was dirt poor during that period, right?
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:54.520]   I mean, we'd have to save up money to go to Korean barbecue.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.520]   We just didn't have money.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:00.040]   But yet, when I think about my past, that's the period that I have the fond memory of.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.960]   It's like, oh, when the children were young in the house, and they still thought I was
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.600]   cool, right?
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.340]   That's the period, right?
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:11.520]   Most of us will pick a period of life, and really, money, it doesn't have a lot to do
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.740]   with it.
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.060]   Most of us, the older we get, the more money we have.
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:19.800]   Maybe we made some poor decisions, and maybe some of us had less money now than when we
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.000]   were younger, but most of us, that's not true.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Most of us, the older we get, the more assets, the more money that we have, and yet, when
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.820]   you ask, what period of your life do you want to go back to, it's a period that has nothing
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.440]   to do with money.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:37.560]   And yet, if we talk about going for the future, like, oh, I wish that period would come, I
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.280]   wish the next period.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.640]   Many of our fantasies has to do with money.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:47.240]   If I can pay off the bills, if we had a little bit more, when the kids are a little bit older,
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:51.360]   and we didn't have this, and I can buy this house, and I can save up a little money, and
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.120]   I can retire and go here.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.840]   For whatever the reason, when we fantasize about the future, it has something to do with
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:02.920]   coveting, but when we look back at the past, it has nothing to do with money.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.240]   I'm not saying that this is true 100%.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.560]   I'm sure somebody after service is going to come up to me and prove me wrong.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.440]   You're that one exception, okay?
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.000]   Everybody else, most likely, this is true.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.600]   Why is that?
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.880]   Because Satan is clever.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.000]   Satan is clever.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.720]   Because he is attacking us, because he causes us to covet in our hearts, thinking that our
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.880]   happiness is going to come if we have this, and that's what causes us to pursue the things
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:34.320]   that when we look at the totality of life, doesn't even matter.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:40.720]   Satan isn't having what we want, but recognizing exactly what it is that we have, and that's
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.320]   the heart of what he gets to.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:48.200]   To fight coveting, he says, "For he himself has said, 'I will never desert you, nor will
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.360]   I ever forsake you.'"
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:57.640]   In the English, the dynamic of this passage really doesn't flesh out, because in the English,
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:02.040]   when we took grammar, they tell us you're never to use the two negative.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.680]   I will never not do this.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.440]   That's confusing, right?
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.440]   You're wrong.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.680]   You're not supposed to do that in grammar.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.800]   In English.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:14.880]   In the Greek, there's five negatives just in that short sentence.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.200]   In the Greek, it says, "No, never, not even, never, ever."
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.200]   That's what it says in the Greek.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:24.560]   There's five negatives in this one sentence.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.640]   Is that by accident?
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.720]   Of course it's not by accident.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:33.400]   In fact, Charles Spurgeon has a sermon on this specific text, and the title of his sermon
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.480]   is "Never, Never, Never, Never, Never."
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.040]   That's the title of his sermon.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:44.360]   Never, never, never, never, never.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.800]   It's not by accident.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:51.320]   It's not that the person who was writing this is really bad at grammar.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.720]   He's trying to make a point.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:59.000]   Of all the things that you covet and you desire in your heart, there's only one thing that
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.880]   will never disappoint you.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:05.360]   There's only one person that will never let you down.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.800]   There's only one promise that will always be fulfilled, and that's the point that he's
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:11.160]   trying to make.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:16.400]   That do not give in to your character or life where you're pursuing and coveting, and I
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.960]   want this and I want that.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:22.640]   He says, "Be content with what you have, because what you have, if you're a Christian, is a
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:31.960]   promise of God that says, 'I will never, ever, ever, never, ever forsake you.'"
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.400]   That is not by accident.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:40.960]   He's trying to instill in us that that's what Christian contentment looks like.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:46.000]   In Romans 8, 31-35, "What then shall we say to these things, if God is for us, who is
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.740]   against us?
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.560]   He who did not spare his own son, but delivered him for us all, how will he not also with
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:55.340]   him freely give us all things?"
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.000]   You and I know this passage so well.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.440]   Some of you probably have memorized this text, but a Christian who lives his life coveting
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:12.040]   the things of this world, discontent, it's not just, it doesn't make sense.
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:20.680]   It's ludicrous to believe that God loved us enough to send his only begotten son, his
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:25.160]   son, allowed him to suffer, absorb our sins.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:30.360]   He was forsaken so that we wouldn't be forsaken to confess that, to sing that, to memorize
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:37.360]   that, to study that, and then to leave the room thinking, "Is God going to take care
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.180]   of me?
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:43.000]   What if I give myself to him and he forgets me?
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Why is he not answering my prayers?
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.040]   Why is he not doing this?
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.240]   What if I don't get the promotion?
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.480]   What if I don't get this job?
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.080]   What if my business doesn't do well?"
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:54.400]   He says, "How will he not, if he gave his only begotten son, how will he not along with
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.320]   him give us all things?
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:01.600]   If he loved us enough to sacrifice his own son, would he sacrifice his own son and say,
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.800]   'Okay, now good, go, try to make it on your own.'"
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.200]   Does that make any sense?
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.560]   He says, "No, how will he not along with him give us all things?
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.480]   Who will bring a charge against God's elect?
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.280]   God is the one who justifies.
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.280]   Who is the one who condemns?
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.520]   Christ Jesus is the one who died.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.120]   Yes, rather who was raised.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:24.080]   Who was at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.800]   He didn't just justify us.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.360]   He continues to intercede on our behalf.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.520]   Who will separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:36.360]   Will tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?"
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:45.160]   In other words, never, ever, ever, ever, never, never will he forsake you.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.760]   That's what he's saying.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.640]   If you look at the Great Commission, right?
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:57.040]   If you look at the Great Commission, the disciples failed miserably just a few days before Jesus
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.560]   commissions them.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.840]   Imagine what the commission is.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:06.040]   The commission is gathering his disciples to go take the gospel to the remotest part
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.040]   of the world.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:12.560]   What he did, what God has been preparing since the beginning of the fall of man, that he
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.960]   promised that the seed of the woman is going to crush the head of the serpent, that he
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.960]   was going to come and do this.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:23.880]   So all of history from Genesis to Malachi to the showing up of Jesus was to prepare
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.400]   for this, for the gospel.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.640]   So right before they go out, they fail miserably.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.980]   In fact, the leader, Peter, fails the most miserably.
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.920]   In Jesus' face, he says, "I don't know him.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.920]   I don't know him.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.320]   I don't know him."
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.500]   Just a few days later, he commissions his disciples, "Go therefore make disciples of
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:44.500]   all the nations."
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:49.640]   Now in any other part of the world, if you want to be a CPA and you fail the test, you
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.280]   don't get to be a CPA.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:58.560]   If you're going into law and you don't pass the bar, you don't get to be a lawyer.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:06.200]   If you're in the medical field and you don't pass your test, you don't get to practice.
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.600]   These disciples before the Great Commission failed miserably.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.800]   It was only a few days.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.360]   And he sends them.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.740]   Generally speaking, how can they start new?
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:21.640]   Yeah, you wasted three years, but get somebody else who's not going to deny you.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.840]   But what does he say?
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.360]   "All authority in heaven and earth has been given to me.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.440]   Go make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.440]   Spirit.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.160]   And behold," what does he say?
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:37.720]   "I will be with you to the end of the age."
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:38.920]   He wasn't sending them.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.240]   He was going through them.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:44.440]   That's exactly what it says in Acts chapter 1.8.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.440]   They're ready to go.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.840]   He said, "No, no, no, you can't go.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.840]   You don't remember?
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.440]   You just failed.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.760]   If you go on your own strength, that's going to happen again.
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.040]   I'm going to send the Holy Spirit.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.440]   When he comes, you will receive power and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea,
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.740]   Samaria, to the ends of the earth."
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.680]   He wasn't just sending them.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.520]   He just chose them to use them.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:11.320]   And the promise to give them strength was, "I will be with you."
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.320]   That was his promise.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:18.760]   Again, "I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever forsake you."
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.840]   That was the same message all throughout Genesis.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:27.360]   Your success is not because you were great, it was because a greater number, that you're
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:32.760]   better trained or you have better leaders or you have better history or you have more
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.240]   money.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.800]   The only promise that he gave them is that you will be successful.
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:37.800]   What?
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.400]   Do not turn from my word to the left or to the right.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.720]   Have I not commanded you?
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:45.800]   Be courageous and lo, I am with you.
[00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:50.680]   Their whole success all throughout redemptive history was, "I will be with you.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.040]   I will never leave you.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.800]   Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever."
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.160]   Christian contentment isn't simply pursuing this world and getting certain things.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.680]   It's like, "Oh, I have money in the bank account."
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.680]   He says, "No.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.280]   We leave with all our heart the promise that God made."
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.280]   And that's why you and I are here.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.260]   That's why we sing these songs.
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.420]   That's why we do Bible study.
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:16.000]   That's why we memorize scripture, to be reminded again and again and again and again that our
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.520]   contentment is in Christ.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:27.400]   Jim Elliot, as you guys know, is famous for saying, "He is no fool who gives up what he
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:31.680]   cannot keep to have what he cannot lose."
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:35.440]   Interestingly speaking, I mean, Jim Elliot was a tall, handsome dude.
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.240]   He was the man on campus.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:41.200]   If you read his story, he said he was popular with the ladies.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.200]   He was athletic.
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.520]   He was very articulate.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:48.320]   I mean, he could have literally been used powerfully.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:53.640]   What a waste, this young man who's so gifted and talented, even in the eyes of the world,
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.640]   he's gifted.
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:37:00.120]   Couldn't he have lived longer and preached the gospel to more people instead of going
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:06.160]   into the weird part of the world and Ecuador and then dying early?
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:12.520]   See, humanly speaking, we could look at that and say, "What a waste.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.880]   What tragedy.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:18.960]   He could have been so useful for God with all the things that God had given him."
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.980]   And yet, he practiced what he wrote.
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:29.460]   He is no fool who gives up what he cannot keep to have what he cannot lose.
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.600]   His treasure was in Christ.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.520]   God used his death because it was in his hands, because God never left him.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:40.920]   Whether he lived a long life or a short life, God never left him as he promised.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:44.840]   This Psalm 23, this is a passage that we quote all the time.
[00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:47.840]   Some of you guys may have it as a plaque in your home.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.520]   "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.200]   He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.000]   He leads me beside quiet waters.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   He restores my soul.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.680]   He guides me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:02.840]   The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:07.520]   We quote that, we memorize that, we preach about that, but how many of us sitting here
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:13.680]   say, "The Lord is my shepherd, period."
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.840]   The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.560]   The Lord is my king.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.240]   The Lord is my savior.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:25.040]   The fundamental question for a Christian is not, "Is God good?"
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:30.800]   That's not the fundamental question because even Satan knows that.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.680]   The question is not, "Is God good?"
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:38.360]   The question is, "Is God enough?
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.440]   Is he enough?"
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.740]   You can covet the world and say God's good.
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.480]   You can be in the church, be a Sunday school teacher.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.480]   You can be a leader.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:53.200]   You can be a preacher and say God is good, but that's not the question that he asks and
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.520]   that's not the question that we need to be asking.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:59.960]   The question is, "Is he enough?"
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:05.560]   If he is not enough, you don't have to want to covet, you just do.
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:06.960]   Who doesn't want to live in a nice house?
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.680]   Who doesn't want to drive a nice car?
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.880]   Who doesn't want to have nice things?
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.120]   But in the end, we all know.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.440]   We all know.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:21.680]   Whether you die with a hundred million dollars in your pocket, whether you die with zero
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:25.480]   in your pocket, you die.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:31.560]   Whether your children are well taken care of, whether they have hardship, you die.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.560]   We don't know that.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.000]   I'm not saying anything controversial.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.240]   I'm not saying anything that's uniquely Christian.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.240]   We die.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:42.520]   And then compared to eternity, we live a blip and that's the reason why the psalmist says,
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:46.320]   "Help me to number my days.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:51.520]   Help me to know how short this life is so that I don't covet this period of my life
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.960]   that I forfeit this.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.680]   Help me to number my days so that I would know how short life is."
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:03.200]   You know, one of the benefits of getting older is this become more and more of a reality.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:07.840]   Man, 50 some years went by like nothing.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.320]   It's a blip.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:17.800]   Help me to live with that reality so that as a believer, that I would live with Christ
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.120]   in mind, with eternity in mind.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:28.480]   A covetous man can never be satisfied and a content man can never be shaken.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:39.000]   I had a friend who was making $250,000 a year and he has to work overtime to meet his needs,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   he says.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.680]   Now, most of us in this room who don't make that money sounds ridiculous, right?
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:49.800]   Most of us peasants in here, $250,000 is like, "What?"
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.920]   He said, "What?"
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:57.000]   But if you're making $500,000, you know exactly what he means.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.640]   You make $250,000 a year and you need to work overtime?
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:06.080]   Because when we covet, we don't covet down, we usually covet up.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:11.560]   I don't make anywhere near this kind of money so what I covet is in this room because this
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:14.000]   is what I see.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.640]   Your Teslas, I want it.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.840]   Your nice houses, I want it.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:26.360]   You know, your camping equipment, I need it.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:30.840]   What I covet is what I see because this is my socioeconomic status so what I'm surrounded
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.320]   by is what I covet.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:38.120]   If you start making $250,000, you're not coveting what you see in the parking lot because that's
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.800]   a reality for you.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:44.840]   You end up taking your tiny little boat that you paid $100,000 for and you're in the yacht
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:50.480]   club and the next guy shows up with a million dollar yacht, that's what you covet.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:56.200]   That's why somebody making $250,000 thinks like he doesn't have enough because that's
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.880]   the deception of this world.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:03.600]   Satan will, no matter what place you are in life, there will always be somebody ahead
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:09.600]   of you that you think that you need because that's the deception.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:13.760]   Majority of the people in the world look at what you and I have and it's a fantasy to
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:14.760]   them.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:15.760]   Garage sale.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.080]   You mentioned garage sale in Kenya.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.280]   What does that mean?
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.920]   You know, the excess stuff that we have that got outdated, you know what I mean?
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:27.440]   It was popular 20 years ago, it was no longer popular today so we're selling it, maybe sometimes
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.280]   giving it away.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.280]   What?
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:38.320]   Majority of the world, if you travel, they eat the same food.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.040]   Breakfast, lunch and dinner, seven days a week.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.040]   What?
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:46.160]   Today it's like, oh, I love sushi.
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.680]   And I've mentioned this enough on the pulpit where it's like, oh, let's go out to sushi.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.080]   I'm like, I'm tired.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.080]   I've had too much.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:58.480]   So I got to have Mexican food, Thai food the next day, Pho the next day, Korean the other
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:07.720]   day and then I got to go Italian the other day because we have access to all of it, right?
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.520]   That's the temptation where you and I are.
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:14.600]   We live in a fantasy world and compared to the rest of the world, the majority of us
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:22.960]   in this room think that if I just had the next, I should have bought that Bitcoin early.
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:29.080]   That Dogecoin, that Shiba Inu, whatever it is out there and you're fantasizing like I
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:30.800]   could have, I should have.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:35.220]   If I did and maybe the next one, maybe the next big one comes in, I'm not going to miss
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:42.520]   out on and your mind and heart is filled with these things because Satan uses that to draw
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:49.280]   us away from him and it leads to conflict, frustration and compromise.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:53.920]   You know what's interesting in John chapter 16, 33, after Jesus telling his disciples
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:58.280]   that he's going to leave and you can't come with me and then John chapter 15 he says,
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.980]   but you need to continue to abide in me.
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:05.740]   He says it over and over again, 11 times in John chapter 15, stay with me, remain with
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:08.080]   me, remain with me, remain with me.
[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:11.620]   Even as I go, if you want to bear fruit, you need to remain with me because I will never
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:12.620]   leave you.
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:15.480]   So don't leave me.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:19.640]   And in conclusion of that text in John 16, 33, it says, these things I have spoken to
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:23.880]   you so that in me you may have peace.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:28.840]   And then it says in the world you will have tribulation.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:33.400]   Wait a second, he said I'm praying so that you would have peace and then he says, but
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.320]   in this world you're going to have tribulation.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.320]   Which is it?
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.760]   Am I going to have peace or am I going to have tribulation?
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:43.640]   He says, but take courage, I have overcome the world.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:50.320]   The peace that he's telling us has nothing to do with this material world.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:53.640]   Coveting is more than just money.
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:56.200]   It's more than just things.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.760]   Things that we don't have, that we've convinced ourselves or Satan has convinced us that I
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:00.920]   need to have.
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.440]   I have to have these things.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:08.400]   And then we slowly, little by little bit, we covet and we go, next thing you know, you
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:12.760]   wake up 5, 10, 15 years later, you're not the same person you were before.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.200]   So it's not just about an event.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.120]   It's not just about just one thing.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:24.420]   It's just our life, our character begins to change because we've allowed coveting to creep
[00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:29.240]   into our hearts and the decisions that we make, where we go to live, what we pursue,
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:36.280]   what we value, what we're willing to compromise, all because we've allowed coveting to creep
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:37.280]   in.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.880]   Don't worry, I'm almost done.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:45.120]   We'll deal with this after the service.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.120]   Hebrews 13.6.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:51.200]   I feel like I'm in a disco.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:46:03.240]   Okay, Hebrews 13.6, it says, "So that we confidently say, emphatically say, 'The Lord is my helper.
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.720]   I will not be afraid.
[00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:08.960]   What will man do to me?'"
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:13.880]   That's our goal this morning, so that we can say confidently, we can emphatically say,
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:20.640]   "The Lord is my helper, not my bank account, not the politicians, not my husband, not my
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.120]   wife, not my children.
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:24.200]   The Lord is my helper.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.360]   I will not be afraid."
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:28.800]   I'm not going to let the fear of, "Well, if I do this, what if I can't get this?
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.680]   What if my children are not going to have this?"
[00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:35.280]   I'm not going to let the fear guide my decisions in what I do.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:41.040]   What could possibly man do when God has promised, "I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.120]   leave you."
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.120]   So let me conclude with this.
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:49.300]   In Philippians 4.12, Paul says, "I know how to get along with humble means, and I also
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:50.760]   know how to live in prosperity.
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:57.080]   In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of being content, of being filled,
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:00.240]   and going hungry, both having abundance and suffering in need.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.240]   I can do all things through Him who strengthens me."
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:06.480]   You notice here, Apostle Paul says, "I have learned it."
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:11.400]   He didn't just attend a class and somebody didn't just show him a verse and he said,
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.920]   "Oh, how did he learn it?
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:13.920]   By life."
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:18.720]   There are some periods in his life when rich people were giving him finances, and so he
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:22.320]   his ministry was fully paid for and he didn't have to worry.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.980]   And then there are periods when he didn't have to work his tail off to make tents to
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.840]   make ends meet.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:31.680]   He experienced hunger as an apostle, handpicked apostle of God.
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:35.160]   He experienced poverty and he experienced riches.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:36.360]   So it's not about being poor.
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:38.020]   It's not about being rich.
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:41.720]   So whether you have a lot, whether you have a little, I have learned the contentment is
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:44.860]   in Christ.
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:52.080]   So this morning, as we wrap up before the disco light goes off again, this is where
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.060]   the rubber meets the road.
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:58.960]   You know, last week we talked about honoring marriage and sexuality and all these things
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:03.000]   are practically entering and we're having all kinds of struggles.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.720]   We talk about persecution and the politicians and crazy things that they're doing in the
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:07.720]   educational system.
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:11.640]   All of these things, I think as Christians, we need to be aware.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.480]   We need to be aware, get involved.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.680]   We live in a free country.
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:16.240]   We can vote our values.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:21.200]   All of these things are freedoms that we have been given by the grace of God.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:27.160]   But what causes the greatest destruction in the church is this constant nibbling at the
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:35.800]   table of the world that allows the coveting into our hearts with no filter.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:42.200]   Knowing that the God of this age is planting seeds in our mind and in our heart and we
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:46.920]   give into it day after day after day after day.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:52.840]   So you don't see yourself slipping until years have gone by and you see where you've drifted
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:56.080]   and you realize, how did I get here?
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.720]   You didn't get here by a decision.
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:00.040]   You didn't get here because you jumped off a cliff.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:06.280]   You got there because it was day after day after day after day of allowing this covetous
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:10.160]   heart to reign in our hearts.
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:17.240]   So this morning as we pray before God, let's come before the Lord and honestly pray.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:18.240]   Search me and know me.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:21.360]   See if there's any hurtful way in me.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:31.200]   Have I allowed these coveting, not just material things, desire for praise, desire for comfort,
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:36.700]   for refuge, our hope, better place in life, along with the material things.
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:41.640]   Have I allowed these things to rule over my heart?
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:42.640]   Lord search me and know me.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:43.920]   See if there's any hurtful ways in me.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:49.720]   So as our worship team comes, let's take some time to pray and to really come before the
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:53.540]   Lord and allow the Word of God to judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart.
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:53.800]   Let's pray.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:50:03.600]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
