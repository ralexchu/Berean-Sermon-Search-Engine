[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   we can look to the cross as a full display of his love,
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.920]   that he would send his son Jesus to die on the cross
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.520]   so that we can be forgiven of our sins,
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.800]   so that we can receive true life.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.800]   So with that, let us sing this first song, "Amazing Love."
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.220]   (gentle music)

[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:36.380]   - Good morning, everybody.
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.300]   I wanna extend a warm welcome to you,
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.180]   and especially if you're visiting us for the first time.
[00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.100]   After the service is done, please stick around.
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.500]   We do have our welcome table
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.540]   right at the entrance of the parking lot.
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.700]   We love to visit with you
[00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.180]   and provide any information about the church.
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.020]   Additionally, at 12.45, when this service is done,
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.700]   for any of you who have questions about Christianity,
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.420]   would like to learn more,
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.020]   we have a special meeting, a Q&A session
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.580]   across the courtyard on the right entrance.
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.260]   You'll see a little Q&A entrance there.
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.940]   We're gonna be just providing some snacks,
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.980]   but also some resources, sharing a little bit,
[00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.500]   and also answering any questions
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.340]   that you may have in a formal sense.
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.820]   We have a small panel to answer,
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.220]   field some of the questions that you have.
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.300]   So we'd love to have you join us.
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.100]   For this morning, I wanna invite up Elder Phillip.
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.300]   He has some additional announcements as well.
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:33.580]   - Okay, good morning.
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.860]   I have a couple announcements.
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.540]   First of all, there's going to be
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:41.540]   a Season Jubilee Fellowship lunch
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.500]   for November 27th at 1 p.m.,
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.940]   and the cost is gonna be $10 per person.
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.020]   So this is for those who are 50 and over,
[00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.900]   and I know there are a handful of you,
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.220]   and especially if you're new to the church,
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.460]   you're checking out the church,
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.420]   come on, join us, we wanna have fellowship with you.
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.300]   The other is I call the event
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.000]   Season Jubilee Fellowship Lunch,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.060]   and Proverbs 22, one says,
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.840]   "A good name is to be more desired than great wealth."
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.140]   So the season for the name Season is over,
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.180]   so we're no longer gonna be calling it Season Fellowship,
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.740]   but rather Jubilee Fellowship.
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.580]   And why you ask the name change?
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.580]   In the Bible, the number seven is associated with the Sabbath
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.420]   and God created the world in six days,
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.120]   and on the seventh day, he rested.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.520]   But also in the Old Testament,
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.280]   there is a Sabbath rest for the land.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.260]   So every seventh year,
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.900]   there were to do no harvesting for the entire year,
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.660]   and there was rest.
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.660]   Well, there's also in Leviticus 25,
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:54.340]   on the seventh Sabbath of the year,
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.820]   so it's 49 years, and on the 50th year,
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.500]   it's called Jubilee,
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.540]   and I'm gonna read Leviticus 25, eight through 10,
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.220]   just follow along.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.300]   "You are also to count off seven Sabbath of years
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.120]   "for yourself, seven times seven years,
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.160]   "so that you have the time of seven Sabbath of years,
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.940]   "namely 49 years.
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.360]   "You shall thus consecrate the 50th year
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.980]   "and proclaim a release through the land
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.520]   "to all its inhabitants.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.740]   "It shall be a jubilee for you,
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.620]   "and each of you shall return his own property,
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.100]   "and each of you shall return to his family."
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.140]   So the year of Jubilee was a time of release,
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.700]   redemption, and restoration.
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.760]   For New Testament Christians,
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.060]   the year of Jubilee was also significant
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.980]   because it reflects what Jesus did for us on the cross.
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.700]   He released us from sin,
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.360]   he redeemed us from the penalty of sin,
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.580]   and he restored us back to a relationship with God.
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.920]   So we are changing the name to Jubilee Fellowship
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.940]   because the year of Jubilee, first of all, it's 50,
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.660]   so it's for those who are 50 and over,
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.660]   but besides that, why is the name Jubilee better than season?
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.780]   First, season focuses on the age.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.740]   It says we are old, all right?
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.740]   Jubilee focuses on the status.
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.740]   We have been saved by the blood of Christ,
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.860]   and he is our Jubilee.
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.020]   Season is what you do to food before you eat it.
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.220]   It is here today and gone tomorrow.
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.300]   Jubilee is what you proclaim in celebration
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.520]   throughout the land the day is celebrated.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.120]   You should not be ashamed to be seasoned,
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.740]   but embrace it, celebrate God's faithfulness.
[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.460]   Season looks back at how things used to be.
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.340]   Jubilee looks forward to the Jubilee
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.300]   that is coming in Christ.
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.140]   So there's more to it, there's a lot of symbolism,
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.380]   which I'd like to use as a vision
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.240]   for the Jubilee Fellowship.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.880]   So I invite you to come to the lunch.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.500]   There is a song, but I will post it on the Facebook,
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.340]   and hopefully you see it, but then that's it.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.180]   Thank you.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.020]   (audience applauding)
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.420]   - Okay, thank you Elder Phillip.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.980]   For the other announcements, please do check out the app
[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.540]   on the various sign-up link trees.
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.520]   At this time, we are gonna enter into time of our offering.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.460]   For those of you who have a physical check,
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.380]   there is a box there at the back, at the entrance.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.460]   Otherwise, you can give it on the online format.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.860]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.860]   Our God, we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.620]   We thank you, God, for your mercies.
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.620]   Lord, we thank you for the love that you give to us.
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.180]   And Lord, we wanna just regularly reflect upon
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.740]   just how privileged we are to know you,
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.380]   and to be able to come, to call you Abba Father,
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.020]   and to worship.
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.320]   As we enter into a time now, both of singing,
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.220]   giving offering, giving you our attention
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.740]   as we listen to the word, we pray, God,
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.260]   you be pleased in all these things,
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.740]   and help us to just continue to express our heart attitude,
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.280]   knowing, God, that everything we have
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.860]   comes from your gracious hand.
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.560]   We thank you, Lord, and offer this time to you
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.940]   in Christ's name, amen.
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.780]   (soft piano music)

[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:45.140]   - Okay, good morning again, everybody.
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.800]   As we enter into time of the word,
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.000]   let's go before God and pray together.
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.120]   Our Father, we want to always just continue
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.880]   to give you all recognition and honor and praise.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.920]   And as we say, Lord, it is our prayer, God,
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.560]   that as you are the creator,
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.600]   that everything that has breath,
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.260]   all of your creation are rendered to you,
[00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.600]   the worship that you are due.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.060]   And Father, at this time, we thank you, God,
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.460]   that you're the one giving.
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.900]   You're the one giving your truth and conviction.
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.040]   You're the one giving the ministry of your spirit.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.380]   And I pray that we would have receptive hearts,
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.220]   God, hearts that are sensitive and soft
[00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.320]   and broken before you, Lord, that we would truly learn.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.220]   We thank you, God, it's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:41.420]   I take this opportunity to tell you something
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:45.160]   I'm really happy about is that I was able to just finish
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.760]   yet another semester of my doctoral program.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.440]   So I was able to, oh, thank you.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.440]   That's great.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.600]   I didn't expect it, but thank you.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.880]   But also, you know, actually, I'm almost 100% sure
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.180]   that next year I'm gonna be able to graduate
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.580]   with a solid 4.0.
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:09.320]   And, oh, okay, okay, all right.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:14.220]   And some of you guys are probably sitting there
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.560]   because I know some of you in this room
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.900]   also have doctorates and you guys have medical degrees.
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.800]   But do you have this?
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.800]   This is a Draven image.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:28.400]   And this just looks exactly like me.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.980]   And I thought that this would completely solidify
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.480]   my place here at Berean by if I just nailed it
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.120]   to the pulpit just like that.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.220]   So once I finish this degree, you know,
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.460]   it's gonna be quite an accomplishment.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.360]   I would ask that all of you would start calling me
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.460]   Reverend Dr. Pastor Mark,
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.760]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.300]   which would be a really big eagle boost for me,
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.800]   so please do it, okay?
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.260]   And then once I actually finish,
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.500]   then that's the time when you have enough credentials
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.940]   to start writing books, and I've always wanted to write.
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.740]   So I have, actually, if you know me,
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.940]   I have tons of thoughts that aren't well articulated,
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.240]   but I put them into documents
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.020]   and they kind of build over time.
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.020]   I've got many books I wanna write.
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.780]   So once I become an author,
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:15.160]   you can call me Dr. Author Reverend Pastor Mark,
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.560]   and I'll be Rad Pastor.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.860]   (mumbling)
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.860]   But my qualm, actually, is not so much
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:22.700]   what you would call me.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.800]   I was trying to think about what
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.540]   I would ask Bea to call me, you know?
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.300]   'Cause once you attain to that level,
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.880]   I don't know, she calls me hun and yobo,
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.080]   but is that appropriate for my level?
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.720]   Okay, guys, okay, time out.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.220]   You know I'm joking, right?
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.320]   I'm joking about everything, okay?
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.220]   I'm not gonna be graduating with a 4.0,
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.060]   that's for sure.
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.520]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.960]   I'm not gonna be asking my wife
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.320]   to call me something special,
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.460]   and this was actually a gift.
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.160]   Thank you, congregation.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.360]   During Pastor's Appreciation Month,
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.960]   I didn't make this graven image of myself,
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.900]   but I actually don't know why they gave me this.
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.000]   I'm guessing it's like a stress tool.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.440]   You know, when I mess up, I just (growling)
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.040]   It'd be a great stress reliever.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.140]   I am joking, okay?
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.720]   I don't expect you to call me anything different.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.040]   As a matter of fact, just the fact
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.120]   that I get stuff like this,
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.520]   you guys give us leaders far more respect
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.280]   than we deserve, okay?
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.580]   But I want you to have this feeling inside your heart,
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.600]   which was, it was getting weird, wasn't it?
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.660]   Yeah, it was getting real weird
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.460]   when I was waving your applause on.
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.360]   You know, that's kind of strange,
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.060]   and as a matter of fact,
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.300]   if you think about it, highly inappropriate, right?
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.540]   I stand up here, just the fact
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.400]   that I'm standing up here as a pastor,
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.340]   that means I should have already wrestled through that,
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.640]   and then killed that stuff
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.980]   prior to coming up to the pulpit.
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.320]   And as a matter of fact,
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.680]   I want you to have certain words embedded into your mind
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.880]   as I enter through walking through some scriptures with you.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.900]   I want you to think, "Meh, Pastor Mark is vain."
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.320]   You don't have to say it out loud,
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.760]   but just have it in your mind.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.620]   "Meh, Pastor Mark is vain."
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:11.800]   Because to have that kind of arrogance
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.020]   where title matters and expect people,
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:18.140]   almost demanding that even the people closest to me
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.860]   give me some kind of honor,
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.640]   expecting that you, in some sense,
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:28.240]   acknowledge the accomplishments that I have attained,
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.700]   there's something grossly vain about that.
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.880]   And what's more, it's arrogant.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.440]   Let's use those words, it's narcissistic,
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.320]   it's sinfully arrogant,
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:43.320]   because arrogance, by definition, has this empty void.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.280]   What am I talking about?
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.600]   Arrogance means that in my perspective, I come up here.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.760]   I think I'm capable, I deserve, I have accomplished,
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.200]   and you should see me as such in that perspective,
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.440]   when in reality, I'm down here.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.700]   Spiritually, I'm compromised,
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.620]   I have fleshly ambitions that should have died,
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.840]   I am susceptible to the work of the devil,
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.120]   who will have a foothold in my life,
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.460]   and I have no authority to speak.
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.020]   But I come at you up here.
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.660]   That's all smoke and no barbecue, right?
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.620]   It's fake.
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:21.640]   And that gap, it's vain, it's empty.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.180]   There's a huge rift between what I am expecting
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:28.340]   and the reality of the state of affairs, okay?
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.740]   And the reason why I did this is because
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.480]   not a single one of you would disagree with me
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.320]   on what I'm saying.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.060]   Every single one of us would know
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.020]   that that kind of talk, attitude, and perspective
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:41.420]   is narcissistic vanity, correct?
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.720]   And I pray that more and more,
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.100]   all of that would be eradicated from my life.
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:51.580]   But confession, am I pure of that?
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.620]   We live currently in a generation
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.220]   of fantasy land narcissism.
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.780]   We live in a generation of, oh, I wish I could've,
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.900]   only if I would've, then I might've.
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.640]   And then we live in a generation
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.660]   where we have visions, daydreams, fantasies,
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.780]   but also we feed ourselves images
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.080]   of things that are narcissistic.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.500]   As a guy, any element of sports,
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.740]   where you have guys in the cage, MMA,
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.100]   they just beat somebody up and like,
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.920]   oh, I'm King Kong, I'm the best,
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.580]   no one could ever beat me, I'm the GOAT,
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.120]   greatest of all time, right?
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.080]   Meaning, in not only those elements of life,
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.220]   but probably in my own heart,
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.600]   even though I know it's narcissism,
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.360]   I still love it.
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.260]   That's my guy, yeah, that's right.
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.520]   Young guys dreaming about taking a ball
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.900]   and dunking it on somebody's head,
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.480]   having fantasies of the glory,
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.520]   standing on the stands and throwing dust in the air
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.600]   and saying, yeah, this is our year, we're the best,
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.760]   no one can defeat us.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.620]   So why is it okay if we put it on the screen?
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:08.960]   Why is it okay, rappers, you put it into lyrical form,
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.920]   you know, I'm not gonna do it.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.640]   But you put it into lyrical form
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.780]   and now you're the best, you're the greatest rapper
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.600]   that ever will be and it's all okay,
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.680]   and not only is it okay, but it inspires us, weird.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.900]   And I'm willing to bet that we're all very similar,
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.760]   that we have fantasies of greater glory,
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.580]   greater attention, greater affection
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.840]   from the people around us, greater accolades,
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.720]   greater success and hope even for more.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:38.680]   We are souls that are intentioned like that
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.540]   and Jesus knew it, our Lord knew it.
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:45.300]   So he gave us many, many commands, many, many warnings,
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.400]   saying there's going to be an ambition and desire in you
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.480]   to secure more and more, to treasure this world,
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.980]   to have a false hope into the things that are material.
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.440]   And he gives us this warning to say no,
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:04.740]   those things are fleeting, vain and empty, amen?
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:08.660]   Now, the problem though is we know this mentally,
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.500]   but subtly we allow for this desire
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.440]   to grow and develop in our hearts.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.840]   And so I want to move forward to give you
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.760]   a couple arguments to tell you that none of the things
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.680]   that you are pursuing currently,
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.360]   none of the ambitions in your heart,
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:29.360]   none of the goals that you have established for yourself,
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.640]   that none of it is worth it.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.880]   Scripture actually tells us actually
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.360]   that there is this vanity,
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.300]   meaning that it's empty all over the place.
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:42.480]   Everything under the sun is subject to this kind of futility.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.680]   So first, I want to give you a list of all the things
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.480]   that scripture describes as vain
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.360]   and is not limited to education.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.640]   But I want to highlight these things.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.680]   I'm not going to read every single one of them,
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.760]   but clearly we live in a generation
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.600]   where we have given much hope to education.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:03.520]   We believe in it, and in some sense, rightly so.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.920]   Because through education with greater knowledge
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:10.200]   becomes discernment, becomes decision-making possibilities
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.780]   that you will make better financial securities for yourself
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.640]   and that's why people will risk it
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:21.160]   to pay 20, $30,000 a year to go to college.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.560]   Yes, that's a huge risk.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.900]   It is not uncommon these days
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.880]   to have people come out of college
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:32.880]   with 80, 90, $100,000 in debt, okay?
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.480]   What's more, we have this vision of our achievements
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.880]   and efforts wanting to leave a legacy.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.180]   What's more, we have visions
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.220]   of the kind of relationships that we'll have.
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.760]   The secular world and their advice,
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.880]   they're going to get really explicit.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.100]   Get rid of all the negative influences in your life,
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.300]   even if it's your family, get rid of them.
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.520]   Surround for yourself people who will support you,
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.200]   believe in you, and trust you.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:59.740]   They believe you can do what you set yourself out to do.
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.400]   The world will be explicit about it.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.160]   Has it infiltrated the church?
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.480]   Sure.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.640]   Unfortunately, sad state of affairs is
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.760]   it's a great thing we have many churches.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.040]   It's a great thing that we have churches
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.400]   of different size, right?
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.260]   Different kind of dynamics, et cetera,
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.120]   but now based upon if there's no community for me,
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.800]   I can just go to the next church and choose.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.280]   That's kind of an unfortunate state of affairs.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.720]   We are a generation of people
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.480]   who have great human accumulation.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.040]   Our generation, if you look at the media,
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.920]   social media, whatever it may be,
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.920]   we have people collecting anything,
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:42.760]   shoes, memorabilia from movies to even people.
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:48.960]   We live in quite a wild and dangerous generation.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.000]   Now, I said I'm gonna make an argument in case to you
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.740]   because of the fact that we are so prone
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.760]   to still nevertheless believe in it,
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.600]   I wanna show you some strange statistics.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.640]   And here they are.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.760]   I know we have a lot of college students in the room.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.520]   I'm not just trying to pick on you,
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.760]   but our college students are sad, okay?
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:11.080]   What I mean by that isn't that, oh, you're not performing,
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.560]   or that you're doing X, Y, and Z.
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.660]   What I mean is, statistically speaking,
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:19.260]   strangely speaking, let's say we took a sample of this room.
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.660]   There are people in their 60s, 50s, 40s, 30s.
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:26.700]   The saddest group are the people between 18 and 22.
[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:27.540]   Why?
[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:31.060]   Because statistically, 41% of college students
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.160]   between the ages of 18 and 22 are depressed.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:37.260]   This study that I looked up from,
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.300]   the group is called Statista, I believe, .com.
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.460]   It's not some conservative group.
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:42.300]   It's not a Christian group.
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.940]   They just do surveys.
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:48.940]   They had a study done with over 100,000 participants.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:52.700]   That is a large enough sample of college students, okay?
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.780]   And within this, they said that,
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:56.820]   I know the words are small there, I apologize for that,
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.380]   but 19% of individuals have moderate depression.
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.580]   Now, moderate depression, there's different degrees,
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.180]   but that means they had either sleeplessness,
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:08.020]   anxiety attacks, which meant their heart was beating fast,
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.060]   they had either breath associations, that stuff,
[00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.700]   or they were too afraid to go to class, something like that.
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.340]   And then another 22% had severe depression,
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:17.860]   which means there was function loss.
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.560]   They couldn't function in the classroom.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:20.940]   What's more, severe depression
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.820]   typically includes suicidal ideation.
[00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:27.680]   That blew my mind when I did the research.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.160]   What?
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.100]   College students, in many ways,
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.200]   are in the epitome of hopefulness.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.180]   You're in your prime, looking forward
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:38.660]   to all that is ahead of you,
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.380]   and you've bought into the system that said
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.740]   your education is now going to put you
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:45.460]   into the top one third of America.
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:48.200]   You have now the prowess to make your decisions
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.300]   so that you will be financially secure,
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.080]   and you're in a unique environment
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.020]   that's tailor-made for you,
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.540]   where everybody is your age, learning the same thing,
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:57.780]   going through the same routine,
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:01.180]   and you, in your time now, you have more free time
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.540]   than you'll ever have in the rest of your life.
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:06.340]   But then you're hopeless.
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.100]   If this world tries to sell me on college,
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.760]   I'm gonna say, "Look at this."
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.740]   Right?
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.860]   The fruits tell the tale of the story
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.160]   is very disappointing.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.480]   And what we know to be true,
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.980]   that things in the world, these promises of the world,
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.900]   are actually very susceptible,
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.460]   full of holes, and in many ways, vain.
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.200]   Now, that's just the statistics,
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:34.060]   but I want you to think about this,
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.200]   just even in your own anecdotes.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.620]   I'm pretty sure you have your own life stories,
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.620]   because you have probably tried.
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:43.660]   You have probably tried to pursue,
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:45.300]   when you're young, a lot of times, it's your friends,
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.760]   so you try to pursue so hard
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.040]   to hold on to those relationships,
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.980]   to build strong community,
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:52.400]   and then somebody disappoints you
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.860]   because they pick another group.
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.980]   Somebody disappoints you because they leave your life.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.540]   Somebody disappoints you because they're the ones
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:00.260]   who end up hurting you, and then your world shatters.
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.460]   Some of you have already invested yourself
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.380]   into these other vices
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.420]   of wanting to have success at all costs,
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.180]   so you completely ruined your health.
[00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:11.020]   You even took drugs to get there.
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.740]   You did everything in your power,
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:17.500]   and you have your own stories to tell younger people,
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.340]   this world is full of vanity.
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:22.100]   You know, I was talking to my neighbor,
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:23.800]   and she was an Olympian.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.300]   From starting at a young age,
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.320]   she trained hard for this one purpose,
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.460]   to go to the Olympics, and she made it.
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:32.160]   She was at the Olympic Village, and she medaled, too.
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.140]   And I talked to her about this topic
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:37.900]   because I preached a sermon about bookleiclesiastes
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.260]   about a year ago, and I said,
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:42.500]   "What are your thoughts about this idea of emptiness?"
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.640]   And she said, "It's crazy because in one sense,
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.540]   "when you're at the Olympics,
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:51.540]   "you are literally at the top of your game
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.720]   "and of everybody else's.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:57.380]   "You can say these people are the best in the world.
[00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:00.820]   "Not at your school, not at your university,
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.920]   "not in your city, not in your country,
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.900]   "but the world."
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.260]   Can you imagine that?
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.900]   The weight of that?
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.860]   You would think then you would just be bursting with joy,
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.340]   pride, and a sense of achievement, which is true.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.180]   Short-lived.
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:15.340]   She said, "You get there,
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.880]   "you have sponsors you have to deal with.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.120]   "They want certain things out of you,
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.340]   "and sometimes you don't know if you wanna give it.
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.700]   "You have to get other people to vouch for you.
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.700]   "You're constantly afraid the next younger person
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:25.660]   "is gonna take your place.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.240]   "You're constantly afraid you're gonna break something
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.220]   "in your body.
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.360]   "The people who are there, they're not satisfied.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.000]   "You have people who are married go into there,
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.160]   "they get into the Olympic Village,
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.060]   "and then they start flirting with everybody else.
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.360]   "Some people have a wife in every country they visit.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.880]   "It's a madhouse in there.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.000]   "There's so many things wrong in that world,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.220]   "it feels empty."
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.460]   And I said, "Wow.
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.600]   "Thank you for telling me.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.120]   "But I'm pretty sure you don't have to be at that level
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.100]   "to have stories."
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.200]   Amen?
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.860]   You have your own.
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.880]   How disappointing this world can be.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.140]   Now, this first point, I wanna continue on
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:02.180]   by sharing with you that it's not only
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.100]   about these statistics.
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.780]   This is a statistic of young people
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:08.260]   between the age of 10 and 24
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.580]   who have committed suicide over the years.
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.780]   Why is it that if we are getting,
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.860]   the human race is getting better by technology,
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:19.180]   the human race is getting better by cooperative effort,
[00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:22.780]   getting better by whatever it is that we think,
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.700]   whether it's financial, environmental,
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.140]   or systems and government,
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.780]   but the suicide rate amongst the young people
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:29.940]   are so horrific.
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.440]   This is outdated because 2017,
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.740]   in 2020, the people who called into a hotline for help
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:38.560]   because they were trying to attempt suicide
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.360]   was at 1.2 million people.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.840]   Yeah, it's shocking.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:48.380]   Well, many years ago, the scripture already knew
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:53.380]   how we would behave when we placed our hopes on this world.
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:56.160]   I wanna give you a change of argument now
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.400]   from the scriptures.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:01.160]   King Solomon was a wise king, so wise.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.160]   He was an actual human being,
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.280]   but he was gifted with wisdom by God.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.720]   He was a wise individual among wise men,
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.420]   and he had a wise think tank,
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.080]   making him an incredibly wise person,
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.920]   and he had this to say.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.160]   He said, "The word of the preacher,
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.520]   "the son of David, king of Jerusalem,
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.660]   "vanity of vanities," says the preacher,
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.200]   "vanity of vanities, all is vanity."
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.660]   All is vanity.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.560]   And what he was trying to say was
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.640]   he observed with all of his wisdom,
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.560]   he observed not only with his wisdom,
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.720]   but with his experience,
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.200]   all that the world had to offer,
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:40.200]   and he concluded there is something royally wrong.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.600]   I want you to just listen to this portion of the text,
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.480]   and it says in Ecclesiastes chapter two,
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.480]   this is Ecclesiastes chapter two,
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.360]   King Solomon speaking his wisdom.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.720]   He said, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure."
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.760]   He's speaking to himself.
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.880]   He has said the world is filled with vanities,
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:58.360]   and then he said, "By experience,
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.440]   "I'm gonna test that principle."
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.840]   And so he says, "So enjoy yourself,
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.720]   "and behold, it was futility."
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:10.040]   He said, "I said of laughter, entertainment and joy,
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.560]   "this is madness, and I said of pleasure,
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.200]   "what does it accomplish?
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:18.520]   "I explored with my mind how to stimulate my body with wine."
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.180]   Okay, people nowadays try that.
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:21.940]   "While my mind was guiding me wisely
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:23.840]   "in how to take hold of folly,
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.640]   "until I could see what good is there
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.640]   "for the sons of men to do under the sun
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:29.760]   "the few years of his life.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.520]   "I enlarged my works, I built houses for myself,
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.000]   "I planted vineyards for myself,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.880]   "and all that my eyes desired,
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.820]   "I didn't refuse any of them.
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.960]   "I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure,
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.720]   "for my heart was pleased because all my labor,
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.360]   "and this was my reward for all my labor.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.080]   "Thus I considered all the activities
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.400]   "which my hands had done,
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.680]   "and the labor which I exerted,
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.520]   "and behold, all was vanity,
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.120]   "and striving after wind,
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:00.160]   "there was no prophet under the sun."
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.400]   There is no prophet under the sun, he says.
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.400]   So those are the words of King Solomon,
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:10.280]   who had the power to actually try
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.780]   all of his concepts and theories.
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.840]   You see, we have a lot of people who write in our day.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.320]   We have a lot of authors.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.720]   We have a lot of analysts and critics.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:22.400]   They have theories and concepts that they wanna try,
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.140]   and they say, "Oh, it would be only good for our nation.
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:26.900]   "It would be good for our people.
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.880]   "It would be good for our generation."
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.600]   Yada, yada, yada, but they never had the power
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.440]   to do all that stuff.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:36.360]   King Solomon had all the authority to command it to happen.
[00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.580]   What's more, he had all the resources
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:40.200]   to experience it for himself,
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.920]   and he's telling you, "I tried it."
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.360]   Don't you sit there telling yourself,
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.660]   "No, no, no, let me just taste and see.
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.160]   "I need to see it for yourself."
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.000]   Listen to this man.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.760]   He tried to give himself to women.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.840]   He had over, this is a disgusting sin,
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:00.040]   but he had over 700 wives and 300 concubine.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.760]   He collected horses and chariots.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.600]   He had over 12,000 horses, it says in 1 Kings.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.640]   He had over 1,500 chariots.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.080]   He had wise men around him.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:11.800]   He had every single luxury and pleasure possible.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.400]   All the stuff we flip through on YouTube,
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.100]   on Instagram, and the social media
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.540]   about people with their grandeur,
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.640]   this guy was a king,
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:27.060]   and he's trying to convince us it was so empty.
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.980]   And this reminded me of a personal note,
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:31.140]   not necessarily about me,
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:34.300]   but right now I try to visit my mom every two weeks.
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.180]   Love her to death.
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.220]   She's trying to be a godly woman,
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:40.700]   but she also has the reality of life hitting her.
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.300]   She's in her late 70s now,
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:45.840]   and honestly speaking, she's sad.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.280]   And then when I show up, she says this weird,
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.120]   and cryptic, but also hurtful thing to me
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.840]   that makes me laugh, but also be like,
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.880]   hey, you know what she says to me?
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.760]   She goes, I wish I had daughters.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.920]   It's just me and my older brother,
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.520]   and she's straight up like, I just wish I had,
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.480]   and I'm like, what?
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.440]   And I didn't know how to react to that.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.360]   I was like, okay.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.440]   And then I realized what she was saying,
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.680]   'cause I was asking, why would you say
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.760]   something like that, you know?
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:15.840]   And it's because as men, we don't think about her enough.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.680]   So we visit like once a month,
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.040]   we call her periodically, and she said this to me.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.120]   She said, one of my fears, Mark,
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.200]   is that I'm straight up gonna die in my room
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.800]   and be on the floor for days before somebody even notices.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.480]   And you're not gonna know 'cause you come around
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.520]   once a month, and I just went, oh my God.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.360]   Turn around, shed a tear.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.860]   I didn't even know what to say, so I just said,
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.440]   don't say that.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.040]   What am I supposed to say to that?
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:47.040]   The reality of life is hitting her.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.780]   But she was an ambitious woman.
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.200]   She went through suffering.
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:51.720]   She went through the Korean War,
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.600]   lost her father at age four.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.920]   She risked everything to come to the States.
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.200]   She didn't know the language.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.840]   She worked every single day.
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.880]   My mom and dad worked through Thanksgiving,
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.560]   Christmas, and New Year's every year for 20 years.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.760]   Never took a break.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.860]   And then now, at the end of her life,
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.580]   she's just saying to me,
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:14.480]   I don't know if that was all worth it.
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:19.540]   She's saying to me, I don't know if that's all worth it.
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.180]   Those are some real words.
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:24.180]   And she's kind of looking at me for a solution,
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:27.960]   but I told her, I have my duties as a son.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.140]   I have my duties as one who loves you,
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:34.580]   but I'm not your hope either, remember?
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.180]   I'm not your solution.
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:41.100]   Don't bank on me because I'm full of vanity too.
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.760]   Do you remember what I asked you to remember?
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:48.780]   Dang, Mark Lim is vain.
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:50.920]   There's an emptiness in what I can provide.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:54.420]   And that's why I wanted to go at length with you
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:56.520]   to just hit this point that the scripture
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:59.640]   over and over again is trying to convince you.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.600]   It's not just one thing, it's everything.
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:02.640]   It's not just one person.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:07.480]   It's not just those guys there who are mean, evil people.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:11.120]   Anybody and everybody under the sun can be vain,
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.040]   including me.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:16.360]   And there is an emptiness of value and meaning.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.080]   What's the meaning of this all?
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.760]   King Solomon, he basically said,
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.040]   I'm gonna collect for myself all of the righteous people.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:28.200]   I'm gonna eradicate all the wicked politicians.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.040]   And he said that.
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.600]   He said, I'm gonna remove all the corrupt individuals
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:32.440]   and knock them out.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.320]   You know, he said next day,
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.120]   another corrupt man took his place.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.920]   What was the point of all that?
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.040]   There is an empty purpose.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.640]   He says, I've gathered all his money
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.920]   and then I gave it to my wicked son who blew it all.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.520]   What was the point of all that?
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:47.960]   There's such a fleeting, short-lived life.
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.640]   And he's the one who was saying,
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.900]   you die and no one truly remembers you.
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:56.640]   You talk about leaving a long legacy, okay?
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.600]   People will forget the next day.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.000]   There is an absurdity to reality.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.560]   Why is it that the wicked people prosper
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:07.080]   and they're all filthy rich
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.080]   and then the good guys, the humble guys,
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.160]   the sacrificial guys are just suffering?
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.000]   What gives?
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.400]   And I think right now in our day,
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.800]   that's like part of the mantra, right?
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.600]   There's something wrong with this world.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.720]   People who are evil are in power.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.400]   The oppressors are succeeding.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:27.360]   And we the little guys, it's a short on the stick.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.520]   Everything is backwards.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.020]   Pow, and you slam the table.
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:34.160]   That is the sentiment of our day.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.960]   There isn't justice all around us.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:38.240]   It's true, there is injustice all around us.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:42.520]   And we think about that and we demand,
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.120]   demand a righteous judge.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.960]   We demand somebody who would come
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.480]   and make right of all of that.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:53.280]   But right now I wanna take a brief moment to pause.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.760]   Of course, what I'm saying to you is not new.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.460]   Every single one of you would expect
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:01.680]   that the church would continue to push
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:05.440]   a kind of purity from the world, yes?
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.280]   What I'm saying now, you would have already expected.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.160]   Don't love the world, the world is evil.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.040]   What I'm saying to you is the world is evil
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.820]   on multiple levels.
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.420]   It is wrought with inconsistency.
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.160]   We put false hope in it because it's completely empty.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:19.760]   And the more that you bank on it,
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.960]   the more vain you become, okay?
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:27.680]   But my point isn't don't touch, don't taste, don't have.
[00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.560]   Because if I, let's say I was your dad, okay?
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.820]   I would want you to have a good job.
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:36.180]   I would want you to meet someone nice.
[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:37.540]   I would want you to have a community
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:39.380]   and I would want you to be successful.
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:41.660]   Why would I not want that for you?
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.220]   What's my point?
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.140]   That my point is not don't have.
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:51.580]   My point is not run away, go to the mountains.
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:52.880]   Because people have tried that
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.560]   and even human religion is vain.
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:59.380]   There are people who are monks in temples who are vain.
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:01.900]   You just not having means you just don't have,
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:03.220]   but it doesn't mean you have purpose,
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.140]   doesn't mean you have meaning,
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.300]   doesn't mean you have value.
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.060]   It just means you don't have.
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:11.500]   My point isn't to make you escape this world
[00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.140]   because you can't come out of it.
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.740]   What is the point then?
[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:18.380]   King Solomon point is the point that
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:21.020]   the scripture is trying to drive to us.
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:24.980]   Get your eyes off the world and get your eyes on God
[00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:28.520]   because a life without God is completely meaningless.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.700]   But a life that is centered upon God,
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:32.140]   where we are in his presence,
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:34.340]   where he knows us and we know him,
[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:36.300]   we are living according to his will,
[00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.020]   we feel his spirit, we understand him,
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.420]   and we're going towards the direction of God,
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.180]   that is life, amen?
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:48.300]   And that's the constant struggle
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:50.380]   for every Christian individual.
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:53.640]   Living a life of physical sight in this world
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.120]   or living a life of faith.
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:58.500]   And so my first point was to show you
[00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:02.660]   that what we're most susceptible to
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:05.460]   is this regular, I guess you can even say
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:09.580]   sinister, subtle desire to still wish and hope
[00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:12.220]   that we could have some success in this life.
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.900]   The scripture is saying, you know what?
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:17.060]   Even some of that is not worth it.
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:21.220]   The only thing that is truly worth it is God almighty.
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.680]   The only true thing that is worth your energy,
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.500]   time, sacrifice, endeavor, investment,
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.620]   and every synonym you can possibly use
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:34.300]   is God almighty.
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:37.140]   And I wanna show you that earlier I described
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:40.180]   these various ways in which things in life can be vain
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:41.040]   and guess what?
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.380]   There's more.
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.340]   You know that there's a lot more.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:45.980]   Things are vain because things don't work.
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.340]   Things are vain because they're ineffective.
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:49.180]   Things are vain because it's just fluff.
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:51.980]   There's so many different ways that things can be vain.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:56.880]   But in everything that is wrong with this world,
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.280]   God is the solution.
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:04.120]   I wanna show you this counter,
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.240]   kinda antithetical look at God.
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:13.200]   God is the creator and master and Lord of the universe.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:17.460]   You see, we have this strange innate desire
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.940]   to elevate and give this adoration
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:21.380]   to things that are impressive.
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:24.000]   So earlier I talked about sports fighters
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.360]   and basketball players.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:26.800]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.200]   Why is it that we say things like,
[00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.760]   man, that guy's the man?
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:33.040]   Because he can throw a punch,
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.560]   but he's a corrupt individual.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.120]   He's a morally corrupt individual.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:41.600]   Well, this guy can dunk a ball, wow.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:45.040]   Let's hear what he has to say about all of life.
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.760]   Why is he a role model?
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:49.560]   What in the world is that?
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.880]   Well, because we found value
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:55.060]   in the kind of skill, power, and ability
[00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.880]   God Almighty can create out of nothing.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:02.160]   God Almighty can stay the world.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:05.420]   God Almighty can give life, sustain life, and take life.
[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:07.320]   You wanna talk about power?
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:11.440]   God Almighty is the most valuable thing.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.180]   He sustains everything.
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:18.860]   And he's worthy of all attention, glory, and honor.
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:21.320]   What's more, God is so purposeful.
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:24.380]   Scripture says that he is so intentional with you.
[00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:28.220]   Whatever step you take, he knows it.
[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.800]   In terms of his intentionality
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.580]   to have a relationship with you, he's thought of it.
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:34.300]   It was in his heart and in his mind.
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:36.900]   He willed it from before the foundation of the world.
[00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.220]   He's gonna execute it,
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:41.700]   and he is on target all the time, never misses.
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.380]   That's wild.
[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:48.860]   God, he's not temporary and fleeting
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:51.100]   like so many things in life.
[00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:54.140]   I mean, I kind of dogged on college degrees
[00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:56.100]   and stuff like that, but I've heard so many people
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.700]   look at their diploma and be like,
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:02.140]   that was one expensive piece of paper, right?
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:05.100]   Like, what value did it really hold for me?
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.180]   What did it really do for me?
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:09.300]   What's more, for those of you guys who are a bit older,
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:12.500]   those four years of college life went by like this.
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.140]   Half of it you don't even remember.
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:16.500]   So fleeting, doesn't last.
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:19.780]   God is eternal.
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:21.620]   He doesn't expire.
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:23.280]   There is no change in him.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.900]   And shall I go on?
[00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:27.100]   What I'm trying to say to you is,
[00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:29.760]   truly, truly, all the things that are vain,
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:32.840]   all of their solutions are found in God alone.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.100]   And so I want you to think about that
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:39.940]   because the main thing I want us to realize
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:43.420]   is I'm trying to say, hey, say, be able to say
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.580]   that it's not a matter about having
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:46.980]   or not having in this life.
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:48.540]   As a matter of fact, you gotta be willing
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:50.380]   to come above that and say, forsake the world.
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:51.440]   I don't need it.
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:55.020]   So what I really wanna have is God.
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:58.660]   And what I wanna share with you is that God
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:01.420]   really wants to have you.
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:05.140]   One of the grand and glorious things about God
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:07.740]   is that he is a God who is in pursuit of people,
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.280]   his creation.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.780]   I want you to think about this.
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:13.900]   All of these truths that I just described to you now,
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:15.820]   especially if you're joining us today
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:17.140]   and you are not a Christian
[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.740]   and you've been thinking about these things,
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:20.740]   where am I getting all these ideas from?
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:24.700]   How am I able to say God is eternal,
[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:25.740]   God is this and that?
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:26.780]   Do you know why?
[00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.740]   It's because God intentionally revealed himself.
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:33.160]   And that is an act of love.
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:35.340]   That is an act of care for you
[00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:40.340]   because only a person who has love to give in their heart
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:43.420]   would give of themselves.
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:44.860]   Why don't you try?
[00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:47.620]   You try going to somebody who has clout,
[00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:50.820]   influence, prestige, and money, and power.
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.860]   Go to Bill Gates and say, hey,
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:56.020]   can you share with me about your next plans?
[00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.140]   Would you be willing to share with me about your thoughts?
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:00.840]   How did you think about your success?
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:03.300]   You go and ask him to share with you his life?
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:07.180]   You go and ask him to share with you his house?
[00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.020]   Share with you his inheritance?
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:11.060]   Share with you his money?
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:12.520]   That would be wild and crazy.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:18.260]   God Almighty is a God who is a freely revealing
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:21.020]   and giving God, not just of stuff.
[00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:23.380]   If any Christian has taught you this weird gospel
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:24.960]   that says when you believe in God,
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:25.840]   you're gonna be a Christian
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.020]   and he's gonna straighten you out
[00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:28.900]   so that you can really succeed in life,
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:30.940]   then you're gonna really be able to focus and study.
[00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:32.900]   And then you're gonna do a really good job as a husband
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.180]   and you're gonna really succeed and have more stuff,
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:38.140]   more cars, more success, lives.
[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:42.560]   God wants to give of himself to you.
[00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:46.440]   That's why Christians long to come here.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:50.620]   We're going to experience, if any believer will tell you,
[00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:53.560]   no, no, no, the world is still silly.
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:54.700]   It's still folly.
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:57.900]   As a Christian, I walk through suffering, hardship,
[00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:01.120]   and weird kind of unfruitfulness all throughout my life.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:05.140]   But what I have is God.
[00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:07.700]   And what I get to do is love him.
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:09.660]   So what's the problem here?
[00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:12.580]   Why can't anybody just come and have this great God
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:13.900]   who's revealing himself?
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:17.860]   Because remember that idea of Mark Lim is vain?
[00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:21.820]   Vanity is not out there in the others,
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:25.060]   in the government, in the world systems at be
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:26.480]   and the powers at large.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.460]   It is actually there.
[00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:28.740]   Vanity is everywhere.
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:32.540]   But that vain individual is here.
[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:36.760]   What I started with as an illustration,
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:39.180]   those are realities that people actually want
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:41.280]   in their lives.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.400]   And this is what the scripture says to us.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.220]   We're not only vain like that,
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:47.820]   we're corrupt in so many different ways.
[00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:50.980]   The sad state of affairs and the reality of spirituality
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:53.820]   is that we have a hard time coming to God
[00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:56.300]   because of the brokenness and sinfulness
[00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.940]   bound in the heart of man.
[00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:01.620]   Take a look and listen to this.
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:06.080]   What then, are we any better than they?
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:07.480]   Not at all.
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:09.700]   For we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:10.980]   are all under sin.
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:14.820]   As it is written, there is none righteous, not even one.
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:16.640]   There is none who understands.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:18.440]   There is none who seeks for God.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:21.460]   All have turned aside together, they have become useless.
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:24.820]   There is none who does good, there is not even one.
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:26.420]   Their throat is an open grave,
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:29.340]   with their tongues they keep deceiving.
[00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:31.140]   Poison of ash is under their lips,
[00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:33.500]   whose mouth is full of cursing bitterness.
[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:35.700]   Their feet are swift to shed blood.
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:38.260]   Destruction and misery are in their paths
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:40.820]   and the path of peace they have not known.
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:45.060]   There is no fear of God before their eyes.
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.500]   What am I trying to say?
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:50.820]   I am not trying to say that you, if you're not a Christian,
[00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:54.060]   are the most wicked and vile and vain person ever
[00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:56.420]   that walked the face of the earth, no.
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:59.340]   I am not trying to say that you are somehow as evil
[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:00.740]   as evil could be.
[00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:04.380]   What I am trying to say is that already
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:07.020]   that we have been stained with sin
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:10.320]   and there is already a broken vanity in our hearts
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:13.460]   and in our minds and I know you feel it.
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:16.340]   My greatest frustration, I made a joke,
[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:18.300]   I brought this up for a purpose.
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.980]   There are so many moments when I make a muck of my life
[00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:24.100]   because of my decision and lack of self-control.
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:27.060]   And I wanna shake myself almost, why did you do that?
[00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:31.840]   I want you to think about this weird, weird thought.
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:35.120]   In the last 10 years, who has been the most hurtful
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:37.940]   to my loving, treasured, beloved wife
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:39.440]   who I see as my dream girl?
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:42.140]   It's me.
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:47.840]   I have vowed to be her protector, provider, and leader.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:50.500]   Guess who has caused her the greatest amount of pain
[00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:54.540]   because of my lack of self-control, my own selfishness,
[00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:58.600]   weird expectations, and inconsiderate behavior?
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:55:59.820]   (claps)
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:00.660]   It's me.
[00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:05.740]   Vanity is not out there, it's right here.
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:07.460]   And it comes out when I'm pressured.
[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:09.020]   It comes out when I'm frustrated.
[00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:10.620]   It comes out when I'm stressed.
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:13.980]   And what the scripture says is that kind of vanity
[00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:16.420]   is what's keeping us from God,
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:18.300]   from enjoying a relationship with the Lord
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:22.620]   because our own wrongdoings have caused a separation
[00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:24.680]   between you and your God and your sins
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:29.060]   have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear.
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:33.620]   I wanna convince you, the current state of affairs
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:37.740]   in your spirituality is not something that can be fixed.
[00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:40.140]   Some of you aren't in here because you already know
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:43.500]   that just trying to live life with your grit is not enough.
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.800]   And I use my relationship with my wife quite a bit
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.980]   because it is an appropriate example.
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:50.580]   There was a moment early on in my marriage,
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:52.540]   I've been married for 15 years,
[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:54.840]   when I had fought so deeply with my wife.
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:57.920]   I love her to death and weird, I was fighting with her
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:00.340]   and my heart went hard and cold and I said,
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:01.320]   "You know what?
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.780]   "I'm tired of talking to you today."
[00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:04.980]   And so we stopped the argument,
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:06.120]   we stopped talking to each other
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:08.880]   and that lasted for two weeks.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.240]   I didn't talk to her at home except,
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.280]   "Did you eat?
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:13.120]   "Did you take care of what you need to take care of?
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:14.040]   "Let's go to sleep."
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:17.880]   And that's all I said and the house was ice.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:21.240]   It was like Antarctica, there was nothing going on,
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:24.140]   there was no life going on in that home.
[00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:27.880]   I gotta tell you something, everything felt wrong.
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:29.780]   I was at work trying to type up an email,
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.480]   my mind would just drift.
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:33.820]   I'd go out and try to play, I didn't want to.
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:34.660]   Why?
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:38.740]   The thing that was supposed to be a loving relationship
[00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:42.020]   that I committed to with my wife was off.
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:44.820]   And when your relationship with God, therefore, is off,
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:47.220]   nothing will feel right.
[00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:49.860]   When your relationship with your maker and your creator,
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:51.940]   whom God is now pursuing you,
[00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:53.660]   I have been giving you now revelation
[00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:55.180]   that God is coming to pursue you
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:57.380]   because he wants a relationship with you
[00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:59.460]   just as a father would with his son.
[00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:02.780]   And if that relationship was off, you can't do anything.
[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:05.780]   Your conscience is not clear, your bearings are not right.
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:07.780]   You don't even have the ability to address
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:11.060]   and try to assess what is even going on right now.
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:16.500]   And our desire is not to confiscate
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:17.980]   your little joys you have in life,
[00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:22.260]   our desire is to say I want you to have the greatest thing,
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:24.700]   a loving relationship with God.
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:25.660]   Do you want that?
[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:32.460]   Do you want to have that kind of relationship
[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:36.900]   and interaction with God, the one who is truly valuable,
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:39.780]   the one who will truly last,
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:43.820]   one who promises you all of his resources?
[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:46.700]   And he's proven it by giving his son.
[00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:50.100]   He's proven it by giving himself.
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:53.660]   And if your answer is yes, I want to tell you
[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:55.300]   the way is clear, the way is simple,
[00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:56.940]   and the way it can be today.
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:59:00.500]   Some people will tell you, you know what you got to do,
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:02.920]   you got to buy into our program, join our church,
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:05.500]   attend this class, have years of training,
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.020]   and da-da-da-da-da, the answer is no.
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:10.740]   If we're having a relationship with God,
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:13.420]   you can have a relationship today.
[00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:15.700]   Some people will tell you to go on this spiritual journey,
[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:17.620]   some people will tell you to just empty yourself
[00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:19.180]   and free your mind.
[00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:20.860]   No.
[00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:25.100]   We want you to fill your mind with the love of God.
[00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:28.260]   The way is clear and God is showing you his loving way,
[00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:30.900]   and it begins by this passage where scripture says
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:34.380]   that God has prepared a way, he has prepared to forgive you,
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:37.140]   he has prepared to love you, and he has prepared
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:40.180]   that your relationship can be reconciled with him.
[00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:44.260]   And that comes from Romans chapter five, verse eight.
[00:59:44.260 --> 00:59:47.420]   And it says, "God demonstrates his own love towards us
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:49.700]   in that while we were yet sinners,"
[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:51.460]   not while we were fixing ourselves,
[00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:53.780]   not while we were working hard,
[00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:56.300]   not while you're getting it right,
[00:59:56.300 --> 01:00:00.660]   but while you were yet sinners, "Christ died for us.
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:03.780]   Much more than having been justified by his blood,
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:06.840]   we shall be saved from the wrath of God through him."
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:12.180]   Did you know that the way to God is this simple?
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:15.140]   And some of you, it bothers you.
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.480]   Some of you will say, "Pff, you don't know
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.120]   what I've done in my life."
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.240]   It can't be that simple.
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.740]   Sinners need to pay.
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:26.280]   Guess what, it's true, sinners do need to pay.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.120]   It can't be that simple that God is,
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.420]   what, he's just gonna let everybody into heaven?
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:32.580]   That's also true, God demands perfection,
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:34.380]   he will not let anybody into heaven.
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.980]   So what does God do?
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:39.200]   God says it must be this way.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.920]   The first is you must come humbly
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.360]   and to request forgiveness through repentance.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.920]   God, what we're talking about today in the Vandy of Life,
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.280]   I believe it.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.120]   This world is corrupt and so am I.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.720]   And I have sins in my life.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:57.160]   I have hurt the people that I love most.
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:00.080]   I have tried all the vices of the world.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.420]   I tried to go and solve it by myself.
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:04.640]   I'm at the end of me.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:07.560]   Will you forgive me?
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:10.520]   You come humble this way and I wanna tell you 100%
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.440]   God has prepared the way.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.640]   He has already shown and demonstrated
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.180]   through the sacrifice of his own son,
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:18.800]   the one he counts as pure and precious,
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.760]   that his life would pay for yours
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.320]   and therefore you can trust.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.600]   You can trust that Jesus in his death and resurrection
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.900]   paid for your sin and that perfection you long for
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:34.240]   is given to you by the resurrected life of Christ.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:37.040]   Christianity is not about people who said,
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.080]   God demands perfection and guess what?
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.320]   Here I am.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.080]   I'm the man.
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.400]   No, we are people who said,
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.480]   God intervened in my life
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:54.020]   and he showed me his grace to give me his forgiveness
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:55.920]   and I received that by faith.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:02.200]   There is one of the hardest things that humans will do
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.020]   is to receive help.
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:04.860]   Can I help you?
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:05.800]   - Nope.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.640]   - Are you lost?
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.460]   - Nope.
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:08.900]   - I know my way.
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:11.400]   One of the hardest thing that mankind will ever do
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:16.120]   is receive help because it pains us to know I can't.
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:19.040]   It pains us to know that we do not have the resource,
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:22.680]   the power or the know-how to fix the sin inside of us.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:27.440]   Christianity says, God knows that
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.120]   and that's the thing I wanna share with you,
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.600]   my own experience.
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:36.760]   I will tell you, I feel like I'm a humble man, but I'm not.
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:40.160]   I care way too much about the way people see me.
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:43.680]   I tried to fix that.
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.400]   So I pendulum swung.
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.200]   I went, you know what, I'm just stupid.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.680]   I would constantly be self-deprecating
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.760]   and I know some of you guys do that too.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.160]   You're constantly apologetic.
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:54.760]   I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:57.400]   And then you reacted in your flesh
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:00.840]   to the deficiency you saw in yourself
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.300]   and so you said, you know what, forget it.
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.000]   I'm gonna judge myself.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.160]   You know what that leads to?
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:08.560]   Self-condemnation and then suicide.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.880]   That's the end of that road.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.440]   The other side is to take the blue pill, right?
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.240]   And say, you know what, I'm not that bad.
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.840]   I can do it.
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.680]   I can work.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.000]   I don't care what you say.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.840]   The end of that is complete delusion
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:24.440]   and everybody sees it but you.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:30.160]   Right there in the middle, God says, Mark, I see you
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:35.840]   and just as you were disgusted by your own vain pride,
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:39.720]   I am so I'm gonna solve that.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.700]   Your life is gonna die with Christ
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:47.560]   and you're gonna have a new life in his resurrected power.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.460]   That's the Christian gospel.
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:51.440]   Not my flesh here or not my flesh there,
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.960]   the Christ who sees all of my sin
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.880]   but says, I, although I can be disgusted with you
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:00.200]   just as you were, I'm gonna come in
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.320]   and take all of that sin.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.080]   That's the message that we wanna preach to you
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.340]   who don't know Jesus yet.
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:11.120]   It's not that we wanna take away all your joys.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.760]   It's not that, you know, you can't touch that.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.080]   You can't have that luxury.
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.200]   That's not even the point.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:20.800]   We want you to have the power of God.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:24.520]   By way of conclusion, Jesus, the Lord, he said in Matthew,
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:31.280]   in Matthew chapter 16, for what will it profit a man
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:35.200]   if he gains a whole world and yet forfeits his soul?
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.480]   I began this sermon telling you,
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:41.540]   nothing on earth, no matter how valuable you see it,
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:42.560]   is worth it.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:47.120]   But the one, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:52.120]   who can save your soul eternity, he is worth it all.
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:53.520]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:03.080]   Lord, we thank you for this grace
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:06.180]   to hear the gospel message of salvation
[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:09.120]   that from ages ago you have prepared a way
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:11.960]   for sinners to be reconciled to you.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:13.240]   Lord, you tell us in the scriptures
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:14.680]   that through your son, Jesus Christ,
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.960]   you are doing the work of reconciling the lost
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:21.680]   to yourself that you would bring those who are fallen,
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:25.880]   those who are completely lost, to your loving arms.
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.320]   And I pray every single person here
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:33.320]   would experience that grace of being received by you,
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:36.020]   to be known by the loving Father,
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:37.960]   to be adopted into your house,
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.520]   and to have all the rights and privileges
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.040]   of being called your own.
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:45.420]   I pray, Father God, that that would be
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:48.780]   what motivates and fuels all of our worship,
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:52.140]   all of our time here together.
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:56.480]   Help us, Father God, to see just how worthy you are.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.440]   And I ask now that your spirit would convict
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.920]   the hearts of those who have maybe been hesitant
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:03.680]   to come to repentance,
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.860]   who have been thinking on the outskirts about it
[01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:07.960]   but not yet making a decision.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.400]   Help them to know, Father God,
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.840]   it is not about man striving at all.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:14.880]   It's about your grace and love.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.980]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name, amen.
