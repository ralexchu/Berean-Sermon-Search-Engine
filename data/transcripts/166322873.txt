[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   [silence]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles to Romans chapter 4,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   it's going to be part 2 of last week's sermon,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   "That Salvation is Promised and Not Negotiated," part 2.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   I'm going to be reading from verse 16 and on.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Reading out of the ESV.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   [reading]
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   [reading]
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   [reading]
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   [reading]
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   [reading]
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   [reading]
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   [reading]
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   [reading]
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   [reading]
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   [reading]
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   [reading]
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   [reading]
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   [reading]
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   [reading]
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   [reading]
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   [reading]
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   [reading]
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   [reading]
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   [reading]
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   [reading]
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   [reading]
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   [reading]
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Again, so the first four chapters of Romans, we've been talking about
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   the foundation of the Gospel. And again, every part of what we are talking about
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   is a different element of the Gospel that is being pounded over and over again.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Why this is so essential to our faith. And I think out of all the Bible study
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   materials that I've ever gone through to lead somebody to Christ, and then once they
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   become a Christian, like what material do we go through? What are some of the first
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   things that we need to talk about? And I would say probably most of the materials
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   that I've seen usually goes through assurance of salvation. Whether it's from
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Navigators or CCC or Southern Baptist or whatever Bible study material, one of the
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   first things that every group that comes at us, what is the first thing that we need
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   to make sure that the brand new Christian is assured of is his salvation. So you go
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   through the Gospel message and why we can have assurance. We talked about last week
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   what is unique about our Christian faith is that we are able to have this assurance.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Where John says in 1 John 5, "I write these things to you so that you may know that you
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   have eternal life." That we have assurance that when we die we are not rolling the dice
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   standing before God saying, "Hopefully that I've done enough good. Hopefully that my
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   good outweigh the bad and then hopefully that we'll be able to get to Heaven." But we
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   are assured by the blood of Christ. And the reason why we are assured, we talked about
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   last week, the first of the three points that we talked about, is that it is based
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   upon His promise and not by our works. So He said, one, why it has to be promised is
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   because we are promised to be heirs of the world. That that's not something that you
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   and I can add to. You can't just wake up one day and say, "I want to be a child of
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Bill Gates." You can't add to that. You can't one day decide by your own will, "I'm
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   going to be a child of God and this is the way I'm going to do it." So the very nature
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   of our salvation requires that it is salvation completely by grace. And then He says, "If
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   you try in any other way to merit your salvation, it actually nullifies the promise. It is
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   either by grace or it is by your works. But it can't be both." Thirdly, He says,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   "Because it is based upon promise, it is absolutely guaranteed." It is guaranteed.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   It is not contingent upon you. It is not contingent upon your deeds. It is contingent upon
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   His promise. And He says, "Because it is by grace that we are guaranteed to have this
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   assurance." If our salvation is by faith and by faith alone, how can we be assured
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   that we have that faith? How can we be assured that your faith is actually genuine?
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   That it's not just wishful thinking? Years ago, there was a movement, and I think that
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   movement is still around today, but there was a movement called the Word Faith Movement.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Another way that they described this movement was Name It and Claim It Movement. That same
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   movement today is called the Health and Wealth Gospel Movement. And basically what that
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   movement teaches is that if you have faith, that faith is able to get you whatever you
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   want. So there was actually a book that I read years ago called The Fifth Dimension.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And in that book, it basically says that whatever it is that you desire, you want a Lamborghini
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   or you want a beautiful wife or you want to have a million dollars, whatever it is, that
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   if you have enough faith and you put it in an incubator of prayer, so some of the stuff
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   that you desire requires more incubation time. So you pray longer than other things, right?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And some of the things are not as difficult, so you put it in there, and then it's a little
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   bit of faith, a little bit of prayer, and then it works. But at the core of what that
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   movement is, is you have faith in faith. See, the only reason why faith is powerful is not
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   because of faith itself. It's because of the object of our faith. It is what we have faith
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   in. See, if you look at scripture, faith and hope is used almost interchangeably. In Hebrews
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   chapter 11, it says, "Now faith is the assurance of the things hoped for, the conviction of
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   things not seen." What do we hope for? What are the things that you desire? Faith is not
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   just some intangible thing that lays in your heart that you can't read. It's deep in here.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Faith is very tangible, because whatever it is that you are hoping for will affect your
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   decision. Whatever it is that you're hoping for will affect the path that you take. Let
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   me give you an example. Sometimes, the way we look at faith, the things that we hope
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   for, we hope for things that have nothing to do with Christ, and the way that we approach
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Christ is, Christ is a helper to get us to things that we hope for. Okay? And let me
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   explain what that means. Sometimes, our hope is money. We want to have more money, and
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   we think that if we have more money that we're going to have, you know, it's going to solve
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   our problems. So we come to Christ, hoping that Christ will help us to get more money.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Or sometimes we think our hope is in friendships or relationships. So we come to Christ hoping
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   that Christ will help us to have better relationships. And what we're really hoping for is something
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   else. And then we're using Christ, hoping that He'll help us to get us to what we're
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   really hoping for. Does that make sense? But what the Scripture is telling about when we
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   have faith is that faith causes us to hope in Christ. That hope is our, Christ is our
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   hope. Not just an avenue to get to the hope that we have. And that is why it's extremely
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   important that we understand why is Abraham the ultimate example of this faith? Why is
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   he called the father of faith? Because in verse 18 it says, "In hope he believed against
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   hope." Basically, what he was saying is that he had nothing else to hope for. He had nothing
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   else that he could hold onto, and his only hope was God and God alone. And that's what
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   revealed his genuine faith. What was revealed, again, a lot of times you can come to church
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   and where Christ is not your hope, and then you're kind of using Him to get to what you
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   really want, and then when God doesn't help you to get to what you're really hoping for,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   you're done with Him. You move on to something else. "Well, I prayed to Him, it didn't
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   work. So I'm going to try something else." Well, what we want to look at today is not
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   a placebo of faith, just wishful thinking, hoping that if I just do the right thing that
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   somehow things are going to go well. We talked about last week, again, the promise, why we're
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   able to have assurance because it's based upon promise. Today we're going to do the
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   other two parts where we're able to have assurance because this covenant that God made
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   was based upon God's power and not man's. Based upon God's power, not man's. And then
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   the third and final point is the covenant was based on God's faithfulness and not man's.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   So let's look at verse 17, the second point. The covenant, meaning the gospel and our
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   salvation, is based on God's power and not man's. Verse 17, it says, "I have made you
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   the father of many nations in the presence of the God in whom He believed, who gives
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist." Think about
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   the calling of Abraham. Abraham, it says, he believed in God simply because God said,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   "I will do it." There's no negotiating. He said, he didn't come before God. He said,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   "Well, give me about four years. Let me see what you have." God said, "Follow me and
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   I will make you a great nation." He just believed. I mean, it's crazy. It wasn't like
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   he was homeless and he had no money. Most scholars believe that Moses was probably a
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   rich man already at the War of Chaldeans. I mean, if you look at what he left the War
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   of Chaldeans with, he already was a pretty wealthy man. But all God said was, "Leave
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   all of that, pack it up, and go out into the desert where it's dangerous. You might
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   actually die because of all these bandits and greater nations surrounding you." And
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   he said, "The reason why he did that is because he believed. He believed that God
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   is able to bring people from the dead and to create things out of nothing." See, God
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   himself is the only creator. No human being ever creates anything. All we do is we're
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   creative with creation. Think about the magicians, especially the real good ones. David Blaine,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   he's actually the only guy I know. But David Blaine, right? Think about these great
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   magicians and the reason why they make all kinds of money and why even somebody like
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   me knows his name is because he's good at his trade. He kind of takes crazy stuff.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   He takes coins, he throws it out the window, and that coin that was marked goes to the
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   window and lands on the sidewalk on the other side. Wow, that's crazy. He would take
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   things and they would just boom, it just disappears and he makes it appear. So if you're a great
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   magician, you're good at presenting, you know, basically tricking people. But nobody
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   believes that he actually creates cars. Nobody actually believes that. You'd be crazy.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   It's like, "Wow, how did you do that?" And when we say, when we ask the question,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   "How did you do that?" We're not saying, "How did you put all the little pieces together
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   just like that in three seconds?" Right? What kind of trickery did you use? Is it a
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   mirror? Is it a camera? What is it? Because we understand that only God can create from
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   nothing. He's the only creator. The theologians call that ex nihilo, out of nothing.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   He creates from nothing. Psalm 33, verse 6, it says, "By the word of the Lord the
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   heavens were made, and by the breath of His mouth all their hosts." He's the only one
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   who actually creates anything. Psalm 33, 9, "For He spoke and He came to be. He
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   commanded and it stood firm." Years ago, there was a book called, "Why do bad
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   things happen to good people?" And the Rabbi Kushner tried to answer the question
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   of why the question of evil in the world. Why is there evil in the world? His
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   conclusion was twofold. One, either God is not good and He doesn't care. And He
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   actually enjoys seeing people suffer. And so maybe that's the reason why there is
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   evil in the world. And again, as a Rabbi, that is unacceptable. How can God be
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   evil? If God was evil, we would all, you know, we'd be all in danger. Like we
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   wouldn't be able to survive the next day if that was the case. So he said, "But
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   that may be an answer." But he said, "Obviously, that's not the correct answer."
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   And so he gave the second solution. The second solution is God is not powerful.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   And so what he was, what he was trying to present as an answer is that all the
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   evil is happening in the world because God does not have control. He doesn't have
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   the power to do anything about it. Obviously, it is absolutely unbiblical.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   It is absolutely blasphemous to even think that. God who created the universe
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   is absolutely powerful. And that's why in verse 18 when it says, "In hope he
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   believed against hope." Why? Because in Romans 4.21 he says, "He was fully
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   convinced that God was able to do what He had promised." He's able. Again, in
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Ephesians 3.20, he says, "Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly than
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   all we ask or think according to the power at work within us." He is able.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   The first and foremost, the thing that everybody wrestles with is, is he able?
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Can he do it? Can he? And he says clearly the reason why Abraham was able to
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   leave behind all this thing, walk into danger, is because God was able to
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   fulfill His promise. I can make promises to you. I'm going to make you all
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   millionaires. Right? I'm going to make you all millionaires. Now no one's going to
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   trust me because you know I don't have that. And you know that I don't have the
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   capability. So I can make all the promises in the world, but if I'm not
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   able to carry it out, it means absolutely nothing. It means absolutely nothing.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Right? But he says, first and foremost, God Himself. He can create. He's a
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   creator. And you're able to have confidence in Him because He's able to
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   do all things. Not only is He the creator, He says He is the recreator. He gives
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   life to the dead. And that's why at the end of Abraham's, at the end of Abraham's
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   life, where he is asked to give Isaac, the only possible way that God could
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   fulfill this promise was through Isaac. At least in our mind, Abraham was willing
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   to give it up. And the reason why he was able to give it up is because it says in
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Hebrews 11 19, he considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   from which figuratively speaking, he did receive him back. So his faith wasn't
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   simply about faith. It was faith based upon God's ability. That even in death,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   even in death, that he can still have hope. Remember the disciples? You know,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   the whole reason why they follow Jesus, why they left behind their comfort, their
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   businesses to follow Jesus, is because they knew that life was found in Christ.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   But even they had a difficult understanding because to them death was
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   final. As long as they didn't die, they knew that they would benefit from
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   walking with Christ. And Jesus made it very clear, "If you follow Me, I'm going
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   to the cross. You're going to have to pick up your cross too." And He made it
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   very clear that, "I'm going to Jerusalem. I'm going to be crucified. And I'm going
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   to be raised on the third day." Over and over again He tells them that. But they
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   hear it, but they don't hear it. Right? Because they don't understand. Because
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   death is final. In human experience, the worst thing that could happen to anybody
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   is death. So how can, if we're following Jesus to live, and He's telling us we're
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   going to die, and He's going to die, it makes no sense. So He was hearing them,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   but not hearing them. It wasn't until He is crucified and He's resurrected from
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   the dead, He comes back from life, that He realized this man has power even over
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   death. You know years ago I was out evangelizing out on campus and this guy
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   came and said, "You know what? Jesus never claimed to be God. The Son of God, maybe
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   a God or a prophet, but He never claimed to be God." And this was when I was I
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   think a second or third year Bible student at Biola. And so he definitely
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   knew the Bible better than I did. And so he just rocked me. I was like, "Uh, duh."
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   You know like I didn't have any answer for what he was saying. And so I took a
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   bunch of youth group students out with me. And I remember this one particular
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   student after that encounter, he looked at me and he's like, "Dude, he rocked you."
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   You know? Because he did. And so I was so discouraged. I went back to school and I
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   talked to my professors and I asked all my professors the questions that came up.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   And he had very simple like quick answers. It wasn't like deep complicated.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   It's like, "Oh, okay." And this guy was perverting Scripture. But through the
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   years one of the things that he said was, "Jesus never claimed to be God." And you
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   know we can have a whole year coming through Scripture where He does claim to
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   be God. But one of the greatest things that Jesus says, absolute confirmation of
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   His deity, John 5:21 He says, "For as the Father raises the dead and gives Him
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   life, so also the Son gives life to whom He will." Jesus basically said, "As the
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Father has the author of life, so does the Son." So if we hear that and say, "Did
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   He actually just say that?" See the Jews at that time heard exactly what Jesus was
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   saying. Right after this, they pick up stones and they try to stone Him. He said,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   "We're stoning you not because of the works that you've done. We're stoning you
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   because you being a mere man claim to be God." He never came out and said, "I am
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   God." But they clearly understood that what He was claiming can only be from
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   God. Again in John 10, 18, "No one takes it up from Me, but I lay it down of My own
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   accord." I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it up again.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Only God has that authority. Now why is this so important? Because if we don't, if
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   we're not convinced that He is able, that these are empty promises and all it is
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   is just a placebo, then Christianity is only about this life. Like if you
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   follow Jesus and you become healthy, and if you follow Jesus and you become
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   wealthy, then yeah, okay, this is worth it. But if God, if God is God and He's a
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Creator of the universe, then what causes us to persevere and to put our hope in
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Him is absolute belief that He is able. He is able. But here's the third and final
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   point that I think is where the rubber meets the road, right? My guess is that
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   most of us in this room believe that He is able. I don't think you'd be a
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Christian if you said, "You know what? God created the universe, but I don't know if
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   He can pay my bills, you know. God created the universe, but I don't know if He's
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   going to fulfill His promises, right? He gave His only begotten Son, but I'm not
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   sure if He's going to give us the other stuff, right?" I think most of us, if not
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   all of us, believe that He is able because we worship the Creator, right? Not
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   the creation. The struggle that we have, where the rubber meets the road, is this
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   God who is able, is He faithful? Is He faithful? Will He keep His promise? Now
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   that goes up and down, depending on sometimes where you are, right? Like
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   sometimes you feel like, "Oh, God's going to fulfill His promise if you do your
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   part." So when you've done your part, you're like, "Yes, you know, I'm convinced."
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   But as soon as you feel that there's some sin in your life that you're having a
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   hard time conquering, that question comes up. It's like, "I know He's able, right?
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   I know He's able, but will He keep His promise to me? Will He be faithful to me?"
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   See, again, the reason why Abraham is a father of faith, and the perfect example
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   of this faith, he says he had hope against hope. He believed that he is able,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   but not only was he able, but he is faithful. Look at verse 19 and 20. "He did
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   since he was about a hundred years old, when he considered the barrenness of
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Sarah's womb. No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God." Do you remember Abraham's
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   name before he met God was Abram. What does that mean, Abram? Like glorified
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   father, right? And he's like the great father. That's what that means, right?
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   You ever wonder why his father may have named him that, Abram? Like today, you
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   know, when we name our children, you know, some people name their children
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   because some Disney movie, or you know what I mean? It just sounds nice, but you
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   know, like, but some of you guys, you know, put some thought into it, and it's
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   like, oh, we like a child of God, or prophet of God, or something, right? But
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   we give names sometimes because we are hoping that God will be faithful, and
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   that maybe the meaning of His name is we are hoping and praying that God will
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   fulfill that in their life. And in the Old Testament, in the biblical times, no
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   name was given flippantly. They gave with some purpose. Why was Abram named
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Abram? This is my guess. He comes from a pretty wealthy family, or Chaldeans. So,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   my guess is his father, maybe grandfather, was thinking, well, now you
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   have a really good start, and we have all this wealth that we can kind of get
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   behind you. And so, our hope and desire is that you would be a great father. At
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   that time, you could have all the wealth in the world, but if you don't have
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   descendants, it dies with you, right? So, today, you know, we say, oh, you can't
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   take it with you, but the way they thought was, well, you can't take it with
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   you, but you can leave it all behind to your descendants, right? So, if you don't
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   have descendants, all of that would have been it. That's where it would end. So, I
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   believe that his parents probably named him Abram, hoping that all the things
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   that his maybe father and grandfather accumulated, that all these great
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   descendants of Abram will be a beneficiary of this. And that's why they
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   named him this. By the time God shows up in his life, he's already 70, and he has
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   no children. And his wife is barren. And so, God calls this guy who maybe already
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   have given up. All his life, Abram, glorified father, great father, you know.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   And by the time God shows up, he probably already has given up. So, imagine, you
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   know, being called great father with no children. You know, it's almost like
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   calling somebody a small stature, big guy. "Hey, big guy." You know what I mean?
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   It's almost mocking him. Or sometimes you do something really foolish, and then
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   they say, "Hey, genius." Right? "Hey, genius." Right? So, it's almost like calling
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Abram a glorified father, every time he probably heard his name, as a reminder of
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   the position that he was in. So, God calls him, and he says, "Follow me. I will
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   make your descendants multiply. You can't even count them." So, I think for Abram,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   it was a very personal promise. It wasn't just a kind of generic promise. This is
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   something that he's been hoping and praying for. And God said, "If you follow
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   me." And he just goes out. Right? Because he believed. He believed that he is able
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   to fulfill this promise. But the thing is, God made this promise, but for the first
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   25 years. For the first 25 years, it doesn't happen. In fact, it's almost
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   comical. If you read verse 19, he said, "He did not weaken in faith when he
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   considered his own body, which was as good as dead." Right? That's pretty harsh.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   He's old, but he's not dead yet. But he said, "As good as dead." In other words,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   there's no possible hope for him. Not only is there no hope for him, because
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   he's so old, he's as good as dead. Right? He said, "But since about, he was 100
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   years old, but also consider his wife. She was also as good as dead. Her womb has
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   been closed." And so, God waits until there's absolutely no hope to fulfill
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   this. And then, that's when he steps in. And if you notice, you know, God names
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   him. Here's a guy, he's like all his life, he's like, "Hey, Abram." You know? What does
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   he change his name to? "Abraham." And what does the name Abraham mean? "Father of
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   multitudes." Right? I mean, it's like, "Hey, genius." And he said, you know, "Hey,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Einstein." You know what I mean? Like, you're taking a difficult name, and you're
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   making it impossible now. It's almost mocking. Right? But God tells him, "Your
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   name is going to be Abraham, when he has no descendants, and there's no hope
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   whatsoever. And then it isn't until there's absolutely no hope, nothing that
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   they can cling to, and God shows up, and he fulfills his promise." Isn't that
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   exactly the way God works? In verse 19, he says, "He did not weaken in faith when he
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   considered his own body." He was just as good as dead. He had absolutely no hope.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   And then God comes in, and he gives him a child. Isn't that what the Scripture says,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   of what he was doing in the Old Testament? Think about Israel's history.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   Like, why did God give the law? If the law wasn't going to fulfill God's promise of
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   salvation, why did He give the law in the first place? He says, "So that the law
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   would make sin utterly sinful." Now, I want you to understand the fulfillment of
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   this in Israel's history. If you look at Israel's history, it's a constant cycle
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   of rebelling against God, God bringing judgment, they repent, and then God
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   restores them. And then when they get restored, they forget God, and then they
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   rebel, God judges them, He forgives them, and then they get restored. It is a
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   constant cycle, over and over again. But every time that judgment comes and they
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   get restored, they go back to the same determination, right? Over and over again.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   "We won't fail you." You know, I know, we learned our lesson. We learned our
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   lesson. And we're not going to do this. I know why the Babylonians came. I know why
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   the Assyrians came. I know why the Midianites came. I know why the Philistines
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   came. I know why judgment came over and over and over again. But every time they
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   get restored, what was their conviction? "We won't fail you." As their whole
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   history was about their determination to keep the law. And that's the reason why
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   the Pharisees were so committed to keeping the law. They weren't going to
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   make the same mistakes as their forefathers. They went into captivity
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   because they refused to obey the law. They said, "No, we're not going to make that
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   same mistake." And that's why they wanted to get rid of Jesus. This guy's telling
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   people to not to obey the Sabbath law. It's better to get rid of one
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   troublemaker than to bring the wrath of Rome and God upon us again. So each time
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   God restores them, they're determined. "We're not going to fail you." And so each
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   time, each time they were determined, and each time they fell, sin became
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   utterly sinful, absolutely hopeless. See the whole purpose of Israel's history is
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   to allow them to get to a point where they realize they have absolutely no
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   hope. There was no hope. There was no hope for their government. There was no hope
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   for somebody to come and save. There was no hope for power. They tried everything
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   and nothing worked. And God was waiting for them to get to that point, as God was
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   waiting for Abraham to get to a point where he said he was good as dead.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   She was already barren before they met him, and 30 years later it was even worse.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   But he said faith. He had faith. When there was no faith, there was nothing to
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   cling on, because the only thing that they were able to hope for was God himself.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   In fact, if you look at 1 Corinthians 1, 26-29, he says, "Here's this Corinthians
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   church thinking that somehow God may have chosen them because some of them were
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   more prominent than others." And he says, "Do you not know that God chose you
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   because you were of no repute? Because you have nothing that man could say, 'Oh,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   that's why God chose you.'" God chose you because when the world looks at you
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   and says, "That? God chose you?" 1 Corinthians 1, 26-29. "But God chose what
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   is foolish in the world to shame the wise. God chose what is weak in the world
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   to shame the strong. God chose what is low and despised in the world, even
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   things that are not, to bring nothing, the things that are, so that no human being
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   might boast in the presence of God." The promise of God is not about you.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   It is not about me. It's not a display to put you on a pedestal and say, "Look how
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   precious they are! Look what I—how I made them!" God's promise was a display of
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   His own glory. Because it was the glory of God that we missed. It was the glory
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   of God that we'd fallen short of. So if it was the glory of God that we'd fallen
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   short of, it was the glory of God that has to be restored. So He displayed His
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   mercy to glorify Himself. Psalm 106 verse 7, "Yet He saved them for His
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   namesake, that He might make known His mighty power." His power. Isaiah 48 verse
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   9, "For My namesake I defer My anger; for the sake of My praise I restrain it for
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   you, that I may not cut you off." It was to display His mercy and His glory.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   That's why God waited. When it said the perfect time came, it was when Israel had
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   absolutely nothing to hold on to. They're utterly helpless. And even during Jesus'
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   ministry, even during Jesus' ministry, He spent most of His time—remember when we
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   were going through the Gospel?—most of His time in the three cities. And at the
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   end of three years of ministry in the cities, what happened? They reject Him.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Right? John chapter 6, 66, remember that? 666. Is when all the people, the miracles
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   that He performed, the miraculous food that He gave to them, and their end result?
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   We don't want it. And then how was He crucified? The very people that He loved
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   and cherished, He died in their hands. I mean you think about hopelessness. When
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Jesus went to that cross, yes He went voluntarily, but His own people, His own
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   people, leaders of His own people who were created to glorify Him, put Him on
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   that cross. We talk about hope, like having no hope. If there was any period
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   when Israel had absolutely no hope, was when Jesus was being led to the cross. It
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   was as dark as you can possibly be. And it was in that, it was in that darkness,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   God's glory was at display. He said it was for His glory. And that's why we have
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   assurance. Because it was never about you. It was never about me. We are the
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   benefactors. We benefit from Him glorifying Himself, from Him displaying
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   His grace. But He is faithful to Himself. Number 2319, God is not a man that He
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   should lie, or the Son of Man that He should change His mind. Has He said and
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   will He not do it, or has He spoken and will He not fulfill it? That God fulfills
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   His promise for His namesake. But look at what He says in verse 20, "But no
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   distrust made Him waver," Abraham, "concerning the promise of God, but grew
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   strong in his faith as he gave glory to God." Fully convinced that God was able
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   to do what He had promised. So let's stop right here, okay? He said, "Abraham did
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   not have distrust and he did not waver concerning his promise." And I want you
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   to think carefully about Abraham's life. Did he ever waver? Think carefully, okay?
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Don't give a knee-jerk answer because, "No, he didn't." That's what it says here,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   right? But I want you to, I want you to think carefully. Like, did he ever waver?
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Humanly speaking. I can think of a few instances, right? Both times when he was
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   out in the desert and he was so afraid that somehow the higher powers are going
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   to basically take his life because his wife was so beautiful. So he had this
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   great plan that, "Throw her under the bus," right? And say, "This is my sister,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   and do whatever you want with her, but please save me," all right? Man of faith.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Never waver. And this happens twice. You know what I mean? This happens twice.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   And then, why is his son named Isaac? What does Isaac mean? Laughter. Now, did
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   God name him Laughter because God said, "I'm going to give you a son." Ishmael
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   is not. That was your, that was in the flesh. That was not fulfilling a promise.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   I'm going to do it, right? But a real descendant, and his name is going to be
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Isaac. But why did he name him Isaac? He named him Laughter. It wasn't because
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Isaac and Sarah heard this like, "Oh, thank you, Lord." Okay, we're going to name
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   him son Laughter. Is that what that laughter meant? When God finally promised,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   He said he was as good as dead. He was completely barren. He said, "I mean, we
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   had no hope when we were 70. Now we're 100. We had absolutely no chance whatsoever."
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   So when God said, "It's not Ishmael. You're going to have a true descendant,"
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   remember the response? Like, "God's crazy." God saw that, and He said, "I will name
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   your son Laughter because you didn't believe Me." Right? That's why their son
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   was named Laughter. As a constant reminder to them, "You didn't believe Me."
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   So when he said, "He didn't waver concerning the promise of God." Is that a
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   contradiction? That Paul forgot about Israel's history and Abraham's history?
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Is that what he means? I hope you didn't say yes because then you have a problem
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   with inerrancy. All right? So, of course, it's not a contradiction. But what does
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   he mean then? If Abraham didn't waver in unbelief, I think he means the exact same
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   thing when Jesus says to Peter in Luke chapter 22, He says, "I pray for you so
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   that your faith would not fail you because Satan has asked permission to
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   sift you like wheat." Peter says, "I will not fail you. Even if everybody else
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   fails you, I will not fail you." Remember what Jesus says? "Oh, you're going to
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   fail Me. And you're going to fail Me three times. The rooster's not going to crow
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   until you deny Me three times to My face." Wait a second. He just prayed for
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   him. He just prayed that his faith would not fail him. And then he just said,
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   "You're going to fail." And then he said, "But when you get back up, feed my
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   sheep. Feed my sheep." So what did it mean for Peter not to fail? That he would get
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   back up. He would get back up and continue. You see what he says to Abraham?
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Abraham didn't waver in unbelief, but he grew strong in his faith. He grew strong
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   in his faith. His faith became stronger and stronger as he continued to follow
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   God. And he didn't turn back because his hope was firmly placed on God. He didn't
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   quit because he trusted in Him. Isn't that our experience? We believe that He is
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   able. But our problem is, I know He is capable, but will He be faithful to the
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   promise to me? And the reason why we wrestle with that is because week after
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   week, we see our own struggles. And we can't discipline ourselves. The goals
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   that we've met, we've made, we've achieved some, but there's a bunch of stuff that
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   we weren't able to achieve. We're not where we thought that we would be at the
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   age that we're at. We don't know the Scripture as much as we hoped that we
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   would. We didn't evangelize to as many people as we were hoping for. And so we
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   have this burden on us. I know He is capable, but maybe I didn't earn His
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   grace. And that question causes you to question His faithfulness to you. I know
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   He is capable, but is He faithful to me? And the answer is emphatic yes, because
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   His faithfulness is to His own glory. It is to His own glory. It is to display His
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   mercy. It is to display His grace, so that when we look upon the cross, we see
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   Him. He fulfills His promise, and that's why He says He guarantees it. He
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   guarantees it. His purpose, and His nature, and His promise never changes. And if we
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   believe this, if we truly believe this, we will change. We will change. That's why
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   it says in Romans chapter 4, 20 to 25, "That is why His faith was counted to Him
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   as righteousness. But the words it was counted to Him were not written for His
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   sake alone, but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in Him, who
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   raised Him from the dead, Jesus our Lord, who was delivered up for our trespasses
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   and raised for our justification." This is why we have assurance of salvation.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   This is why we have assurance of salvation. We became followers of Christ
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   because we knew He was able. But we persevere because we know He is faithful.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   He's faithful. God does not make promises that He does not fulfill. Our salvation
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   is firmly in His grasp. His grasp, not ours. Yes, we ought to be better Christians.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   Yes, we ought to read our Bible more. We ought to pray more. We ought to evangelize
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   more. But our assurance of salvation is not shaken, as long as our hope is in
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   Christ and Christ alone. Let's take a few minutes to pray, coming before God. And I
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   know sometimes it can sound like semantics, but it's a world of difference
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   between somebody who's living by faith and living by the flesh. A person who
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   lives by faith is a person who's constantly responding and thanksgiving
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   for what he has done. And so everything that we do is an expression of thank you.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Thank you for loving a sinner like me. Thank you for putting up with me.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   Even despite all the distractions, even though I've been praying and asking for
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   repentance for the same thing for the last 10 years. Despite all of that, thank
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   you. Thank you for being faithful to your own promises, for showing your love
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   toward me while I was yet a sinner. So I want to encourage you this morning, as
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   you come before the Lord, if you've been weighed down by your sins, come before
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   the Lord in repentance. Ask the Lord for forgiveness. He is faithful and just to
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   forgive you of all your unrighteousness. Then once you're forgiven, live your life
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   in thanksgiving. Offer your body as a living sacrifice, reasonable response to
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   the grace of God. Let's take some time as we ask the worship team to come up. And
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   again, I want to remind you, you know, prayer, the most effective prayer is the
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   most honest prayer. Not the most theologically rich, not because you have
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   the most Bible verses in your prayer, but the most honest prayer. I believe, help
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   my unbelief. I believe, help my unbelief. Let's take some time to come before the
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   Lord and to connect with the only God that we have any hope in.
