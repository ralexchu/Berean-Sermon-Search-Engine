[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   Take me to Romans chapter 12.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.520]   I'm going to read verse 9 through 13.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.600]   My original plan, if you look at your program, it says up to 13, but I'm not going to get
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.160]   to verse 13, and I am not going to get to verse 12 either.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.160]   Okay?
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.640]   So I explained to the first service that as I was preparing, my intent was to get to 13,
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.120]   and as I was preparing, I said, "Well, this is too much material.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.520]   Let me take it down to 12."
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.040]   Then as I was preparing, even last night, I took about half a page of notes, outline,
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.760]   and I took it out, and then at night as I was reviewing, I put it all back in, and then
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.320]   I put some more in after that, and I realized I'm not going to be able to make it all the
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.320]   way.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.600]   It'll be too long.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.360]   But neither did I want to take out certain important stuff in here, so we're most likely
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.200]   going to get to 11, and then 12, 13, hopefully by next week.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.200]   Okay?
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.600]   But I'm going to read from verse 9 up to verse 13 before we get started.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.600]   Let love be genuine.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.920]   Abhor what is evil.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.280]   Hold fast to what is good.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.880]   Love one another with brotherly affection.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.080]   Outdo one another in showing honor.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.620]   Do not be slothful in zeal.
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.160]   Be fervent in spirit.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.160]   Serve the Lord.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.160]   Rejoice in hope.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.920]   Be patient in tribulation.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.680]   Be constant in prayer.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.720]   Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.720]   Let's pray.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.720]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:44.360]   Lord, sometimes it can just become habit, coming to church and worshiping, and we know,
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.200]   Father, you deserve much more than that.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.320]   We want to express our love for you, our appreciation for your perseverance in us, not only for
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.420]   saving us, but being patient, Lord God, through our sanctification.
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.120]   We thank you, Father, for your Holy Spirit.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:09.460]   We thank you for your living Word that reveals to us your thoughts, your heart, your intentions.
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.720]   Help us to understand these things, Lord God, not simply for knowledge, that we may change,
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.120]   that we may continue to reflect who you are through our lives.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.600]   So we pray for your blessing and your Holy Spirit's power to be revealed in your Word.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.600]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.600]   Amen.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.280]   As you guys know, last week I wasn't here.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.320]   I was up at BMC, and they were celebrating their fifth anniversary.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.720]   And so, you know, it's been five years already since we sent out that team up there, and
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.920]   in the five years they've been gone through, obviously you guys know, you know, what kind
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.240]   of stuff that they went through, but in five years they've grown tremendously.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.000]   I've been there, I think, about a year, maybe a little bit less than a year ago, and last
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.920]   time I visited they had maybe about 120, and this time I went and they had, they're almost
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.360]   kind of hitting 200, and as a result of that they're having some growing pains.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.920]   In addition to the facility that they're in, they can fit maybe about 260, 250, 260 people,
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.760]   and so they're kind of debating whether they're going to go to the gym or they're going to
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.400]   find another location, but again, these issues are coming because, you know, they're growing,
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   they're maturing.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.960]   So I was very thankful that I was able to be there and to share it in the time that
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.440]   they have, but I ask you to continue to keep them in your prayers.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.200]   I just remember that when our church was growing and we hit about 200, that was the period
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.000]   when it was the most challenging for us.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.080]   So some of you guys who were there during that period, not that they're all gone, but
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.200]   that was the most challenging, when our church culture kind of changed and there was a lot
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.960]   of challenges and the workload was doubling and tripling at that time, and all because
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.200]   God was sending people to the church.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.200]   And so if you guys can, again, continue to keep them in your prayers, pray that the Lord
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.600]   would use them, give the leadership wisdom, that they wouldn't be tired out and know how
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.280]   to adjust certain things to be able to manage the growing number of people that are coming
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.280]   to the church.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:11.520]   You know, when Pastor Aaron asked me to come up and to, again, to address the church in
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.040]   their fifth anniversary, I knew that we had a football game on Saturday.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.600]   Our elite sisters were going to go, and for the last five or six years, I wasn't able
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.860]   to go, so I was really trying hard.
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.320]   So I asked Pastor Aaron to make sure, give me the latest flight out of Orange County
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.320]   so that I could watch the football game.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.880]   You know, I'm not talking about Super Bowl, I'm talking about the real football game that
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.800]   took place on Saturday.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.920]   And so, you know, he got me the latest flight, and then I was all, you know, geared to go
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.280]   after our meeting and then found out that they were having it in San Diego.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.120]   You know, so I was up at the hotel up in San Francisco texting with our brother James,
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.680]   and he was kind of giving me an update of what's going on.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.680]   And then I saw your video clips of the win and how excited you guys were, and I was excited
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.880]   with you.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.200]   And I know some people may look at that and say, "Well, what a, you know, that's a lot
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.600]   of time being spent that has nothing to do with God."
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.600]   Right?
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.720]   Two, three, four months, and then the next eight months thinking about it, right?
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.240]   You know, people can complain, look at that.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.960]   And I think if we're not careful and we just let football be football, yeah, it is a lot
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.000]   of time wasted that has nothing to do with God, if that's all it is.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.560]   That you guys had fun, had great opportunity to fellowship and to get to know one another.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:31.160]   And if it ends in just having more people to go to Disneyland with, you know, to celebrate
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.360]   birthdays and to just have more friends at church, if that's all it ends in, yeah, then
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.200]   it is a great waste of time, no matter how excited you were, no matter how many games
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.620]   you win.
[00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.120]   My hope and prayer is that all the things that you've gained, all the fellowship, and
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.600]   that's the thing that I keep hearing over and over, that they really love the camaraderie
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.640]   among the sisters.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.000]   And with that camaraderie, what will we do with it?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.560]   With the friendships and the community, in football, out of football, whatever it is
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.220]   that we're building, what are we doing with that?
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.720]   Is it just more friends to hang out with?
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.840]   Is it just a better community where people know me and I know them?
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.720]   But to really use every good gift that God has given and to be intentional about spurring
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.960]   one another on toward loving good deeds, that make sure Christ is the reason why we're gathered
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.360]   together, that all the friendships that we build, that we don't just use that to have
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.600]   fun with, but that we're running this race together.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.160]   So anything that causes us to build a greater community would lead to greater honor and
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.320]   glory to God.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.120]   And so my prayer is that it would not just end in football, but that football would only
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.680]   be an avenue to honor and glorify God.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.760]   Now I say all of this because that's the text that we're in.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.160]   Paul has been expositing for 11 chapters about the in-depth presentation of the gospel, and
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:57.480]   he says in light of this grace, we should also offer our bodies, as Christ gave himself
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.840]   for us, that we ought to offer our bodies as a living sacrifice, that this is a reasonable,
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.640]   logical, spiritual act of worship.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:11.960]   And then he told us in verses 3 to 8, the avenue in which we are to live this life of
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.300]   sacrifice in the church.
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.680]   So God has given us different gifts, and that we are to use these gifts to build each other
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.120]   up to honor and glorify God.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.760]   So he gave us the arena in which we are to practice this Christian faith.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.680]   How do we first respond to this grace?
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.080]   Well, respond in a way that honors and glorifies God in the context of the church.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.940]   The section that we're in now, starting from verse 9 to verse 21, is a rapid-fire presentation
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.840]   of the imperatives.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.640]   And there's about 21 to 24 of them based upon how you divide this.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.000]   He just, one after another, to do this, to do this, and then do this, and then do this,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   and then do this.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.600]   He doesn't sit there, like, elaborating on any of these things.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.360]   He just wants to know that this is a, again, there's about 21 to 24, but in no way is this
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.820]   comprehensive to everything that we know about what it means to be a Christian.
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:08.160]   And he doesn't go into in-depth description of what he is trying to say.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.340]   He just gives a long presentation of, these are things that we ought to give our thought
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.400]   and our mind and our zeal toward.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.920]   He doesn't just say, "Hey, you should be a good Christian."
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.320]   He doesn't just say, "Hey, you should have affection for Christ."
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.720]   He gives us, like, this is what it should look like.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:30.760]   So in verse 9, he began this list by reminding us that the greatest of these commandments
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.400]   is to love.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.680]   In verse 9, it says, "Let love be genuine.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.880]   Abhor what is evil.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.360]   Hold fast to what is good.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.560]   Love one another with brotherly affection.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.600]   Outdo one another in showing honor."
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:49.280]   So if you look at this list of 21 to 24 imperatives, they don't all directly connect to love, loving
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.680]   God and loving our neighbors.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.880]   But whenever you see a list of things in the Bible, it's there for a reason.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.880]   It's never random.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:03.280]   When you see the list of the apostles, Peter's name is always on the top, and it is never
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.280]   random.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.200]   It's because Peter was the head guy.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.300]   He was the leader among the disciples.
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.900]   So his name is always on the top.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:16.640]   If you see a list of immorality that we are to avoid and to shun, these lists of sins,
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.540]   sexual immorality is almost always on the top.
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.960]   It is never random.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.580]   It is very deliberate that these are things that God wants to pay special attention to.
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:31.420]   So the fact that on the top of the list, the first two verses emphasizes the practice of
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.440]   love with brothers and sisters, it is not by accident.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.240]   It is deliberately highlighted.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.260]   And we mentioned that, I mentioned that a couple weeks ago when we exposited the first
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.880]   couple verses.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.360]   In Galatians 5.14, it says, "For the whole law is fulfilled in one word.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.640]   You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:55.280]   Everything, all the imperatives, whether it is directly connected to it or not, he said
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:01.240]   all of it is summarized in love the neighbor as yourself, to love.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.800]   Again, Philippians 1, 2, 1 and 2, it says, "If there is any encouragement in Christ,
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:11.040]   any comfort in love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.760]   my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.760]   mind."
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:22.960]   Again, he is not speaking to a select group of Christians who are experiencing this spiritual
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.880]   fervor for God that other Christians are not.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.280]   He is basically saying, if you are a Christian, if you have repented and you find any encouragement
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.720]   in Christ, if you have any fellowship with the Holy Spirit, any participation for His
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:40.480]   affection, in other words, if you are a true Christian, make every effort to be of the
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.880]   same mind, to practice this love.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:50.640]   Again, in 1 Thessalonians 4, 9 and 10, this model church that Paul says that their reputation
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.080]   of their genuine conversion is being spread all over Macedonia, that he doesn't even have
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.040]   to tell people about who they are.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.200]   He said that people are talking about them, how they came to faith and how the genuine
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.080]   Christianity is being practiced, and this is what he says to this church, "Now concerning
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.760]   brotherly love, you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves have been
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.000]   taught by God to love one another."
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.320]   What does he mean by that?
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.360]   Is he saying that to the Thessalonians that there was some kind of special revelation
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.980]   that God opened up heaven and He was speaking audibly to them, that He wasn't speaking to
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:25.980]   other churches?
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.980]   Is that what he is saying?
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.720]   Was it some special revelation that only the Thessalonians had in saying, "I don't need
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.480]   you, I don't need to tell you about love because God Himself is teaching you directly."
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.680]   I don't think that that's what Paul is saying here.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:44.840]   What Paul is saying is that the practice of love is so fundamental to our faith that you
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.020]   can't preach the gospel without preaching love.
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:52.260]   There would be no gospel, there would be no salvation, there would be no heaven and hell,
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:57.420]   there would be no incarnation, there would be no church without love.
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:02.920]   So what Paul is saying is, "I don't even need to mention this to you because the very fact
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.320]   that you became a Christian, you're already being taught by God that you ought to love."
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:11.740]   That's how fundamental it is to our faith, that these aren't some extra instructions
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.780]   I need to give you.
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.520]   You can't be a Christian if you don't recognize this.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.960]   Verse 10, "For that indeed is what you are doing to all the brothers throughout Macedonia."
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.600]   He said that's what makes them a model church because they were actually already practicing
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.600]   this love.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:31.440]   He said, "But we urge you, brothers, to do this more and more."
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.640]   That's how important it was.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.480]   Here's this model church who's already practicing this love and he doesn't say, "Well, you're
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.480]   doing a great job."
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.840]   You know, he's just kind of back off a little bit, you know, don't push yourself too hard
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.840]   and don't get burnt out.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.520]   He says, "No, you're doing this, but do this more and more."
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.040]   This is something that you need to be pursuing.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.920]   This is something that you need to be working on and sacrificing to the day you die, to
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.960]   this more and more.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:02.640]   So there is no way that I can exaggerate the importance of this character.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:07.240]   You know, when we talk about spiritual maturity, we have various things that we can look at
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:12.520]   to see how mature somebody is, like how committed are they to church?
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.400]   How do they use their time, their discipline?
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.800]   How many people have they shared the gospel with?
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.760]   We have, you know, depending on what your perspective is, we all have a different measuring
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.920]   stick, right?
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.240]   Some of them overlap, some of them are very different.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.240]   Some things are very important to you and some things may not be as important, right?
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:34.060]   So if you happen to be one of those people who love theology, you tend to measure other
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.760]   people's maturity based upon how much theology that you think they know.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:43.800]   If you happen to be a prayer warrior and you tend to, you know, measure everybody else,
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.880]   well, how much do they pray?
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.360]   So we all have our own perspective of how we think.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.920]   Like these are people that respect, these are people that we think are mature.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.760]   Now none of these things are necessarily wrong, they are in scripture.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.800]   But above all of these things, you can have all of that and yet not have love, the scripture
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.760]   says it is absolutely nothing.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.980]   It is nothing.
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.720]   You can have theology without love, it's nothing.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.340]   You can have devotion without love, it is nothing.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.160]   You can pray without love, it's nothing.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:16.120]   In fact, remember he says, "You can give your body to be burnt and have not love, it is
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.120]   nothing."
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.560]   You can be martyred and be nothing.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.600]   That's how important it is.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.960]   It is not just better, it is the thing that God desires from us.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.780]   It is the thing that he wants us to practice.
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.720]   So how do we measure maturity?
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:37.320]   If there's one quality that we ought to look at and measure by, it's love.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.080]   Like how do I know if I'm mature?
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.080]   It's practice of love.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.080]   How passionately am I practicing this love?
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.000]   Am I reflecting this love?
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.880]   So in verse 11 and on, he may not specifically mention the word love, but we know that the
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.960]   application of all of these things ultimately is expression of love.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.120]   So let's look at verse 11.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:04.000]   He says, "In this practice of obedience and offering your bodies a living sacrifice, do
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   not be slothful in zeal."
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.320]   Do not be slothful in zeal.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:16.320]   The word slothful, depending on what translation you have, has been either translated lacking
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.040]   or lagging, slothful.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:26.440]   And the word for zeal in other translations have been translated diligence, or like here
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.400]   it says zeal, or business.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:35.480]   So these are words that, again, there are a little bit of differences and nuances, but
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:40.440]   at the end of the day, he's basically saying, don't be lazy in the things that God has called
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.000]   you to do.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:51.240]   Don't be slothful, lagging, and nonchalant about what God has called you to do.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.080]   In obedience, do not delay.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.680]   That's basically what he is saying.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:04.360]   If you've ever raised children, typically children don't say no.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:09.280]   Of course they say no, but when they want to disobey you, a lot of times the way that
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.640]   they disobey is delaying.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.480]   Take out the trash.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.200]   Okay.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.840]   You know, four hours later, it hasn't been taken out.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.600]   I told you to take out the trash.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.320]   He's like, I will.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.840]   It's never a no, because he knows it's his responsibility.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.360]   You're supposed to do the dishes.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.840]   Yeah, I know.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.360]   Well, how come it's not done?
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.760]   I'm planning to do it.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.280]   You come back later part of the day and the dishes aren't done.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.280]   How come you didn't do the dishes?
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.800]   You're supposed to do the dishes.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.800]   That's your job.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.380]   Yeah, I know.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.720]   I'm going to do it.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.040]   1130 at night, the dishes aren't done.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.200]   How come you didn't do it?
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.360]   I'm about to do it.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.160]   I'm about to do it.
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.300]   You wake up in the morning and it's still there.
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.360]   How come you didn't do the dishes?
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.520]   I was about to do it.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.880]   Then I had to do something and I fell asleep, but I mean to do it.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:04.880]   Don't worry.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.880]   Get off my back.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.400]   Usually, a lot of times it's not no.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.480]   It's usually delayed.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.820]   It's delayed because we don't want to do it.
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:16.820]   We don't want to do it now.
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:21.980]   Oftentimes, our disobedience is not expressed with, "No, God, I'm not going to do it.
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.740]   You are my Lord, but not now.
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.580]   Later."
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:30.620]   When I have more time, when the bills are paid, when my children are older, when I'm
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:35.700]   done with school, when I have more energy, it's usually later.
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:36.700]   It's delayed.
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.900]   See, that's what he's addressing here.
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:44.980]   Disobedience, it'd be very easy to identify when somebody says, "No," because you're standing
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.020]   against God.
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.340]   If you've been raised in the church, you're not going to challenge God.
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.620]   You're smarter than that.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.780]   We don't say no to God, not as Christians.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.380]   We just say, "Later."
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.980]   In the end, later turns into disobedience.
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.900]   If you look at it, remember, you don't need to turn your Bibles there, but remember the
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:10.060]   parable of the talents, where God gives this parable.
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:15.260]   Understand that this is one of the last parables that Jesus gives in his public ministry.
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.100]   He's already visited the temple.
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.260]   He's about to go to the cross.
[00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.100]   He's only a few days away from being crucified.
[00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:26.860]   The last public address that he gives to the multitudes, one of the last parables that
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:31.380]   he gives is a parable of the talent, because he's preparing them for his departure.
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.100]   In that, he gives this parable of the talent, when he says he gave one servant five, and
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.500]   the other one two, and the other one one.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.580]   The one who will receive five, he invests it, and then he multiplies it.
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.380]   He comes back with another five, and he says, "I invested in this and this, and I give you
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.380]   this."
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.220]   The one with the two comes back, and then he says, "I multiply two.
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.660]   You gave me two, and I added the other two, and here it is back."
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:58.500]   The one with the one comes back, and all he did was bury it.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.980]   He buries it, and he comes back, and he gives it to him.
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:06.460]   The response that he gets from his lack of work, I want you to look at this.
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.460]   Matthew 25, 24-30.
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.620]   I'm going to read starting from verse 26.
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:15.740]   He said, "But his master answered him, 'You wicked and slothful servant, you knew that
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:21.340]   I reap where I have not sowed, and gather where I scattered no seed.
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.100]   Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.380]   received what was my own with interest.
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:32.380]   So take the talent from him and give it to him who has ten talents.
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:36.680]   For to everyone who has will more be given and will have an abundance.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.380]   But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.'"
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.300]   So stop right there.
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.500]   So basically, you didn't do your job.
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.740]   I'm going to take what you have.
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.000]   I'm going to give it to the people who were faithful.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.740]   But here's the part, how the end result of this servant.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.860]   "And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness.
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:01.860]   In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.260]   For why?
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.020]   Where is he headed?
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.900]   Where's the weeping and gnashing of teeth?
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.900]   He's talking about hell.
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.000]   He's talking about eternal judgment.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.460]   So according to this parable, because he didn't do his job.
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:24.460]   Now, if we're not careful, we can look at this and say, "You better get to it."
[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:29.060]   Those of you who've been lazy, you're going to go to hell.
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:32.740]   If we're not careful, we can apply this and say, "Well, that's what the parable of the
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.120]   talents teach."
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:40.580]   Because he was lazy and he was slothful, he says there's going to be weeping and gnashing
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.780]   of teeth.
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:48.180]   I think we really need to understand this in context and who this man is.
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:54.460]   Because in verse 26, the reason why he gave, why he didn't do what he did was, he says,
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.180]   again, turn your Bibles, I don't think I have this up here, turn your Bibles to Matthew
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.180]   25.
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.180]   Okay?
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.420]   Go to that parable because I don't think I have the verse up here.
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:14.980]   In Matthew 25, verse 24 to 25, where this servant with the one talent, he gives the
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.860]   reason why he didn't invest.
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:23.140]   And he says, okay, Matthew 25, verse 24, "He also who had received the one talent came
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:27.900]   forward saying, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.140]   and gathering where you scattered no seed.
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.620]   So I was afraid and I went and hid your talent in the ground.
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:38.600]   Here you have what is yours.'"
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:46.060]   So the reason why he gives, why he didn't labor for the kingdom was your fault.
[00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.120]   Because you're an unfair man.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.740]   It is wrong for you to expect me to labor.
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:55.100]   And you are unfair and you're asking me to do something that is unfair, so therefore
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.500]   I didn't do it.
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:01.340]   So the description of this man is an unbeliever.
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:06.140]   He said the reason for his slothfulness, the reason for his laziness was because he didn't
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.700]   believe his master.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.300]   So this is not a distinction between a Christian who is working hard and a Christian who didn't
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.300]   work hard enough.
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:21.860]   He's talking about an individual who because of his unbelief, it led to his slothfulness.
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:27.820]   How much of our Christian life is the way it is because we do not believe?
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.540]   That we don't say no just in case.
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:35.120]   We definitely want insurance because justification by faith and faith alone, so we want to make
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:39.540]   sure we have enough insurance so that when we die that we're going to go to heaven, but
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:43.580]   the rest of our lives we don't pursue God.
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.580]   We don't worship God.
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.740]   We don't obey God.
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:51.100]   Because all we are concerned about is insurance to get to heaven and the rest of it, I find
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.100]   life somewhere else.
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:58.140]   I want life in heaven when I die, but while I'm here I find life in anything else but
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.140]   God.
[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:03.460]   It's an expression of his unbelief.
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:07.580]   Turn with me again to Hebrews chapter 5.
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.580]   Turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 5.
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:14.180]   Those verses are going to be up behind me, so if you don't have the Bible you can just
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:15.180]   look behind me.
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:20.060]   So if you look at Hebrews chapter 5, here's a passage that a lot of people get confused
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:26.060]   about when we look at Hebrews chapter 6 where it talks about it's impossible in the case
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:29.860]   of those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gifts and have shared
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:33.580]   the Holy Spirit and have tasted the goodness of the Word of God and the powers of the age
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:38.580]   to come and then have fallen away to restore them again to repentance since they are crucifying
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:43.320]   once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:49.420]   So people read that passage in Hebrews chapter 6, 4 through 6 and say, "Well, is he talking
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.500]   about a Christian losing his salvation?"
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:59.460]   Clearly, a one who has been justified by God's elect purpose cannot lose his salvation, so
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.140]   what is he talking about here?
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:06.860]   If you look at the previous verse in Hebrews chapter 5, verse 11 and on, it gives us a
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.500]   context of this.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:13.260]   Again, the most important part of understanding scripture is context.
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:17.060]   So in the context, remember who he's speaking to.
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:23.740]   He's speaking to second or third generation Hebrew Christians where their primary sin
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:28.540]   wasn't necessary that they rejected his blood, that they didn't believe in deity, like all
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:33.460]   of these things are mentioned in Hebrews, but their primary problem was they were just
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.900]   starting to drift back into their old life.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:41.700]   And so the argument that the author is making is the preciousness of Christ.
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.900]   How can you neglect such a great salvation?
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:51.780]   So in other words, how can you just nonchalantly just kind of drift back into your old ways?
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.580]   So look what he says in chapter 5, verse 11.
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:58.540]   He says, "About this we have much to say, and it is hard to explain since you have become
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.060]   dull of hearing."
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:05.220]   That was their primary problem because they became lukewarm and they got tired and they
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:10.620]   got dull of hearing, so they have a lot of teaching in their head, but now they're not
[00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.620]   hearing anymore.
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:12.620]   They're not growing.
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:16.820]   "For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic
[00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.940]   principles of the oracles of God.
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.300]   You need milk, not solid food.
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:26.620]   For everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness since he is a
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:27.940]   child.
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:32.340]   But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment trained
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:37.020]   by constant practice to distinguish good from evil."
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:41.340]   The reason why they became dull of hearing, though they have a lot of teaching in them
[00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:48.060]   or they didn't mature, is because they didn't constantly practice righteousness.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:51.380]   And they were beginning to drift back into their old life.
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:57.020]   It is in that context that Paul, I think it's Paul, but whoever wrote the book of Hebrew,
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:05.500]   is trying to tell the readers that apostasy is not something that they choose, at least
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.060]   not here.
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.020]   Apostasy was happening because they weren't paying attention.
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.900]   They weren't fervent for God.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:15.620]   They were being slothful and their hearts were becoming hardened.
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.920]   And as a result, verse 7 through 8, it says, "For land that has drunk the rain and often
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.540]   falls in it and produces a crop useful for those whose sake it is cultivated receives
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.660]   a blessing from God.
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:32.020]   But after it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed and
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:36.940]   its end is to be burned."
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.180]   You've sat under the teaching.
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.780]   You have every opportunity to grow.
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:40.780]   You had fellowship.
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.680]   You have brothers and sisters around you.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.060]   You had men and women to disciple you.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:49.220]   You had every opportunity to love people, to give, take care of the poor, to live in
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.060]   obedience and you had every opportunity.
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:56.820]   You were taught to do all of this stuff and yet you delayed.
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:01.260]   You were simply slothful and you've always said, "Not now.
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.720]   Maybe in the future.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.340]   Maybe when the kids are older.
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.340]   Maybe when I have more time.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:09.780]   Maybe my job situation is more secure."
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:10.780]   And we always delay.
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:15.460]   And it says, "After you receive all of this and some bear fruit and those who don't bear
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:19.380]   fruit and it's not because you didn't have the opportunity."
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:22.420]   And usually it's not no, it's later.
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:28.380]   See, in both situations, he's not talking about somebody who's outright rebelling against
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:37.380]   God, he's expressing his unbelief through delayed obedience.
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:42.220]   And then the next phrase that he says, the antithesis of that, is not to be slothful
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:48.180]   in our zeal and our passion for God, but he says, "Rather be fervent in spirit, serve
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.180]   the Lord."
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.180]   Be fervent.
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.060]   I want you to understand the language that he uses here.
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.220]   He doesn't just say, "You know what?
[00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:58.020]   Live in obedience and just be passionate about the things of God."
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:02.460]   The word for fervent here literally means to boil.
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.700]   It's a very descriptive word.
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:05.700]   To boil.
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.740]   So when you think of something boiling, it's not somebody who's just checking in and checking
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:10.540]   out of church.
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:14.260]   It's not somebody who just kind of like, "Oh yeah, you know, 15 years ago I accepted Christ
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:18.660]   and I'm not like the pastors or the missionaries.
[00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:22.300]   I'm just an average churchgoer."
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:26.780]   And when somebody, anytime somebody says, "Oh, I'm just an average churchgoer," it's
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:31.020]   kind of like an excuse, like there's different levels of Christianity and it's just some
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:36.220]   pastors and some serious Christians have decided to be boiling for God and for the rest of
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:40.540]   us, not so much.
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:43.740]   That's not a call for a few Christians.
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:50.620]   And it would only make sense that a reasonable response to the blood of Christ would be a
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:58.900]   fervor, a boiling over, because what he called us to is not simply not going to hell.
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:03.940]   The scripture says that he has come to give life and to give this life abundantly.
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:08.580]   So it would only make sense that the blood of Christ that we profess to believe would
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:12.220]   result in a life that is boiling over for God.
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.740]   Fervent, passionate.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.760]   That's why it says in Jeremiah 29, 13, "You will seek me and find me when you seek me
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:23.080]   with all your heart."
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:27.220]   Have we ever wondered why God doesn't seem to be answering our prayers?
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.860]   Why it's so hard to read through scripture?
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.980]   Why the fellowship is not attracting?
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:39.060]   Maybe, maybe we're already fed with the things of this world and there's no appetite for
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.480]   it.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:44.780]   Maybe we spend all our energy and all our fervor and all our might on something else
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:49.800]   and then we bring the leftover to God and wondering why God is not passionately doing
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.640]   what we desire him to be.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:57.160]   He said, "No, you will find me if you seek me with all your heart."
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:01.200]   Do you know that God may be waiting for you to make up your mind whether you're going
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.160]   to follow him or not?
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.960]   Isn't that exactly what Joshua says in 24?
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.480]   He's looking to Israelites who are giving sacrifices, who went through a battle, wandered
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:17.680]   through the desert, and at the end of his life he says, "Make up your mind for me and
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.680]   my household.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.680]   We will serve the Lord."
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.360]   He's not talking to idol worshippers.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:28.240]   He's not talking to people who are chasing after pagan idols.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:34.160]   He's talking about people who are constantly wavering back and forth based upon any trials
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:38.160]   and tribulation and temptation comes into their life and they choose whatever is the
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:42.620]   most convenient for them depending on the circumstance they're in and he says, "Choose.
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:45.340]   Make up your mind."
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:51.320]   That's what it means to be boiling over in the Spirit in serving the Lord, to commit.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.840]   When Jesus was asked, "What is the greatest commandment?" in Mark chapter 12, 30 and 31,
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:59.040]   "Then you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.640]   your mind, and with all your strength."
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:06.120]   You probably heard sermons about what it means to love the Lord with your heart, with your
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.520]   mind, with your strength, and with your mind.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.480]   And all of these things are true.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:15.600]   But the emphasis in these verses is not your mind, heart, strength.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.880]   The emphasis is all.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:23.040]   To love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, with
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.560]   all your strength.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:30.000]   Because God gave all to us through his Son.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.160]   And so what he desires from us is worship.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:38.000]   And worship by definition requires a boiling over.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.280]   You guys watch the Super Bowl game.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:44.280]   And you know, I was rooting for the Eagles, right?
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.160]   And I was rooting for the Eagles because we used to live there a long time ago.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.520]   We had about three, four years that we were in Philadelphia.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:52.880]   So if I were going to choose any team, it would have been the Eagles.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.320]   And then I found out that there are a lot of Christians there.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.640]   I saw them praying before and then they were praying after and they're giving testimony.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.600]   It's like, of course, they're brothers.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.600]   We're related.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.600]   So I have to root for them, right?
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.440]   So some of you guys may have watched the football and I heard some of you guys saying, "Oh,
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.440]   who do you root for?"
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.000]   It's like, I don't know, but I hate the Patriots, right?
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.120]   So you were rooting against the Patriots, not necessarily for the Eagles.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.780]   So you had various reasons.
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:24.280]   So when they won, you know, different people celebrated differently, right?
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:31.080]   And I was happy, but I wasn't elated because I didn't really follow football and I don't
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.080]   have a jersey.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.560]   So I kind of watched it and I said, "Oh, I'm going to choose the Eagles because it
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.560]   just makes sense to me."
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:42.440]   And some of you guys were passionate about it, like really passionate about it, right?
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:48.080]   And the different levels of passion is related to how much time you devoted to watching the
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:52.680]   game and following the team and what kind of connection do you have and how much devotion
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.680]   you had.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.440]   And so some of you have been fans for over a decade, maybe longer than that, and you've
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.560]   been watching and Eagles never won a game.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.680]   So you went through the ups and downs, went to the Super Bowl and didn't win.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.080]   So you went through all that drama.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.280]   You invested so much in that.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.600]   So when they finally won, you say, "Yes!
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.600]   We won!"
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:15.880]   So, you know, we all celebrated, but we had different degrees of celebration, right?
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:20.440]   But all of it was a genuine response of worship, right?
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.480]   A genuine response of worship.
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:31.920]   Our devotion to God, our devotion to God must reflect what He has done.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.520]   Our devotion to God, it has to.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:44.600]   It only makes sense that if what we are celebrating is a sacrifice of His only begotten Son, He
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:48.640]   who knew no sin became sin, that we may experience the righteousness of God.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.620]   And that is what we are celebrating.
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.520]   That is what we are worshiping.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:58.080]   That what we do and how we do must reflect that intensity.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:04.440]   So it only makes sense that God requires not checking in and checking out, not reading
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:09.680]   up Scripture, not to say, "Oh, I prayed five minutes or ten minutes," but a boiling over
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:12.520]   in the Holy Spirit.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.520]   A boiling over.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.640]   That's what He wants, and that's what He deserves, and that's the only reasonable response when
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:21.280]   we truly understand what it is that we are worshiping.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:28.040]   John 2.17, John the Baptist says, "His disciples remembered that it was written, 'Zeal for
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.120]   your house will consume me.'"
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.440]   He's referring to Jesus at the temple.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.960]   The disciples saw Jesus gentle.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.720]   See, young children come and say, "Hey, don't block them from coming."
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.240]   He was so gentle with them.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:46.280]   He had prostitutes coming and begging for forgiveness, and He was so gracious and loving.
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:50.360]   Glass collectors that everybody wanted killed.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:53.840]   They wanted to pick up stones and just kill them, and the Jewish community would have
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.480]   just dragged them out on the street and just left them alone.
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.440]   But Jesus makes them His disciples.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:02.840]   He was probably the most gentle, gracious man that they've ever met, and yet when He
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:07.480]   goes to the temple, not only that He's flipped over tables, He's actually making whip, and
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.920]   He's starting whipping people out of His temple.
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.080]   It was a scene they probably weren't used to seeing of Jesus.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:20.560]   It was afterwards, as they were meditating and thinking, the disciples quote a prophecy
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:29.120]   about His Son, and they remembered, it says, that "Zeal for your house will consume Him."
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.460]   Consume Him.
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:39.040]   If we are the body of Christ, and He is the head, and the Scripture says that He is consumed
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.760]   for His house, it only makes sense.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:50.840]   He says, "Do not be slothful in zeal, but be consumed to be filled, to be passionate,
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:55.520]   to boil over in the Spirit in serving the Lord."
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:00.120]   That our Christianity is not just something that we do.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:04.240]   That the love that we practice, the grace that we are under, is not just something that
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.240]   we do.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.240]   I'm a father.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.240]   I'm a son.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.240]   I'm a friend.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.480]   I'm a pastor.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.440]   And I have all these identities.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:17.120]   And a child of God is not just one of them.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:21.420]   A worshiper of God is not just one of many identities.
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.600]   That is who I am.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:27.240]   And everything else is consumed under that.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:35.000]   To boil over, there's nothing more important than a reasonable response to God.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.960]   Benjamin Franklin, who many historians say he was not a Christian, and I don't think
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:49.520]   there's any debate over that, and a lot of his helpers watched him attend George Whitefield's
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:50.520]   revivals.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:56.840]   And they asked him, "You're not a believer, but why do you keep going to his rallies?"
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:01.720]   And his response, he confessed that he often went to hear George Whitefield because he
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:06.320]   could watch him burn before his very eyes.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:11.240]   Whether Benjamin Franklin believed it or not, he knew that George Whitefield did.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:16.400]   And he was attracted to a man who absolutely believed what he was preaching, even if he
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.760]   didn't believe it.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.960]   I was thinking about Apostle Paul's ministry.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.320]   You know, I've been in ministry, I started when I was 20.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.920]   I probably started earlier than I should have, but I've been in ministry about 30 years.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.600]   And I was thinking about Apostle Paul's ministry.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.600]   He came to Christ when he was about 30 years old.
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:38.760]   He, obviously, he evangelized and he did various things, but his official ministry didn't start.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.560]   This three missionary journeys in the Book of Acts doesn't start until he's about 42
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.560]   years old.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:46.960]   There's about a 12-year gap before he's a Christian, and then he actually begins to
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.560]   do official ministry, where he's sent out by the Church of Antioch.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.700]   He is martyred at the age of 61.
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:56.320]   At the end of his third missionary journey, he goes to Rome and he gets carried out.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:00.240]   Eventually he is jailed, and then he is beheaded and he dies.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:06.680]   So his active ministry, official ministry, lasted 19 years.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:17.040]   19 years this man traveled over continents, not cities, continents, between Jerusalem
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:22.120]   to Turkey to Rome, three times around.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.440]   And even when he was sitting in prison, he's writing letters to make sure that he makes
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.680]   the most of his time.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.080]   You talk about a man consumed by the things of God.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.240]   This man was consumed in 19 years.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:39.080]   And I keep thinking about, I've been in ministry for 30 years, and sometimes it's tiring.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:43.000]   I think about Apostle Paul, like, wow, he did this in 19 years.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.320]   All the churches that he established.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.900]   Everywhere he preached, everywhere he went, this was a man who was consumed by the things
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.120]   of God.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:58.560]   So when he writes these words to boil over in the Spirit, I mean, that's him.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.560]   That's Apostle Paul.
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:06.520]   You know, this week, myself and Pastor Mark and Pastor Nate, we were at a Steve Lawson's
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.720]   Expositors Conference.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:15.400]   Basically it was like a room full of pastors, about a small group, about 50 of us.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:20.160]   And Steve Lawson started out the half day on Monday, and then all day Tuesday, and then
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.520]   half day on Wednesday.
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:29.480]   So he gave probably a total of maybe about, I think about 10 messages in those two days,
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.760]   two full days, if you count it.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.480]   And the whole time, I was thinking, there's nothing that necessarily he said was brand
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.920]   new to me.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:45.920]   But I just couldn't get the thought out of my mind that this 67-year-old man was standing
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:51.240]   there for six, seven hours straight, teaching the Word of God.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.720]   And he revealed to us his preaching schedule.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:57.640]   And he said he was on the road for eight months, traveling all over the world.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:02.480]   And the whole time I'm thinking how time was just go to India.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.160]   People keep asking me, "Are you over it yet?
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.160]   Are you over it yet?"
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.920]   It's like, "No, I need a couple more months."
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:13.840]   And I keep thinking, "Man, this guy is 67 years old, and sometimes he's preaching 20,
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:19.360]   30 hours a week."
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.200]   And the whole time I was thinking, "How is this guy doing this?"
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.920]   At 67, you think, "Just relax.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.920]   Write some books."
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.080]   You know what I mean?
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:36.600]   And the whole time I just kept on thinking, "This guy is being spent for God's kingdom.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.600]   He's being spent."
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:42.440]   It's almost like he's trying to die on the pulpit.
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:47.200]   I was just not necessarily what he said, just watching him at work.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:51.200]   And then he said he's an introvert, and it's like, "Can you be an introvert and do what
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.800]   you're doing?"
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.440]   And then in between the breaks, he would sit there and he said he loves football.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:58.440]   He was a jock.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.880]   And then he said, "I know what happened, the Super Bowl, and I loved it, and I watched
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:02.880]   the game."
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.520]   And I think he said he was rooting for the Eagles.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.200]   But he said, "In between break, don't ask me about that.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.480]   We're only here for two days.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.320]   So I would love to talk to you about that, but we only have short time.
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.320]   So when you come, ask me about ministry.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.320]   Ask me about sermons.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.320]   Ask me about what I said.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.480]   So I want to engage you."
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.060]   So that's exactly what he did.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.200]   Every break we had.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:27.320]   I couldn't even say hi to him because he was always talking to people, and I didn't want
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.560]   to be that guy.
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:34.400]   So I was just like, "Okay, he's busy enough as it is."
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:41.160]   But the whole time I was just thinking and just challenged, not necessarily what he said,
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.440]   what he's doing.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.920]   He's being spent.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.280]   He's boiling over for God.
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:55.720]   Again, for me as a younger pastor, it was challenging to me just to be in that.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:02.760]   Jonathan Edwards is a guy that I think most Americans and even outside of America will
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:08.080]   believe that probably the greatest theologian that modern Christianity has produced.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:15.040]   As a young man, he said he was resolved to live with all my might while I do live.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:19.720]   Resolved never to lose one moment of time, but improve it the most profitable way that
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.440]   I possibly can.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.720]   Resolved to ask myself at the end of every day, week, month, and year, wherein I could
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:30.600]   possibly in any respect have done better.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:37.600]   The temptation for us is to be casual because we're in Orange County.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:46.320]   We can worship God, church, give, fellowship, all without any sacrifice.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.160]   All without any sacrifice.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:56.000]   We can choose an easy road that is broad and not narrow and still be in the church, still
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.280]   be active, still be giving.
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:04.600]   So our temptation is to be lackadaisical.
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:08.120]   Is to just be nonchalant in our walk with God.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.960]   We worship, no sense of urgency.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.600]   We pray, which is something that we need to do.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:16.520]   We study the Bible, but it's not something that we must do.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.960]   It's just something that's good if you did do it.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:22.600]   See, in Ecclesiastes 9.10, and let me conclude with this.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:27.720]   He said, "Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:33.960]   For there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol to which you are going."
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.120]   Our life is short.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:39.360]   And you'll hear that over and over again, and probably you already feel that.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:40.360]   Our life is short.
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:41.360]   We're like a mist.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:45.720]   And the psalmist says, "Help me, Lord, to count my days."
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:46.720]   Why does he say that?
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.560]   It's not because he's morbid.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.160]   It's not because he likes thinking about his death.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:56.800]   It's so that he can recognize that the time that we have is short, that I would use it
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:02.720]   wisely to pursue and invest in things that have eternal value.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.480]   Not things that you're going to enjoy for the moment, and then a year later look back
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.280]   and say, "Wow, that was a waste."
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:13.200]   But to be consumed with the things of God.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:18.040]   To give to Him not just some, but all of it.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:22.600]   If you don't understand who God is, you may listen to that and say, "Wow, what a burden.
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:24.080]   What a burden.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.080]   Life is hard enough as it is."
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.720]   And we come to church and you say, "You're not doing enough.
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.360]   Do more."
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:36.040]   You can easily hear that if you don't know who He is.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:40.280]   Scripture says that He has come to give life and to give this life abundantly.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:44.200]   The life He's describing there, Zoe, is about joy.
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.200]   It's about life.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.840]   It's about Sabbath that was lost at the fall.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:53.880]   And the whole purpose of salvation is to restore that Sabbath, to give us this rest.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:58.920]   And so the challenge to be fervent and to be passionate and to be boiling over, it is
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.720]   not a challenge for difficulty.
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.960]   It is an invitation to live.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:10.560]   Because real life is found at the center of His will.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.560]   Real joy.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.560]   Not this fake joy that you experience for a moment and then have to repeat it over and
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.160]   over again.
[00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.680]   Not this you travel one time and you come back longing to do more and you have to do
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.000]   over and over again.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.460]   He says, "The water I give you will well up into eternal life and he who drinks of
[00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:27.560]   it will never thirst.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.640]   The bread that you eat, you will eat and you will be hungry again.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:35.260]   But the bread that I give you will well up in you eternal life."
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:41.840]   So the challenge that He has to not to be slothful in zeal, but to boil over in the
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:46.960]   Holy Spirit in serving the Lord is an invitation to live.
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:51.280]   To really live in Christ.
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:57.920]   I pray that our Lord would open our eyes and give us faith to see who He really is.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:03.400]   That the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ that we had a glimpse of would continue to
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.080]   be opened.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:08.560]   That He would draw people to Himself.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:13.520]   Come to me all who are weary and heavy laden and find rest in Christ.
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:17.640]   Would you take a minute to pray with me again as we ask our worship team to come and lead
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:18.960]   us?
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.400]   Again, take some time to pray.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.680]   You don't have to be articulate.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:28.680]   You don't have to be, have to have long theological prayers.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:32.000]   Just be honest even if it is a short prayer.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.600]   I believe, help my unbelief.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:39.640]   Have you been delaying your obedience?
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:45.960]   Have you just been nonchalantly walking and drifting toward the world?
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:50.620]   Hear the voice of God inviting you to His presence.
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:54.160]   To live, to really live.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:59.200]   What have you been holding on to that's preventing you from this life?
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.000]   Ask the Lord for His help.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.280]   Again, as our worship team leads us, let's take some time in honest prayer.
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.120]   >> Thank you.
