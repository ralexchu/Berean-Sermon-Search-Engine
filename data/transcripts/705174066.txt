[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720]   Hi, Church family.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.000]   My name is John Chin.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.720]   I'm a grad student, and it's a privilege to share my testimony with you today.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.900]   I grew up in a Christian household.
[00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.120]   I called myself a Christian and attended church, but did not have a relationship with God.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.240]   Understand the gospel or read the Bible.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.560]   I wanted to get good grades, get into a good college, and be successful by the world's
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.160]   standards.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.320]   My junior year of high school, I worked too hard, experienced burnout, and had to drop
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.200]   my classes.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.120]   Throughout my struggle, I did not really think of God or turn to Him.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.000]   I was just trying to make sense of what was going on and stabilize.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.440]   I transferred schools, repeated my junior year, and did well at the new school.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.440]   I was extremely thankful to God for healing me and helping me to recover.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.760]   However, my relationship with God was based primarily on experience rather than belief
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.240]   in the gospel.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.000]   My real growth in the knowledge of the gospel started in college.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.600]   I started focusing on Christ.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.480]   I attended worship services, Bible studies, and served in various capacities.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.320]   However, I didn't read the Bible consistently.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.600]   I absorbed lots of teaching about the Bible and grew closer to God, but I still desired
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.760]   the things of this worldâ€”success, wealth, comfort.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.880]   I don't recall a specific moment when I received Christ, but I'll share what I came to believe.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.040]   I believe in the gospel, that there is a God and He is holy, righteous, and good, that
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.320]   all mankind have sinned, fall short of God's perfect standard, and deserve eternal condemnation.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.400]   But God, in love and mercy, sent His Son Jesus Christ for us.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.840]   Jesus lived a perfect life, died for our sins, and rose from the dead to prove that He was
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.400]   the Son of God.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.720]   Jesus took the sin that was ours, and in faith we receive His righteousness.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.600]   And so our response should be to turn away from sin and turn towards Christ.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.440]   Next, I'll share when I was convicted of my sin and requested forgiveness.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.320]   I struggle with lust, and recently I had another relapse.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.320]   I felt guilty for sinning and frustrated that the struggle with lust is so hard.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.960]   I also felt separated from God.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.920]   In that moment, and others like it, I was convicted of how deep my sin is.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.200]   I am a sinner to the core, in need of God's love, grace, and mercy.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.760]   Afterwards, I prayed to God and asked for forgiveness.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.400]   I asked God to help me repent, turn away from sin, and turn towards Him.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.480]   I remembered that Christ died for my sins, and that by His blood I am forgiven.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.560]   I still struggle with lust, but rather than living in sin, I seek to struggle with sin.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.640]   Since I came to Berean, I have continued to grow closer to Christ.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.360]   I learned how to do inductive Bible study, which has been helpful in reading the Word
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.160]   on my own.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.800]   I have had fruitful times reading the Word where I have been challenged and encouraged.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.000]   I noticed interesting observations and came up with questions that I kept in the back
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.800]   of my mind.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.960]   One of those questions is what it means to fear the Lord, and although I have a better
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.900]   understanding of that now, I look forward to learning more.
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.960]   I still desire the things of this world, but the more I love Christ, the less I care about
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.000]   worldly things.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.200]   In closing, I am grateful for how God has worked in my life, and I seek to run the race
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.680]   faithfully and with endurance.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.680]   Thank you.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.680]   [Applause]
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:51.620]   (applause)
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.540]   (speaking faintly)
[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.540]   of the water. (speaking faintly)
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.540]  , and we're gonna do that in the next step. (speaking faintly)
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:22.060]   Now, if I could get a clap, and a song.
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.860]   (child speaking faintly)
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.040]   (audience applauding)
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.980]   [APPLAUSE]
