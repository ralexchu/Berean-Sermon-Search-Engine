[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   The freedom that you've given us, that we would use it, Lord,
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.880]   vigorously to grow and to mature and to be good stewards of everything that you've given us.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.680]   So we pray that you bless us, that you would guide us,
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.080]   that your Holy Spirit would empower us in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.520]   Okay. So, today we're looking at Acts chapter 1 through 17,
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.160]   and I know there's quite a few people who were not with us
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.560]   in the first two sections of the study of the Book of Acts.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.040]   So what we're going to do is, in order for all of us to be on the same page,
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.800]   or at least for those of you who weren't here for the study of the first part,
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.760]   that you are not going to fall behind. So this is actually the third part of
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.040]   three-part study in the Book of Acts. We did the first part a while ago,
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.480]   and we're doing chapters 18 through 28 for this section. Okay.
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.200]   But before we get into that, we want to make sure that we're all on the same page.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.040]   So what I want to do is I want to take some time to review,
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.560]   okay, review over the Book of Acts and what we've learned,
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.040]   and then starting from next week, we'll jump into chapter 18. Okay.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.240]   So today is going to be reviewed. So if you weren't here with us for the first
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.760]   couple times that we did it, it'd be a good day for us to for you to catch up.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.360]   I don't have any handouts for you today, but we are going to have group
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.120]   opportunities for us to do this together. So Acts, this has an introduction.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.320]   What is the main verse that outlines the structure of this book?
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.680]   Acts 1-8. Okay. So the Book of Acts is one of those books that is outlined,
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.800]   and it follows that outline to the T. We can pinpoint at what point does the gospel go from
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.280]   Jerusalem to Judea to Samaria to the remotest part of the world. It is divided very neatly that way.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.680]   So once you understand that, Acts 1-8 is the outline of the Book of Acts.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.400]   So if we say chapter 7, what part are we in? Are we in Judea, Samaria?
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.120]   Are we in chapter 28, what part are we in? So you'll have a clear view of where we are in the
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.920]   Book of Acts. Okay. So Acts 1-8 is an extremely important verse, and I encourage you, if you
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.200]   have not memorized that verse, to memorize that verse because that will give you, not only is it
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.120]   in and of itself a powerful verse, but it gives us an outline of what we are studying. Okay.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.840]   Acts 1-8. Which apostle is called to lead among the Jewish church, and which one was called to
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:52.320]   bring the gospel to the Gentiles? Peter and Paul. So you can kind of outline where Peter steps in
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:00.720]   and where Paul steps in, right? In the Book of Acts, where the ministry is, when the primary
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:08.800]   focus of the gospel ministry is for the Jews, Peter is the primary character, right? He's the
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.640]   one up in the front, he's the one giving the speeches, he's the one being persecuted and being
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.600]   sent to prison, okay? But once we move to the work of the Gentiles, Apostle Paul takes over,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.720]   Peter is not even mentioned anymore. Okay. So those are the two main human characters,
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.800]   the apostle to the Gentiles and then the apostle to the Jews. Sorry, I got that backwards. Apostle
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.480]   to the Jews and then apostle to the Gentiles. Okay. So, but in reality, those two people,
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.680]   even though they may be the main characters, they're just the people that the Holy Spirit uses
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.880]   to bring the gospel forward. So the real main character is who?
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.280]   Those of you who were with us from the beginning, who's the main character?
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.400]   The Holy Spirit, right? So the Holy Spirit is the main character behind. So if you are starting
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:08.000]   with the book of Acts, what I want to encourage you to do is to circle every time you see the
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.800]   word Holy Spirit in the book of Acts. Okay. I'm not going to tell you exactly how many times that
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.400]   word Holy Spirit is mentioned, but the Holy Spirit is mentioned all throughout the book of Acts and
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.600]   you can't read anything that happens in the book of Acts without the mention of how the Holy Spirit
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.720]   moved them, how the Holy Spirit empowered them. So again, even though we will study Paul, we'll
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.880]   study Peter, the main character behind them is always the word of the Holy Spirit. That's really
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.480]   the theme of the whole book of Acts, how the Holy Spirit empowers people to do his work, his way.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:49.120]   What makes the period of the Acts really unique, unlike any other period in the Church's
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.400]   history? It's extremely important that we understand this or else you have bad,
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.680]   bad hermeneutics. This is where bad application, bad understanding of the movement of the Holy
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.800]   Spirit, the Church, a lot of it comes from the book of Acts. One of the fundamental principles
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.000]   of hermeneutics and how to understand and apply the scripture is how to interpret,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.080]   how not to interpret narratives, right? So what makes this period of when the book of Acts is
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:35.760]   written unique? What makes it unique? Okay, we still have the apostles,
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:43.920]   which we don't have today. That's unique during that period. The period of the apostles,
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.800]   so we're going to be doing things in group activities, so we need everybody to sit down.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:59.040]   You can bring your dinner, you can have your dinner, okay? But this is the format. Okay, let me
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:06.320]   reiterate for those of you who came late, we're reviewing the first 17 chapters that we studied
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.400]   and we're going to start from chapter 18 is going to start from next time, okay? So this is kind of
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.760]   get everybody caught up so that you're not lost even though you jumped in for this one. How many
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:24.640]   of you are coming to this class for the first time? You weren't here for the last two. Okay,
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.480]   so there's about a third of you. All right, so anyway, that's what we're doing today, okay? And
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.000]   from now on, this is going to be the format, so please don't sit on the side and if we need more
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.080]   tables, we'll set up more tables because I want you guys to interact with the groups, the smaller
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:48.400]   groups, okay? Okay, sit on this side.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:07:06.320]   All right, and another thing is we're going to try to start at seven o'clock as close to that
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:12.160]   as possible. So don't make, if you're in a habit of like, well, seven, we'll get in there, seven,
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.680]   ten, seven, fifteen, you're going to miss 15 minutes of Bible study. We're going to start at
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.120]   seven o'clock. I think it's only fair to do that because people who show up at seven o'clock have
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.400]   to wait 10-15 minutes, so I think it's only fair to start at seven o'clock. So try to come
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:32.480]   6.55 if you can, okay? So we're going to do our best to try to start at seven o'clock, okay?
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.600]   So that we can finish, when I say we're going to finish, about 8, 10, and 15,
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.640]   so that we will hopefully not go over that unless we absolutely have to, okay?
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:50.800]   All right, so the Book of Acts, the reason, another reason why it's, it's period is,
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:58.160]   that's important is because it's in between two covenants, right? We have the old covenant and
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:04.880]   we have people who met Christ and yet they didn't, they weren't baptized, right? So they were under
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.360]   the old covenant and now the Holy Spirit has come, they heard about it, but they're kind of in
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:15.520]   transition between the covenants. So that's a period that is unique to the Book of Acts that
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.640]   is not repeated in the church history, so we will, we have never experienced that ever after that,
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.200]   okay? So that makes it unique. So the reason why all of this is important, we're studying the Book
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:31.200]   of Acts and we're not studying it to say, you know what, Paul performed miracles, so that's what we
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.920]   should be doing today, you know? I mean, they got baptized by the Holy Spirit later on after they
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:41.040]   met Christ, maybe that's what happens today too. So we have to be careful that we're not applying
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:46.080]   the things that we are learning in the Book of Acts in that direct manner because it's a narrative,
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:52.960]   right? And it is unique to what happened to the early church, okay? So again, so we're studying,
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.720]   so we're studying principles that are taught and we apply principles, but we can't pull from them,
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.360]   just like, you know, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, they went into the fire, they didn't
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:10.000]   get burned, so that means if I'm faithful, I will never get burned, right? You would never apply it
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.080]   like that because you know that that's a narrative, it just tells us what happened, it is not, these
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.720]   are not instructions to teach us what we ought to do. So we have to be careful when we're studying
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.920]   the Book of Acts that you don't get major doctrines from what you study and say, "This is what happens,
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.360]   so therefore this is what we are supposed to do," okay? So we don't study the Book of Narratives
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.920]   that way, so we have to make sure that when we're studying the Book of Acts that that is the
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.520]   foundation on which we build and study. Why is the study of the Book of Acts so important?
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:45.760]   It reveals God's sovereign hands in the establishment of the church and the spread of the Gospel.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.240]   Jane, can you sit with me? I'm going to have to break this habit.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:10:00.880]   It shows how the Holy Spirit was a vital instrument in the empowering and spreading of the Gospel.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:11.120]   And again, 41 times in 40 verses, the word Holy Spirit is mentioned, I guess,
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.520]   so I mentioned that that is his theme. It provides background information for the letters of the
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:22.640]   Apostles. So if you're reading Thessalonians or if you're reading Corinthians, you know,
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:28.080]   it'll give you some insight as to why he wrote that letter and what are some of the details,
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:33.120]   like Philippi, right? We mentioned that last time we were there. What is one thing that is mentioned
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:40.000]   about the Book of Philippi that is unique to that particular city because what we learned about that
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:50.240]   city? It mentioned something in the letter of Philippi. It was a Roman colony. What were they
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:57.120]   proud of? That they're Roman citizens, right? But that was their source of pride and that's why Paul
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.920]   emphasizes to them that our citizenship is not here but up in heaven because that's what they
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.560]   were bragging about. So those kind of things are insights that you'll get as you study the
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.880]   background of the different cities that you may have missed just doing quite a time on your own,
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:18.960]   but again, that's why it's important. And ultimately, it is a history of our personal faith.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:27.600]   We're not just studying a historical document. This is very personal. This is how we came. We
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.320]   came about. This is how we got the gospel. You know, when Apostle Paul is afflicted and he's
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:37.680]   dragged to prison, stoned and mistruth, all of that, those things are the things that God allowed
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.640]   in order for us to have the gospel, right? This is not just something that we're learning, you know,
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:48.160]   3,000 years ago that's completely detached. Without their suffering, we wouldn't be here,
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.440]   right? Ultimately, God's the one who's behind it, but it's through their suffering, not just them,
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:59.440]   but for 2,000 years of people persevering and walking in faith and having the courage to preach
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.480]   the gospel led us to where we are today. So, the study of the book of Acts is the beginning of that.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:10.240]   So, we ought to study it. Again, if we are detached and again, if we don't have a personal
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.280]   walk with God, anything that we study in the book of Acts or anything that we study in the Bible,
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.600]   you're just studying history. You're just studying theology. So, if you happen to be one of those
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:25.760]   people who like history, you might be interested, but if that's not the case and you're not walking
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.440]   with God, studying the Bible is very laborious. You're studying documents. I mean, you think,
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.920]   "I did that back in college. Why do I need to do this again?" Right? So, it's extremely
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.800]   important for us to understand that this is a study of our personal history.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:48.080]   All right. Just ignore that we're having a lot of problems. We're in the middle of fixing it.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.160]   We had a problem starting next week. Please sit on the tables out on the sides.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.000]   Because we're having, we're going to start, from now on, we're going to be having group stuff.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:06.240]   So, I set up about six or seven per table. Okay? So, I'm trying not to have more than seven per
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:17.360]   table. If we need more, we'll set up more tables. All right. So, the author of the book, the gospel
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:26.160]   of Luke, ends with the ascension of Jesus, and then Acts begins with the ascension of Jesus.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:32.000]   Okay. So, these two books are connected. It really should have been one book, right? But the reason
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.280]   why they didn't connect Luke and Acts together is because John, you know, they had a choice of
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.320]   either putting John in the front of the gospels or at the end of the gospels, but I think they
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.680]   thought it was inappropriate to put John at the end because the three synoptic gospels, you know,
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:53.600]   belong together and Matthew would have been the most logical choice of putting that up front
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:59.600]   because Matthew's gospel is the gospel that connects Jesus to the fulfillment of the Messiah,
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:05.920]   the prophecy of the Messiah, right? So, Matthew would have continued basically the fulfillment
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.480]   of what God said through the prophets in the Old Testament. So, they chose to put Matthew in the
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:16.080]   front. Therefore, in order to put, you know, in order to put that in the front, they had to put
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:21.520]   John in the back, right? But in reality, if you study the book of Luke, it really should have been
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:29.040]   together, Luke and Acts, because this was a written account of Jesus, the book of Luke, and Acts is a
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.360]   written account of what happened after Luke by the same guy for the same person, theophilus.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:44.800]   All right. So, this is a broad outline. Again, if you weren't with us in the study of the book
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:50.960]   of Acts for the first two parts, this is kind of give you an idea. The book of Acts is very neatly
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:58.480]   divided, right? Acts 1-8 tells us, "You will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.440]   you and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, the remotest part of the world."
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.500]   (itting)
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.680]   (dinging)
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.540]   (dinging)
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:21.880]   (dinging)
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.040]   (dinging)
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.200]   (dinging)
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.360]   (dinging)
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.520]   (dinging)
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.680]   (dinging)
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.840]   (dinging)
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:39.860]   - Alright, so, first, the major division of the book
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:45.320]   happens at chapter 12.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.480]   So chapter one through 12 is mainly the work with who?
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.560]   (pause)
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.560]   Peter with the Jews, right?
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.280]   So the gospel, not that the Gentiles are not here
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.400]   in the gospel, but the main part of the works
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.360]   is for the Jews, right?
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.480]   In the New Testament.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.840]   And then starting from chapter 13,
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.840]   what happens in chapter 13?
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.640]   That takes us to the end of the book.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:15.840]   Switches to Paul, and his three missionary journeys begin,
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.000]   right, his first missionary journey begins.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.400]   If you can sit on the table, yeah.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.160]   Right here, there's two men.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:36.440]   So starting from 13 to 28 is the gospel
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.480]   going out to the Gentiles.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.880]   So if you think of it in a broad perspective,
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.720]   chapter one through 12 is to the Jews,
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.720]   in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.800]   And then chapter 13, there is a deliberate mission work
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.680]   that is started in chapter 13,
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.160]   and it takes us to chapter 28.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.400]   Now, all of it is not mission work.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.880]   The end part of it is Paul being captured in Rome,
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.160]   and then he spends a big chunk of it in prison.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.760]   That's the first missionary in prison.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.160]   But 13 through 28 mainly is work being done
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.320]   outside of the Jewish community.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.320]   So chapter one through 12 is to the Jews,
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.880]   13 through 28 to the Gentiles.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.200]   That's the broad break.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.480]   So within the first 12 chapters,
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.080]   chapter seven can go either way because it's transition,
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.200]   but chapter one through seven is primarily work in Jerusalem.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.280]   Primarily, it's not exclusive, primarily in Jerusalem.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.000]   Then chapter eight through 12,
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.840]   what happens in chapter seven and eight
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:39.160]   that propels them to go to the Israel?
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.280]   Persecution, right?
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.160]   So persecution breaks out, people begin to spread out,
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.560]   and the first place they go to is Samaria, right?
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.160]   And the gospel begins to go out as a result of that.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.560]   So chapter eight through 12 is the gospel
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.800]   beginning to go outside of Jerusalem,
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.320]   and then when we get to chapter 13,
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:00.600]   it's a deliberate planned act to go to the Gentiles, right?
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.160]   So that's the broad outline.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.920]   So Apostle Peter is the main character,
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.840]   first 12 chapters, and Apostle Paul on.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.960]   Jewish evangelism, the first seven chapters,
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.120]   and then transition to Judea and Samaria, right?
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.000]   So Jews who are outside of Jerusalem,
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.680]   and then Gentile evangelism.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.080]   You don't need to worry too much about the dates.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.680]   All done in the power of the Holy Spirit, Acts 1.8.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.240]   So that's the general outline.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.320]   So this kind of gives you a picture of what's happening.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:38.080]   It begins in Jerusalem, and the persecution begins,
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.240]   and it begins to spread to Samaria, right?
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.120]   And then we'll see, starting from chapter eight, nine,
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.920]   and 10, the gospel just kind of spreading out.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.760]   This way.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:54.640]   And then, chapter 13 and on,
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.880]   is Antioch is here, and you'll see the gospel
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.240]   begin to spread this way, this area.
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.000]   That's the first missionary journey.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.800]   Second missionary journey comes all the way up this way.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.160]   And then third missionary journey
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.200]   will go even further out like that, okay?
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.800]   So that's kind of like the outline
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.560]   of how the gospel is being spread.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.680]   And this is just a kind of a recap.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.360]   Remember when the Holy Spirit comes at the Pentecost,
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.680]   the people who were there to listen,
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.040]   and they were all amazed because they were able to hear
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.560]   them speaking in tongues in their own language?
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.720]   And these are all the different peoples that are mentioned,
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.920]   and I put 'em in different color
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.800]   because each color represents a different region.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.680]   So, again, this was not planned.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.440]   This was not, they say, let's have everybody
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.600]   from all over the world come and be there for the Pentecost.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.920]   This was all God's doing, right?
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.000]   And so when the Pentecost happens
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.240]   and the church is inaugurated,
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.920]   the first Christians are people from all over.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.400]   So each group of people from Mesopotamia,
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.480]   from Cappadocia and Pontus in Asia,
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.320]   Libya and Cyrene from down here.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.360]   And so it's basically north, south, east, and west.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.120]   And when the persecution happens,
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.120]   these people begin to spread out.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.480]   They're all in different places.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.440]   So by the time the persecution happens
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.760]   and the gospel goes out from Jerusalem to Judea and Samaria,
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.760]   God already has them prepared
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.960]   because these people are running
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.680]   and they're preaching the gospel to their hometowns, right?
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.320]   So that's what happens at the Pentecost.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.160]   So this just gives you a broad outline
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.600]   of what we've been studying and what we're going to.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.360]   And then today, what I want you guys to do,
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.240]   and this is the reason why I'm having you sit in your groups,
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.800]   is we have 38 different events
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.320]   that they're not in chronological order,
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.800]   at least not in this one.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.840]   What I want you to do is go back
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.840]   and on your paper, outline this way,
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:55.360]   Book of Acts, Acts 1-8, Chapter 1-7, 8-12, 13-20.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.360]   Well, it'd be 13-17 because that's where we stopped, okay?
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.880]   So I want you to outline those three things
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:06.880]   and then go back here in your groups that you have.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.360]   After you divide it into three parts,
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.800]   put down which of them belong to which part, okay?
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.880]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.840]   So, and I want you guys to do this as a group project,
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.780]   do it together, and try to figure out,
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.080]   did this happen in Jerusalem?
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.440]   Did this happen today at Samaria?
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.400]   Did this happen in Paul's first
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.920]   or second missionary journey?
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.160]   Put it on that paper first,
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.480]   and then I'll have a second part to that after you finish.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.400]   Okay?
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.760]   So I gave you two pens, so you don't have to fly it over.
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.440]   We're just gonna write it down
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.720]   since that's usually a problem, okay?
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.280]   Just take these 38 events and break it down
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.120]   into different happenings.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.280]   (audience chattering)
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.440]   (audience chattering)
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:22:13.000]   And please don't just write number one,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.960]   number two, number four.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.960]   Just write it out.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.120]   (audience chattering)
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.680]   If you wanna put it in order,
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.080]   I'm gonna have you put it in order eventually.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.240]   (audience chattering)
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.400]   (audience chattering)
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.560]   (audience chattering)
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.720]   (audience chattering)
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.880]   (audience chattering)
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.040]   (audience chattering)
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.200]   (audience chattering)
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.360]   (audience chattering)
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:23:10.680]   (audience chattering)
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.960]   (audience chattering)
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:32.760]   I am telling it up to you,
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.080]   three sections, chapter one through seven,
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.920]   eight through 12, 13 through 17.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.480]   You can title it Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria,
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.320]   the Gold Spar,
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.840]   or Jews, Gentiles.
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:52.720]   Oh, oh, oh, you cannot use your Bible.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.400]   You cannot use your Bible, okay?
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.320]   That's a big part, I forgot to tell you.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.880]   That's the whole point of this exercise,
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.280]   is for you to, okay?
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:05.440]   (audience chattering)
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.760]   No Bible, no Bible, okay?
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:15.120]   It would defeat the point if you used the Bible.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.320]   There's not a test to see if you can read it.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.520]   (audience chattering)
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.520]   No, no, no, I'm gonna write them all down.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.680]   (audience chattering)
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:34.920]   Huh?
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.080]   (audience chattering)
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.240]   (audience chattering)
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.400]   (audience chattering)
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.040]   (audience chattering)
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:54.760]   (audience chattering)
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:25:03.920]   (audience chattering)
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.080]   (audience chattering)
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:14.640]   (audience chattering)
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:22.120]   (audience chattering)
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:32.440]   (audience chattering)
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.320]   (audience chattering)
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:53.480]   (audience chattering)
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.640]   (audience chattering)
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:09.200]   (audience chattering)
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.480]   (audience chattering)
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:25.280]   (audience chattering)
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:29.000]   (audience chattering)
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.560]   (audience chattering)
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:51.360]   (audience chattering)
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.360]   (audience chattering)
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:05.280]   (audience chattering)
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:12.560]   (audience chattering)
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.840]   (audience chattering)
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:25.480]   (audience chattering)
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:33.280]   (audience chattering)
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.040]   (audience chattering)
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:53.440]   Don't cheat on him.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.600]   (audience chattering)
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.760]   (audience chattering)
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:06.080]   Yes.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.160]   It's up to you.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.120]   I don't want you to worry too much about that.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:18.760]   For now, make sure you put it on the right spot.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.960]   One through seven, eight through 12, 13.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.120]   (audience chattering)
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.280]   (audience chattering)
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:38.680]   (audience chattering)
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:45.600]   (audience chattering)
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.760]   (audience chattering)
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:58.600]   (audience chattering)
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:06.120]   (audience chattering)
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.120]   (audience chattering)
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:22.320]   (audience chattering)
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:36.080]   (audience chattering)
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.200]   (audience chattering)
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:51.360]   (audience chattering)
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.880]   (audience chattering)
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:59.160]   (audience chattering)
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:15.880]   (audience chattering)
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.480]   (audience chattering)
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.760]   At this point, don't worry too much about
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.440]   the exact chronological order.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.320]   Just put it in the right section.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.640]   Does this happen in Jerusalem?
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.600]   Does this happen in Judea and Samaria?
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.240]   Is this an event that happens during his journey?
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:01.040]   'Cause if you try to get it chronologically,
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.400]   you're gonna take too long.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:07.080]   (audience chattering)
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:12.240]   I wanted to see how much you get.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.520]   (audience chattering)
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.520]   (audience chattering)
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.680]   (audience chattering)
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.840]   (audience chattering)
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.000]   (audience chattering)
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.760]   (audience chattering)
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:47.560]   (audience chattering)
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:52.160]   (audience chattering)
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.920]   (audience chattering)
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:07.080]   (audience chattering)
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:11.400]   (audience chattering)
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:16.360]   (audience chattering)
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.480]   (audience chattering)
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:27.640]   (audience chattering)
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:33.520]   (audience chattering)
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:40.320]   (audience chattering)
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:47.320]   (audience chattering)
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.600]   (audience chattering)
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:58.080]   I want you guys to write it out.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.280]   Write out what's there.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.000]   It doesn't have to be word for word,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.600]   but so that when you see it, you know it's there.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.400]   Like you know what you're talking about.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.760]   You don't have to do it word for word.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.000]   I just, you can understand.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.160]   (audience chattering)
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:16.320]   (audience chattering)
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.840]   Okay, you get, I want you to put numbers.
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.840]   I want you to write out.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.520]   You don't have to do it word for word.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.320]   So that when you look at this, you can see.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:32.880]   You don't say, well, what's 11, what's 16, what's 18?
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.600]   So that when you look at it, you can see what it is.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.920]   It doesn't have to be word for word.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.840]   I just want you guys to understand.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.160]   (audience chattering)
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:51.040]   You have to write it out.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:54.200]   (audience chattering)
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.360]   (audience chattering)
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.520]   (audience chattering)
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.680]   (audience chattering)
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:09.880]   (audience chattering)
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:15.520]   (audience chattering)
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:22.320]   (audience chattering)
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:27.960]   (audience chattering)
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.720]   (audience chattering)
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.480]   (audience chattering)
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:41.200]   (audience chattering)
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:46.000]   (audience chattering)
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.560]   (audience chattering)
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:57.200]   (audience chattering)
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:00.480]   (audience chattering)
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:05.520]   (audience chattering)
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:10.120]   (audience chattering)
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:20.320]   (audience chattering)
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:25.720]   (audience chattering)
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:29.000]   (audience chattering)
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.960]   (audience chattering)
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:46.200]   (audience chattering)
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:51.240]   (audience chattering)
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.240]   (audience chattering)
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:36:12.280]   (audience chattering)
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:19.400]   You guys start writing it down.
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.720]   You don't have to get the order exactly.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.520]   Just one through seven, if you think it happened
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.600]   in Jerusalem, put it in that section.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:36.400]   We're gonna work on the chronology together.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.560]   (audience chattering)
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.720]   (audience chattering)
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.880]   (audience chattering)
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:52.960]   (audience chattering)
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:37:03.320]   (audience chattering)
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:08.960]   (audience chattering)
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:13.080]   (audience chattering)
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.240]   (audience chattering)
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:23.600]   (audience chattering)
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:40.160]   Which room is done?
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.960]   (audience chattering)
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:38:05.280]   You don't have to write it word for word,
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:09.440]   but you should be able to recognize what that is.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.960]   (audience chattering)
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:25.640]   It's not a test, it's for you to exercise your mind
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.600]   to figure out where this belongs.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:31.480]   If you have the general area of where you think
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:35.560]   this happened, it'll be easier to memorize later.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.680]   (audience chattering)
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:57.200]   It's a profession.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.600]   Everybody's a professionist.
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.800]   It's all a business.
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.720]   (audience chattering)
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:24.400]   (audience chattering)
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.560]   (audience chattering)
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.840]   (audience chattering)
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.120]   (audience chattering)
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.400]   (audience chattering)
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.680]   (audience chattering)
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.960]   (audience chattering)
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:50.120]   (audience chattering)
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:58.280]   (audience chattering)
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.440]   (audience chattering)
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:15.880]   (audience chattering)
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:21.080]   All right.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:26.720]   Raise your hand if your group is done.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.840]   Is your group done?
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.280]   You guys done?
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.440]   You guys done?
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.400]   Who's not done?
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:40.920]   We need two more minutes.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.240]   One minute for the friends.
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:48.400]   (audience chattering)
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.720]   (audience chattering)
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:41:15.360]   You guys aren't hot, are you?
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.520]   (audience chattering)
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.320]   Are you guys hot?
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:24.280]   Stuffy?
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:29.920]   (audience chattering)
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.520]   (audience chattering)
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.120]   (audience chattering)
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:25.080]   All right, let me have your attention.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.000]   Okay, let's walk through this real quick.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.160]   And again, for those of you who came a little bit late,
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.080]   we're doing review for this week because there's,
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:37.400]   I forget how many, but I think I counted about
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.440]   a third of the people who are in our group now
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.240]   are joining us for the first time,
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.080]   and we're gonna make sure that we're on the same page
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.080]   before we go on.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.800]   Our hope was last time that we would finish
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.080]   our second missionary journey,
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.760]   and then we'll be able to pick up our third one,
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.160]   but we left half a chapter to go.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.240]   So chapter 18, the first section of it
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.320]   is the end of the second journey, okay?
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.040]   But we'll jump into that next week,
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.760]   and it'll be a good review for you.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.360]   Again, like I said, Book of Acts is a continual connection
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.120]   from one event to the other.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.520]   So if you are not connecting these events,
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.240]   you jump in in the middle of chapter seven,
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.520]   then you're not gonna understand what led to that.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:16.560]   Because this is history.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.680]   Just like if you're learning history,
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:22.160]   you can't jump in in AD 55 about that event
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.520]   and try to understand that without knowing
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:28.140]   what happened in AD 54 that led to that, right?
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.240]   So all of these things are connected events.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:33.040]   One event happens that leads to another,
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.400]   and then that event happens, and that leads to another.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.160]   And in the connection of all of these things,
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:39.600]   you see the Holy Spirit directing them.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.840]   The people are not in control here, right?
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.360]   The persecution, the spreading of the gospel,
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.660]   going into Judea and Samaria,
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.700]   having these people from all over the world
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:51.920]   come to Jerusalem, and the Pentecost happening,
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.880]   and then them spreading all of this stuff
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:57.400]   but not stuff that people were able to control, right?
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.280]   You see God maneuvering all of this,
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.760]   and then one event, God allows it to happen,
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.400]   leads to another event, leads to another event.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.880]   So it's important for us to connect chapter 18
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.420]   to what's been going on in the first 17 chapters, okay?
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:13.040]   And again, that'll help us not only connect
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.500]   what we're learning, but it'll help us to connect
[00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.760]   what happens even after, right,
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:18.840]   in the early church history.
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.800]   Like, why did the early church
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.200]   have their church organized this way?
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.560]   Why are these regions this way?
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.240]   Why are the local churches that way?
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.760]   You know, help us to understand, even today,
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.440]   like a lot of the stuff that we are learning,
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.640]   a lot of stuff that we practice
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:35.780]   comes from what we see in the early church, okay?
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.340]   So let's quickly go over this.
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:38.280]   Oh, and another thing is,
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.120]   'cause I'm not gonna mention this again,
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:43.840]   we're going to do our best to start at seven o'clock, okay?
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:47.720]   So again, seven, as close to seven as possible.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.200]   We're going to be having Bible study in this format.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.840]   We're gonna have more group discussion, group interaction.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.720]   So if we run out of chairs, run out of tables,
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:57.840]   we'll set up more tables.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:01.280]   We'll set up, you know, we'll take the tables aside.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:04.360]   And so I want you guys to have,
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.220]   today, because it's the first time
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:08.460]   and you're not familiar with it,
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.140]   you know, everybody's just gonna sit wherever.
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.340]   And it's okay, you can choose to sit wherever,
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:14.260]   but we don't want one table to have 10
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:16.020]   and the other table to have three.
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:19.700]   So that's why we set up seven chairs per table.
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.140]   So starting from next week, if you can,
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:25.660]   if those seven, you know, chairs are filled up,
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:26.900]   to both sit in another table.
[00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.780]   So we don't want one group to have four
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:30.300]   and another group to have eight or 10.
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:31.740]   Okay, starting from next week.
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.660]   And please sign up for that.
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:38.460]   So starting from next week, we'll have a schedule for snacks.
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.460]   So we're gonna use those funds to have snacks
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:43.740]   on the Bible study sessions, okay?
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.580]   And if you guys wanna help sign up for that,
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:46.500]   you can sign up up there,
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.340]   then I'll send you an email for what to do, okay?
[00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:51.860]   All right, so let's begin.
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:55.940]   So what is the first thing that took place?
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.260]   Actually, you know what, let's not do that.
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:00.420]   Let's just look at the events that took place
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:02.980]   in the first seven chapters.
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:07.980]   So just tell me what are in there.
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:12.600]   Okay, I'll do this.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.020]   Each table, give me one.
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:17.240]   Starting from this table.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:21.500]   Okay.
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:25.020]   Okay, 26, Jesus' ascension.
[00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:26.920]   All right, this table right here.
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:29.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:34.640]   Okay, promise of the Holy Spirit.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.520]   Okay, these don't necessarily have to be chronological.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.160]   We'll do that, work on that next.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.800]   Can you tell us a number?
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.080]   Can you tell us a number?
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.240]   What?
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.080]   Number four.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:49.800]   Next.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.480]   (audience mumbling)
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.000]   Can you give us a number so that they can all?
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.640]   Number three, okay.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.640]   Number 19.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.640]   (audience mumbling)
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.800]   Okay, conversion of 3,000.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:06.860]   Number seven, Peter's personal.
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.240]   Okay, next.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.680]   Can you tell us again the right number?
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:13.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.240]   If you're wrong, I'll tell you.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.080]   Okay.
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.040]   Next.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.040]   (audience mumbling)
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:24.780]   Okay, what number?
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.620]   (audience mumbling)
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:42.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:45.160]   If it's wrong, I'll tell you.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.060]   Okay.
[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:50.060]   (audience mumbling)
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:54.060]   Judgment of Ananias' fire.
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.260]   Okay, next table.
[00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:59.380]   Yeah, give us a number and tell us what it is.
[00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:02.820]   Okay, next table.
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:05.220]   - Oh, number eight.
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:07.940]   (audience mumbling)
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:10.140]   - Okay, main man's heel for eight.
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:13.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:19.540]   Okay, the Holy Spirit comes.
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:20.940]   Okay, next.
[00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:24.060]   (audience mumbling)
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:27.340]   Have somebody designate it so that we can just go
[00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:28.180]   boom, boom, boom.
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:32.340]   (audience mumbling)
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:39.220]   Number one through seven.
[00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:43.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:46.520]   Now this is chapter eight.
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:50.260]   You're close, you're close.
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:51.740]   That's B plus.
[00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:54.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:54.980]   Okay, next.
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:49:04.060]   What is that?
[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:07.620]   What does that happen?
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:09.700]   What does--
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:12.700]   (audience mumbling)
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:16.940]   When does James get martyred?
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:20.540]   (audience mumbling)
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:21.380]   Remember?
[00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:25.060]   12.
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:31.940]   Okay, next table.
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:32.780]   Next table.
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:37.220]   All right, good.
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:38.060]   Okay, next.
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:46.100]   Next.
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:49.100]   (audience mumbling)
[00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:54.300]   Huh?
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.140]   That's all?
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:57.300]   What happened?
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.020]   Number one?
[00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:04.380]   Is there anything else?
[00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:08.580]   Yeah, I think somebody said that or not.
[00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:09.420]   Okay.
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:13.420]   31, which is?
[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:16.300]   (audience mumbling)
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:17.980]   Right, that's chapter seven.
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:18.820]   Or six.
[00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:20.660]   Right?
[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:23.180]   What number is that, 31?
[00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:27.300]   (audience mumbling)
[00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:29.340]   The deacons are chapter six.
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:30.180]   Okay.
[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:35.620]   The promise of the Holy Spirit.
[00:50:35.620 --> 00:50:40.180]   Oh, number one here?
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.700]   Oh, did somebody say that?
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:46.220]   No, nobody said that?
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:47.180]   Okay.
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:48.860]   Yeah, that would definitely be it.
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:52.500]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, father of the Gentiles, no?
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:55.500]   (audience mumbling)
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.420]   14?
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:05.820]   What do you think?
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:08.820]   (audience laughing)
[00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:11.340]   That's right.
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:15.260]   (audience mumbling)
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:17.740]   That happens in chapter five.
[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:20.740]   (audience mumbling)
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:25.580]   All right, I think we pretty much covered everybody, right?
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:28.580]   (audience mumbling)
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:33.420]   Right, that would be chapter seven.
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:39.260]   What is group one?
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:41.660]   (audience mumbling)
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:43.620]   That would be the next section.
[00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:45.300]   After the persecution.
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:46.940]   So, remember this, okay?
[00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:51.580]   Chapter seven is a transition to Judea and Samaria.
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:53.340]   And what causes this transition?
[00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:58.140]   Right, persecution, but death.
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:59.260]   Right?
[00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:01.460]   Stephen dies in chapter seven.
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:03.940]   The next transition happens in chapter 12.
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:06.060]   Who dies?
[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:08.180]   James dies, okay?
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:11.460]   So, if you notice that the propelling of the gospel
[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:15.260]   to the next stage happens as an intense persecution happens.
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:19.140]   So, chapter seven, Stephen gets martyred.
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:22.660]   Chapter 12, James gets martyred, right?
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:25.500]   Peter's put into prison, and then Herod dies
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:28.020]   as a result of not giving glory to God.
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:32.740]   And then that takes us to the Gentile world, okay?
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:34.220]   So, just kind of have that in mind.
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:36.340]   Chapter seven, Stephen dies.
[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:38.260]   Chapter 12, James dies.
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:40.940]   Okay, and that's where the transition happens.
[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:44.180]   So, all these events that we talked about
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:45.460]   that's on the first stage,
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:48.580]   that happens primarily in Jerusalem.
[00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:52.820]   All that stuff is taking place as a foundation laying
[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:54.220]   before it gets to the next stage
[00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:56.340]   where what happens in chapter eight?
[00:52:56.340 --> 00:53:02.860]   Stephen dies, so what happens in chapter eight?
[00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:05.460]   As a result of his death?
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:12.460]   They flee because Saul is going after the Christians, right?
[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:15.300]   So, as a result of the fleeing, what happens?
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:20.300]   The gospel goes to Judea and Samaria, right?
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:24.060]   So, the first place that we see the gospel going to is,
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:25.020]   where did they go?
[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:30.460]   Remember how Judea and Samaria looks like?
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:35.300]   See, this is Jerusalem, this is Judea.
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:40.100]   Judea is kind of like the province that Jerusalem is in.
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:41.860]   Samaria is the next province.
[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:45.300]   So, once they come out of Jerusalem, they're in Judea.
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.460]   So, the next area they go to is where?
[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:48.620]   Samaria.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:51.020]   So, as they take off, chapter eight, they take off,
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:52.260]   and where do they end up going?
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:54.740]   What's the first event that we see in chapter eight?
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:54:02.060]   Philip is at Samaria, right?
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:03.980]   So, that's where we begin, chapter eight.
[00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:05.540]   Philip's at Samaria.
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:09.180]   So, again, hopefully this won't take too long.
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:11.380]   Actually, it is gonna take too long.
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:12.580]   We're already at eight o'clock.
[00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:14.620]   All right, let's go over this real quick.
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:17.780]   (audience chattering)
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:33.700]   All right, can you see it?
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:37.660]   Check your answers with what's on the board.
[00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:39.460]   And it is chronologically in order.
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:44.420]   (audience laughing)
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:46.620]   The red's too hard to see.
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:48.380]   All right, so.
[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:51.180]   Huh?
[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:53.180]   Yeah, now it says chronological order.
[00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:54.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:56.100]   That's why I wanted you to write it out.
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:09.500]   Okay, anyway, we won't have time anyway.
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:12.180]   Okay, so I want you guys to check your answers with this.
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:15.940]   But the reason why I put it in these three different colors,
[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:18.300]   I did it on purpose, okay?
[00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.860]   The reason why I put the first section in white
[00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:22.700]   is because white is the beginning.
[00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:25.420]   It is when the Holy Spirit comes, right?
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:27.220]   And it's the foundation link.
[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:32.300]   The second part, in seven, eight through 12,
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:37.300]   is characterized by heavy persecution, okay?
[00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:40.860]   Where they're being put into prison, coming out.
[00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:45.620]   They're being beaten, and James is martyred as a result.
[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:49.340]   So this, I put it in red,
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:51.140]   because as the gospel begins to spread,
[00:55:51.140 --> 00:55:53.340]   the opposition begins to come down on them,
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:56.740]   which is the reason why I put it in red.
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:58.660]   And then the next section, and on,
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:01.500]   I put it in green to represent growth.
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:04.500]   Because once the gospel goes out from Judea and Samaria,
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:06.900]   it starts to go to the Gentile world,
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:08.220]   it doesn't stay in one place.
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:11.180]   It just, boom, it just explodes, right?
[00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:15.100]   So all this time, the work has been centralized in Jerusalem.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:17.780]   In fact, the majority of Israel's history
[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:21.660]   is about what happens in Jerusalem and Judea, right?
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:23.180]   So we're not just talking about
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:24.780]   the period during Jesus' life.
[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:28.300]   We're talking about redemptive history is mainly,
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:32.420]   not only, but mainly focused in Jerusalem and Judea, right?
[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:34.140]   And now the Holy Spirit has come,
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:36.080]   what God has already always intended,
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:38.220]   that it was going to start there, it was going to spread.
[00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:41.820]   So once it gets out of Jerusalem, it doesn't creep out.
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:44.260]   It explodes out, right?
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:48.340]   And so what we're learning only happens in how many years?
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:51.100]   What do we say?
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:57.860]   Approximately, we don't know the exact numbers.
[00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:06.060]   From the book of Acts, it's somewhere around 33 AD.
[00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:06.900]   Right?
[00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:11.860]   But 30, 40 years of history.
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:13.500]   So what we're looking at is what happens
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:16.600]   in about 30, 40 years of history.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.060]   And it's just exploding.
[00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:21.020]   So imagine, it didn't just stop at the book of Acts,
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:24.020]   at Acts chapter 28, right?
[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.740]   That kind of movement happened for the first 300 years.
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:29.060]   It was just exploding, right?
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:32.720]   Not that after 300 years that the gospel stopped,
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.500]   but there was a lot of other problems.
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:36.580]   And once the church became centralized
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:39.220]   and it got organized, they started to try to deal
[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:40.980]   with the problems, the doctrinal issues started
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:44.140]   to get united, and then with that came the politics,
[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:46.060]   and all of a sudden they had to manage the church
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:47.140]   and all this stuff.
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:50.020]   But prior to that, it was almost chaotic,
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:51.820]   just like what you see in the book of Acts.
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:55.420]   These 30, 40 years was exactly how the church was
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:57.620]   for the first 300 years.
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:00.860]   And that's how the Christianity spread all over
[00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:05.860]   to India, to Egypt, to England, and all over the world.
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:09.460]   So again, so this green thing, I put it in green
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:11.540]   because this continues on, it's just gonna continue
[00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:12.880]   to explode, right?
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:17.540]   I'm just gonna review for the next 15 minutes.
[00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:21.900]   So, you wanna check?
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:23.000]   Are you able to check?
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.540]   Can you see?
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:29.020]   You know what, I'll give you five minutes.
[00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:30.540]   Take a look at that, 'cause I don't want you guys
[00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:33.780]   to do wrong, look at your paper, look at that, right?
[00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:37.180]   And see if there's anything that you need to correct.
[00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.820]   I'll give you five minutes.
[00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:40.180]   And then for the rest of the 10 minutes,
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:43.300]   I'm gonna give a quick overview of what's happening
[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:44.600]   in the first 17 chapters.
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:52.820]   Like I said, you don't need to worry about
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:54.860]   the exact chronology, just make sure that it's
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:55.900]   in the right section.
[00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:59.060]   (audience chattering)
[00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:08.580]   Yeah, if they have 38, you have 130.
[00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:11.740]   (audience chattering)
[00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:36.740]   Okay, I'll give you time to take a look at that.
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.100]   As we're reviewing the chapters, you'll see,
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:41.460]   if you got it wrong, you can change it
[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:43.500]   while we're reviewing it, okay?
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:46.100]   All right, so, real quick, chapter one,
[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:48.140]   we said was the foundation name.
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:49.460]   And remember, we talked about that,
[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:51.380]   those of you guys who were with us from the beginning.
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:53.420]   Chapter one basically is a confirmation
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:54.900]   of Jesus' identity.
[00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:58.100]   He resurrects, he reveals himself to many people, right?
[00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.100]   And then he confirms his message.
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:02.420]   He was preaching about the kingdom of God.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:04.940]   And then third, he confirms his method.
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:06.740]   He said the Holy Spirit's gonna come upon you
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:07.900]   and you will be my witness.
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.700]   So it was the Holy Spirit coming, right?
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:13.180]   And that's the theme throughout the whole book of Acts
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:15.300]   and church history.
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:17.620]   Today, if there's one lesson that we're gonna learn
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:20.500]   from the book of Acts is you're effective
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.100]   when you are filled with the Holy Spirit
[01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:23.820]   and you are ineffective when you're not filled
[01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:24.900]   with the Holy Spirit.
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:27.940]   It is not about methods, it is not about organization,
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.540]   it is not about how much they knew
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:30.980]   and how articulate they were.
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:34.740]   It is how much they were filled with the Holy Spirit, right?
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:36.500]   If they're filled with the Holy Spirit, they're effective.
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.380]   So he says that's his method.
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:41.820]   And then at the end, he confirms his disciples, right?
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:46.820]   When Matthias takes Judas' place
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:49.500]   and Peter begins to speak and lead again.
[01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.180]   Because prior to that, he fails utterly.
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:55.180]   Jesus confirms him back in John 21, "Do you love me?"
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:58.040]   And he's restored his personal relationship with Jesus,
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:01.100]   but then we begin to see him leading again
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:02.860]   among the disciples, right?
[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.340]   So that's a foundation laid in chapter one.
[01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:09.420]   Chapter two, the main thing that happens is the Pentecost.
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:11.500]   And with the coming of the Holy Spirit,
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.020]   the inauguration of a new covenant.
[01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:15.820]   The old covenant has gone, the new covenant coming.
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:20.420]   New wine skin for the new wine.
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:25.420]   The Holy Spirit is able to indwell the Christians.
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:26.620]   Why?
[01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:29.900]   Because we've been washed with the blood of Christ.
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:33.460]   We have become new because Christ has forgiven our sins.
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:34.980]   Our sins have been atoned for.
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:38.020]   So now we have become the temple of God, right?
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:41.460]   So now the Old Testament saints could never experience that.
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:42.940]   What we have is the Holy Spirit comes,
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:44.140]   new wine into new wine skin,
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:47.140]   and a new community is established, right?
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:48.820]   So the church begins.
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:51.700]   That's the first beginning of his new community.
[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:57.140]   So again, this is an example of what happens.
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.700]   The Holy Spirit falls.
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:00.500]   All these people from all over the place,
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:02.380]   they're the first ones, right?
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:04.820]   They hear the gospel, they get cut to the heart,
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:06.700]   and these are among the people,
[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:10.140]   the 3,000 first church members of Jerusalem
[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:11.220]   that become Christians.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:14.260]   And then as a result of that event,
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:16.820]   Peter stands up and he preaches the gospel.
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.860]   That's his first preaching.
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.420]   3,000 people come to Christ, and they're baptized.
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:26.020]   The early church, again, the church begins,
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:29.340]   and the church has four things that they were committed to.
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:32.340]   They were committed to apostles, teaching, fellowship,
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:34.860]   breaking of bread, and prayer.
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:37.900]   And those are the things that the early church
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:39.740]   were committed to, right?
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:42.940]   And these are the things that, again, today as a church,
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:44.540]   when we say, "What is the essence of the church?"
[01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:46.940]   We say, "Here it is," 'cause that's what we see.
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:51.540]   Chapter three begins with the healing of the beggar
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:54.220]   at the temple, and it is made very public,
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:57.020]   and that results in Peter preaching his second sermon,
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:01.740]   and it says, "5,000 people come to Christ."
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:05.060]   So the church is exploding in Jerusalem, right?
[01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:09.180]   And then chapter five, we see the first problem that comes,
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:11.140]   and with Ananias and Sapphira pretending
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:13.500]   to have given all when they didn't,
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.860]   and they end up being judged as a result.
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:17.780]   But the interesting thing is this scene
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:20.020]   we see in Acts 5, 13, 14.
[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:21.940]   After the conclusion of this,
[01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:23.660]   says, "None of the rest dared to join them,
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:25.220]   "but the people held them in high esteem,
[01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:27.700]   "and more than ever, believers were added to the Lord,
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:30.620]   "multitudes of both men and women," right?
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:31.900]   Those of you who were with us,
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:33.140]   we see this almost at the end
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.940]   of every event that takes place,
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:38.620]   as if Luke is trying to emphasize,
[01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:40.300]   whether it was persecution,
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:41.920]   whether it was division in the church,
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:43.780]   whether it was dealing with sin,
[01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:47.420]   all of that led to the growth of the church, right?
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:48.660]   'Cause it wasn't the mess then,
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:50.420]   it wasn't because the church was a nice place
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:51.820]   where everybody got together,
[01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:54.740]   it wasn't a place where they felt safe, right?
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:57.060]   In fact, they got persecuted because they came to church,
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:59.340]   they got uncomfortable because they came to church.
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.860]   It's almost as if nothing's going to stop
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:03.580]   the Holy Spirit's movement, right?
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:07.180]   And Luke is trying to go out of his way to emphasize that.
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:10.500]   The apostle's jailed, and then he's free.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:15.780]   And then chapter six, we find another problem
[01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:18.020]   where the community is divided,
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:20.860]   and one group is upset because their widows
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:23.060]   are not being fed, right?
[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:25.900]   So persecution happens, and again,
[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:28.820]   because of that, they establish seven deacons.
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:31.460]   And again, this section ends with,
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:33.380]   and the word of God continued to increase,
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:35.340]   and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly
[01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:37.340]   in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.820]   became obedient to faith, okay?
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:42.620]   So we continue to see this theme over and over.
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:45.740]   Stephen gets martyred, right?
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:47.500]   He's one of the seven deacons.
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.540]   He stands up, he preaches, and as a result,
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:52.860]   persecution happens, right?
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:55.060]   And that takes us to the second section,
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:57.340]   where this is the reason why the gospel goes
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.980]   to Judea and Samaria is because they're fleeing
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.060]   for their life.
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:06.580]   And it is at this section where we find Philip
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:08.940]   preaching the gospel to the Samaritans.
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:11.140]   And Peter and John come to baptize the Samaritans
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:12.660]   with the Holy Spirit, which is interesting
[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:15.620]   because John was one of the, John and James
[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:17.940]   were one of the two brothers who wanted to bring fire
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:19.700]   and judgment upon the Samaritans,
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:22.260]   because they didn't believe what Jesus came through.
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:24.660]   It's ironic now that he's one of the men
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:27.060]   who comes to baptize them with the Holy Spirit.
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:31.940]   And again, in chapter eight, the Ethiopian eunuch converts.
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:34.540]   So again, so you see the same narrative,
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.220]   the gospel spreading, right?
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:37.580]   It's in Samaria.
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:39.700]   An Ethiopian eunuch from a far off land,
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.580]   he comes to Jerusalem to worship God,
[01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:43.860]   and he becomes a Christian, right?
[01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:46.380]   So we don't know much about the Ethiopian eunuch.
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:47.860]   All we know is that he becomes a Christian.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:51.100]   Possibly he goes back to preach the gospel to Ethiopian.
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:58.540]   In chapter nine, Apostle Paul, in order to go
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:01.180]   and drag the Christians back all the way from Damascus,
[01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:02.820]   remember we saw the distance?
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:06.780]   It was not just, he wasn't just going to a neighbor's house.
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:08.780]   He was committed, and if he wasn't going to drag
[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:10.980]   all these Christians back, he needed to have
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:13.660]   a small army to go with him, right?
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:16.260]   And on this journey, he meets Christ.
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:22.260]   And again, it talks about how, as a result,
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:24.940]   the church continues to grow.
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.620]   So just to kind of give you a brief map,
[01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:29.500]   in Acts nine and Acts 10 is where the gospel
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.700]   begins to go to Lyra, remember?
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:36.700]   From Jerusalem to Lyra, and Aenas is the guy
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:40.060]   who gets healed here.
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:43.780]   Remember in Joppa, Tabitha, what's her other name?
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:49.380]   Dorcas, which means gazelle, right?
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:52.500]   And she dies, and then he brings her back to life,
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.540]   and then that begins to spread, and then the next thing
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:57.140]   that happens is, happens in Caesarea.
[01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:58.340]   What happens in Caesarea?
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:04.420]   An important man comes to Christ here in Caesarea.
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:15.780]   Centurion, okay?
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:17.980]   It's not Star Wars.
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:22.940]   Centurion comes to Christ, and what's the significance
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:24.340]   of him coming to Christ?
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.660]   What happens at his house?
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:30.620]   Peter has a dream, right?
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:34.980]   That do not call unclean what God has, I declare clean.
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:36.980]   He has that dream three separate times,
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:41.340]   and then Jesus connects Peter with Cornelius, right?
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:43.500]   Peter goes to Cornelius' house, and he has
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.900]   his family waiting, he preaches the gospel.
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:48.100]   As he's preaching the gospel, what happens?
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:51.700]   Holy Spirit comes upon the Gentiles.
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:56.260]   So, chapter two is the Pentecost for the Jews, right?
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:59.340]   Chapter 10 is the Pentecost for the Gentiles,
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.780]   where the Holy Spirit comes to the Gentiles.
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:03.540]   And then so, when we get from here,
[01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:05.140]   it takes us to chapter 11.
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.700]   What happens at chapter 11?
[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:10.620]   First Gentile church is established,
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:14.540]   which is the church of Antioch, okay?
[01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:15.980]   So, you kind of follow.
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.860]   Everything happens up to chapter,
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:23.140]   so basically, chapter five is Ananias and Sapphira.
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:27.020]   Chapter six is the church being divided
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.620]   because of not feeding the widows.
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:30.940]   Chapter seven is Stephen.
[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:32.780]   Chapter eight is persecution.
[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:37.620]   And then chapter nine takes us out, okay?
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:38.700]   Chapter nine and 10.
[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:44.180]   So, the Gentile church in Antioch
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:46.780]   is first established in chapter 11.
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:48.940]   And that happens to be the first place
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:50.900]   where we are called the,
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:55.580]   we're first called Christians in that area, okay?
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:57.060]   Which was meant in a derogatory way.
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:00.020]   So, chapter 12, there are three major,
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:01.260]   three events take place.
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:03.900]   It begins with the martyr of James.
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:06.620]   Peter is imprisoned, right?
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:09.140]   And then he comes out miraculously.
[01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:10.380]   And then Herod is killed
[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.300]   because we're not giving glory to God.
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:14.500]   Remember, that's a transition into the Gentile world
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:17.940]   because Herod is the king, right?
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:19.420]   Herod is the king of Israel,
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:21.180]   even though he's a puppet king.
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:23.380]   So, it's almost symbolic that he dies
[01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:26.700]   and then now the gospel goes to the Gentile world, okay?
[01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:29.100]   So, chapter seven, Stephen dies,
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.460]   takes us to Judea and Samaria.
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:33.860]   Chapter 12, James and Herod dies,
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:36.460]   and that takes us to the Gentile world, okay?
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:41.820]   Chapter 13 and on is the beginning of the three journeys.
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:44.340]   So, we looked at chapter 13 and 14
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:47.300]   where Paul and Barnabas are sent out from Antioch.
[01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:49.900]   They come to Salamis and pass those,
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:51.340]   who becomes a Christian here?
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:53.380]   The governor.
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:55.340]   Anybody know?
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:57.820]   Right.
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:58.660]   Say it again.
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:01.740]   Sergius, huh?
[01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:03.260]   - Sergius Paulus.
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:04.100]   - Sergius Paulus.
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.380]   He was the governor here
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:09.500]   or Jesus tries to deter that
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:12.220]   and he becomes blind for a period
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:14.460]   and that results in the conversion of the governor here.
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.260]   They come over here to Perga
[01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:17.820]   and then what happens at Perga?
[01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:21.260]   Okay, John Mark takes off.
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:22.980]   He wants to go back home, right?
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:26.020]   He comes, they come to Pisidian, Antioch,
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:28.620]   and he bears tremendous fruit here in Antioch.
[01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:33.460]   In fact, he goes to the synagogue,
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:34.660]   preaches the gospel,
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:36.180]   and they're so interested,
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.700]   they beg him to stay and continue to preach.
[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:40.180]   Right, so he comes back the next week
[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:42.860]   and the whole town comes out to hear him
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:45.900]   and he is so effective that many people come to Christ
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.060]   but as a result, persecution comes.
[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:51.340]   And because of that, he ends up coming to Iconium, right?
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:53.980]   And he again goes to Iconium,
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:56.420]   goes to the synagogues and preaches the gospel
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:58.740]   and these guys are chasing him over here, right?
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:01.100]   The persecution is following him
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:02.140]   and then he goes to Lystra.
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:04.300]   Something important is happening in Lystra.
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:07.300]   It is the first place where?
[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:10.700]   No synagogue, right?
[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:13.180]   This is where Timothy grew up.
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:14.580]   There's no synagogue there.
[01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:15.700]   In order to have a synagogue,
[01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:18.660]   how many Jewish men needs to be there?
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:20.620]   10, so they didn't even have 10 Jewish men
[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:21.620]   and that's probably the reason
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:23.620]   why Timothy was not circumcised,
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:26.500]   even though his mom raised him as a Jew, right?
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.220]   So that's what happens in Lystra.
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.100]   They come to, he gets stoned
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:32.780]   because of these guys coming and getting him,
[01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:34.420]   think he's dead, he comes back in,
[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:36.420]   gathers himself, comes back to Derby
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:37.380]   and then when he's ready,
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:40.380]   he goes back to strengthen these churches, right?
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.180]   And so he makes his trip back over here
[01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:43.580]   and that's the missionary journey.
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:45.340]   It takes about two to three years.
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:47.260]   He comes back to Jerusalem
[01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:49.780]   and in chapter 15, it's not mentioned here,
[01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:51.980]   in between the first and second missionary journey,
[01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:53.420]   what happens in chapter 15?
[01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:57.300]   Something very important happens in chapter 15.
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:02.220]   Jerusalem Council and what is the first decision
[01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:03.740]   that's made, first part?
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:06.740]   (audience mumbling)
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:11.220]   Right, the Judaizers, the circumcision group comes
[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:12.780]   and says the Jews need to be,
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:14.500]   the Gentiles need to be circumcised
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:16.900]   in order for them to become a Christian.
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:18.940]   So they have a council in Jerusalem
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:21.660]   and they decide and they write a letter
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:23.540]   and take it back to the Church of Antioch
[01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:26.180]   and the reason why they go to the second missionary journey
[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:28.260]   is to come check up on the church
[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:30.660]   and second, to take the letter to these Gentile churches
[01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:33.060]   to tell them you do not need to be circumcised,
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:35.300]   to make the gospel clear, right?
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:36.780]   So that's what causes them to come
[01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:39.140]   but what happens in chapter,
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:41.180]   before they leave is Paul and Barnabas
[01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:44.300]   have a discussion about Mark, right?
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.260]   And they come to an agreement.
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:49.380]   Paul wants to take Mark and,
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:51.420]   I'm not Paul, but Barnabas wants to take Mark
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:54.660]   and Paul says no, so Barnabas takes Mark
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:58.500]   and he goes back to Cyprus, which was his hometown, right?
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:00.340]   And that's why they don't go back this way.
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:02.140]   So Paul picks up food.
[01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:05.900]   Who does he pick up as a partner to replace Barnabas?
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:06.740]   - Luke.
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:07.580]   - Silas.
[01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:09.220]   Luke joins, that's a good point.
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:12.260]   Luke joins this mission because it is in his second journey
[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:14.860]   he begins to use the pronoun we.
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:16.380]   We did this and we did that.
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:18.660]   That happens in second missionary journey, okay?
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:20.900]   But Silas is the official one.
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:23.860]   He's probably peers with Apostle Paul.
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:26.060]   He's not a Timothy figure, right?
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:27.860]   Where he's a disciple of Apostle Paul,
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:29.940]   he's a co-worker of Apostle Paul
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:33.500]   and so that's why you see his name on some of the letters.
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.860]   So he comes back, visits Derbe, Iconia.
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:37.980]   He wants to come back and visit some of these churches.
[01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:40.740]   Well, what happens here where he can't go into Asia?
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:44.540]   Holy Spirit prevents him from going.
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:46.140]   He wants to come up to Bithynia.
[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:50.100]   Spirit of Jesus directly says no
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:51.660]   and then he comes over here to Myesia.
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:52.820]   What happens in Myesia?
[01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:56.740]   He has a vision, right?
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:59.180]   Of a man saying come over to Macedonia.
[01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:00.420]   So he comes over to Macedonia.
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:02.300]   What happens in Macedonia?
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.380]   He goes to Philippi, right?
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:05.700]   Does he go to a synagogue?
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:08.220]   There's no synagogue.
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:10.300]   So he goes and looks for a place
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:11.900]   where they're gathered together to worship,
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:14.780]   these God-fears and who does he run into?
[01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:17.580]   Lydia, right?
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:20.860]   Lydia is an important figure in Philippi
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:22.740]   and she was a very prominent woman
[01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:26.340]   who sold purple clothing, right?
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:27.700]   And so it's emphasized.
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:31.740]   And so Lydia is a key figure in Philippi, right?
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:34.180]   So in Philippi, persecution happens
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.260]   as they run to Thessalonica.
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:38.980]   He preaches there for three weeks, right?
[01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:40.340]   But again, persecution is heavy
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:42.460]   so he leaves and then where does he go?
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:43.980]   Berea, right?
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:45.420]   So he's in Berea and again,
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:48.100]   these guys are determined to get him.
[01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:49.660]   They follow him all the way to Berea.
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:53.660]   So he ends up coming to Athens, right?
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:57.660]   And it's in Athens where his spirit is provoked
[01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:02.660]   and then he goes to the marketplace for the first time
[01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:05.460]   where prior to that, he's always going to the synagogues.
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:10.020]   He's deliberately targeting the Jewish people
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:11.060]   'cause they were the first people
[01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:13.980]   that would be willing to hear and make sense.
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:15.900]   But he's deliberately going to the marketplace
[01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:18.460]   and he addresses the Gentile community.
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:21.140]   He does that first in Mystra, right?
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:23.020]   But it is in Athens where he's actually
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:24.340]   at the marketplace itself
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:26.500]   and he preaches the gospel there.
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:28.380]   So I didn't go into the detail of what he said
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:30.900]   but that's sort of where we left off.
[01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:33.260]   All right, so we're gonna finish the Bible study here
[01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:35.100]   but I just want you to know again,
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:41.300]   I was, this is just for me personally,
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:44.220]   coming back from India and spending time
[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:46.900]   with these pastors who are being beaten
[01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:48.500]   and forsaking everything.
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.820]   One of the guys who organized one of the camps,
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:55.820]   he's a lawyer and his full-time job is
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:58.660]   is a lawyer and that's how he makes his money.
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:00.540]   So he doesn't get supported from outside.
[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:03.380]   He actually spends his money to support the pastor.
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:06.540]   He has a network of about 70 different churches
[01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:11.540]   that he works with and he recently was government sanctioned
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:16.940]   to represent government, which is a big deal in that area.
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:19.660]   But we talked to him and for him to be doing
[01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:22.140]   what he's doing, I mean, he's literally risking
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:23.580]   everything that he has.
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:25.700]   And he says the only reason why he's doing that
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:28.940]   is to use it as a platform to preach the gospel.
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:31.940]   And he himself and every single pastor there
[01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:34.980]   who was working in the midst of Muslims and Hindus
[01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:37.500]   are literally risking their health and life
[01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:40.300]   and just like that young guy that I talked about on Sunday.
[01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:44.700]   And their thing is they don't have access
[01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.660]   to the study of the word of God.
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:48.220]   You know, we spent three days teaching them
[01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:50.020]   how to understand the Bible, just like things that say
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:53.300]   don't take narratives and make applications
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:55.460]   that when you read this passage,
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:58.300]   make sure you read the passage before that and after that.
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:01.180]   You can't just pull passage out of it and then explain
[01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:03.660]   and then say that this is what the Bible says.
[01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:06.140]   The basic principles that I think if you've been
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:08.980]   a Christian for a while, you've probably heard it many times.
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:12.820]   Right, don't do eisegesis, do exegesis.
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:14.340]   But these guys have been preaching the gospel,
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:15.740]   some of them for 10, 12 years,
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:18.060]   but they've never been explosive.
[01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:20.780]   So they were so hungry and we were encouraged
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:23.940]   because everything that we said was going to directly
[01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:27.500]   translate into equipping the other Christians
[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:30.340]   that they represent to be more bold
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:31.460]   and stand up for the truth.
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:34.820]   And it was so encouraging for us to know
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:37.700]   that every minute that we spent was spent
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:40.000]   in equipping a church that's being persecuted.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.900]   And again, it just kind of gave me an appreciation
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:45.860]   for what we have here.
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:48.820]   I mean, this is so, we are so abundant
[01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:50.860]   in everything that you can imagine.
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:53.500]   I ate beef jerky for four weeks, not four weeks,
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:56.780]   for two weeks, four bags in two weeks.
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:59.300]   Obviously food was not the biggest issue,
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:03.620]   but we have abundance of food, we have air conditioning,
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:05.580]   we have Bible studies.
[01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:07.380]   Our problem is which one should we go to?
[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:09.860]   We have, which pastor do I like?
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:11.540]   And we're always going, I like John Piper,
[01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:13.900]   I like this guy, 'cause we're just so abundant.
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:17.180]   And it just kind of gave me more appreciation
[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:18.420]   of what we have.
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:20.940]   And when we're self-focused and we don't see
[01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:22.420]   what's going on in the world,
[01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:25.220]   we can easily get bored with all of this stuff.
[01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:26.580]   'Cause I've heard it.
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.100]   And I have to be here because I'm a Christian,
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:29.100]   I'm a member of the Marines,
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.020]   so I have to put my time in here.
[01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:34.060]   Not realizing how precious this is around the world,
[01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:37.100]   and how precious it has been all throughout church history
[01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:39.860]   when it is applied knowing, you know,
[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:41.740]   there are brothers and sisters who are literally
[01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:44.500]   being beaten and were wounded to be beaten
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:46.600]   to have the information that we have here.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.120]   And so it just, again, everything that we're studying
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:52.280]   just made it that much more serious.
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:54.800]   Studying the Word of God, understanding it,
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:57.480]   and then having a platform that we can use
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:00.400]   all the blessings that God has given us in our church,
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.640]   not to use it so that you can have more
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:05.160]   and that you can feel better and you can have more theology,
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.040]   but the stronger our church becomes,
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:09.440]   the more we can get involved with things like that.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.280]   In India and China, you know, in other parts of the world
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:15.760]   that maybe some of you, if you are properly equipped,
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.520]   I think many of you can go there
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.640]   and do exactly what I did.
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:21.040]   You don't have to have a degree
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.360]   because you guys know what they need.
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.960]   You know, anything, everything that I taught,
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:28.200]   I think I could probably pick, you know,
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:30.540]   more than two, three dozen people in our church
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:31.520]   to be able to do that.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.800]   So I feel like if our church is strengthened
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:38.400]   and you're equipped, if what we're trying to do
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:42.300]   is to set up a Bible institute where, again,
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:45.980]   we just tapped into two guys who have a network.
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:48.220]   One guy has a network of 40, 50 churches,
[01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:50.060]   another guy has a network of 70 churches,
[01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:52.660]   but within that network, we met two other pastors
[01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:54.940]   who have 27 and 30 of their own.
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:56.420]   And so each one of them were telling us,
[01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:58.380]   can you please do this for us?
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:00.780]   But what we're trying to do through the network
[01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:02.940]   of the Southern Baptist churches in our area
[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:05.180]   is to establish a Bible institute.
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:07.480]   And a lot of the churches that are going
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:09.260]   or are planning to get involved
[01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:11.940]   are gonna involve their lay people to help out in this.
[01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:13.940]   So people who are able to teach,
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:17.580]   we're gonna take them with us
[01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:19.300]   so that we can have a smaller impact.
[01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:24.220]   So we taught in one camp in front of 150 people.
[01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:26.740]   It's not as effective because we can't answer questions.
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:29.660]   So if we broke that up into four, five different pieces,
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:31.220]   and if we had enough people to go,
[01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:34.220]   just to answer simple questions, right?
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:35.540]   Even just what we went through,
[01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:38.420]   just to go through with them, it would be a tremendous help.
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:41.420]   And then those people who can't teach theology,
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:44.100]   they desperately need to learn English.
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:45.260]   Because if they don't learn English,
[01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:47.060]   they can't get good jobs.
[01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:48.640]   And they're trying to be bi-vocational.
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:52.660]   So there's so many opportunities to serve around the world.
[01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:55.540]   And I really want our church to be equipped,
[01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:57.300]   to be strengthened and grow,
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:59.580]   not so that the community church can be big
[01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:01.900]   and we can have a great place to worship God,
[01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:04.180]   but that this could be used as a platform
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:07.100]   to reach out to places like India.
[01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:09.700]   And I'm sure India is not the only place,
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:11.700]   but many other countries around the world,
[01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.860]   many other places around the world who desperately need us.
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:15.620]   So I really want us to study,
[01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:18.060]   even if it's just a study of chapter 18,
[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:21.780]   it may seem insignificant, but it is not.
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:23.020]   These things that we are learning
[01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:24.600]   equips and strengthens people
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:27.000]   to be able to preach the gospel more effectively.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.380]   So again, I just wanted to share,
[01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:30.300]   really deep in my heart,
[01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:32.160]   I mean, there's a lot of other things that I wanna share,
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.580]   but as we study the book of Acts,
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:38.780]   but not to study it as information, right?
[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:40.460]   Today is the power of salvation
[01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:43.020]   to everyone who believe this is the gospel
[01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:45.740]   that has come down to us, right?
[01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:47.660]   With so many cloud of witnesses
[01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:49.940]   and I hope and pray that we would embrace it
[01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:51.940]   at the same time that we do.
[01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:52.780]   Let's pray.
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:53.860]   And again, I just wanna remind you,
[01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:56.420]   next time you come, please come sit in this.
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:58.020]   And today we'll have this activity,
[01:21:58.020 --> 01:21:59.620]   but next week we're gonna have more discussions
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:01.220]   and prayer time in our small group.
[01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:03.180]   So please sit in this one.
[01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:04.740]   And please come on time.
[01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:06.580]   All right, let's pray.
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:09.620]   Heavenly Father, we wanna praise and thank you
[01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:10.460]   for your goodness.
[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:13.060]   We thank you, Lord God, that you've blessed us
[01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:15.160]   tremendously with everything that we have.
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:19.260]   Lord, we admit that at a time we are spoiled.
[01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:23.980]   With overabundance, we're spoiled, Lord God,
[01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:26.500]   from hearing good sermons on the radio
[01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:27.700]   and in the internet.
[01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:29.780]   We have so much, so many churches,
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:31.940]   so many options that we have.
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:33.660]   And sometimes we forget the big picture
[01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:35.340]   of what you are doing with our brothers
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:37.460]   and sisters around the world.
[01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:41.180]   I pray, Father, that you would raise up a church
[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:43.780]   that would be broken for our brothers, Lord God,
[01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:47.300]   who are sacrificing so much
[01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:49.940]   that more people may come to Christ.
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:52.700]   We pray, Father, that you would connect us
[01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:56.380]   to these things, physically, financially,
[01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:58.740]   emotionally, socially, Lord God,
[01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:01.620]   that our church would not be a kingdom of our own,
[01:23:01.620 --> 01:23:03.900]   but that we would play a small part, Lord God,
[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:04.740]   in what you desire to do,
[01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:06.780]   and what you've always been doing
[01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:08.380]   in the Great Commission,
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:10.980]   making disciples of all the nations.
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:12.860]   So we ask, Lord, that even in our study
[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:14.220]   of the Book of Acts, that you would give us
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:16.500]   a bigger perspective and understanding
[01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:18.860]   of the importance and urgency, Lord God,
[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:22.660]   of why we need a strong church, a equipped church,
[01:23:22.660 --> 01:23:25.380]   a church filled with people who are equipped
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:28.180]   with your word and ready, Lord God,
[01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:31.060]   to say, "Here we are, send us forth."
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:32.940]   So for that end, we pray that you will bless us
[01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:35.820]   that our studies, Lord, would lead to greater fruit.
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:36.780]   Jesus, say we pray.
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:42.140]   If you have not signed your attendance sheet,
[01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:44.180]   please sign it, and again,
[01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:45.260]   the money that we're collecting,
