[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   God, thank you so much.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.480]   God, that you have kept us through spring break.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.640]   So often we forget that you are our sustaining life, that every breath we take is a gift
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.560]   from you and indeed something that is to be treasured and considered precious.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.320]   Father, we know our days are numbered and God, you give us each one.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.400]   And so tonight, would every moment that goes by be seized as an opportunity to worship
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.800]   you, yes, but in this specific method of going into your word and encountering who you are
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.120]   and what you're like in this book of Revelation.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.440]   So God, help us through a book like this.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.320]   Thank you, God, for the great message that's within it, that we as a church can turn our
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.960]   eyes urgently and even pleadingly to this world as we look to the coming of Christ to
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.800]   share this message to those who are in need of it and that it too would sober us, taking
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.180]   our eyes off of the things that might entrap us and ensnare us.
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.440]   And Father, that we would learn what it means and what it looks like to lay aside every
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.160]   weight and every sin which clings so closely and that we would begin to run this race with
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.160]   endurance.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.560]   Okay, so if you could turn with me to Revelation chapter 11.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.480]   And if you were not here with us last week, because I know a lot of you weren't able to
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.400]   because of spring break, or not last week, two weeks ago, we made a decision to go ahead
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.880]   and go through this one chapter at a time.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.640]   So meaning we probably won't be able to finish this book by the end of this quarter.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.080]   I'm not sure if we're going to be going through it over the summer, probably not.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.000]   But what that does mean is you get kind of a head start now into a study of Revelation
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   yourself.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.960]   So you could be studying it even if we don't finish on your own.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.560]   That'd be kind of a cool thing to do as well.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.240]   I do encourage you guys, if you do have time, come early to grab one of those sheets and
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.960]   study through the text beforehand.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.000]   Here's a secondary reason for that, so that you can kind of get here on time too.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I know that's hard.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.200]   I know it's not easy to do that.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.760]   So if you guys are able to come a little bit early and kind of study through the text together,
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.400]   even pray together, and then come down and prepare your hearts for worship, I think it
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.360]   would benefit greatly for many of us.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.120]   Revelation 11 is where we're at, but let's review first.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:49.120]   If you look at that box up above, chapter 1, remember we saw John and the Son of Man,
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.960]   the Son of Man who we know to be the risen Christ.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.600]   He comes and he begins to speak to John and says, "Write down all these things that I'm
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.720]   saying to you and then deliver this message to the seven churches."
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.400]   And that's what we see in chapters 2 and 3, the seven churches.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.520]   And then from chapters 4 through 7, we see a vision in heaven.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.480]   We see the great throne room.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.920]   We see everything worshiping God, everyone worshiping God there in that throne room.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.800]   And then all eyes turn their attentions to this Jesus who is described as the slain lamb.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.600]   And he's given this scroll that all of heaven is hoping would be opened.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:40.120]   And only Jesus, only the slain lamb is able to open up this scroll that is the title or
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.920]   the deed to the earth, that God might redeem the earth once it's opened.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.760]   And with the opening of every seal, we saw God's wrath poured down upon the earth.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:04:00.660]   Then when seal 7 was opened, we heard silence and then we see these trumpets begin to blow.
[00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:08.160]   We went through the first six trumpets and then two weeks ago, we went into that interlude.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.680]   So today what we're going to be doing is going into this second part of the interlude into
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.400]   the seventh and final trumpets.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.200]   So just to give you a snapshot of the future as well, what we see, a lot of the action
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.140]   is going to center around three sets of seven.
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.440]   So there's the seven seals, seven trumpets, and then the seven bowls.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.920]   What you see in between are interludes and things happening.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.240]   There are kind of breaks in the action to describe whether it be in the future or in
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.660]   the past, things that have happened or are going to happen.
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:48.920]   And then it continues the narrative of how it all unravels.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.920]   So that's it.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.480]   If you look down at chapter 11, verse 1, we'll read from verse 1 through 3.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.660]   It says, "Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff and I was told, 'Rise and measure
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.920]   the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.680]   But do not measure the court outside the temple.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.220]   Leave that out for it is given over to the nations and they will trample the holy city
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.340]   for 42 months.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.200]   And I will grant authority to my two witnesses and they will prophesy for 1,260 days clothed
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.200]   in sackcloth."
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:26.120]   So in verse 1 there, we see we're introduced to this thing called the measuring rod.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.520]   And then this is what's told to him.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.920]   "Take this measuring rod and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.920]   there."
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.080]   So for those of you who are able to kind of take a look at this, the big question is,
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.800]   what is that?
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.400]   What is this measuring rod and why are we doing it?
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.920]   Or why is he being called to measure the temple?
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.400]   If you look at that first bullet point, a measuring rod was usually a hollow reed-like
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.920]   plant light enough to be used to measure.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.440]   So if you guys have ever had like one of those sticks that are hollow inside and it's like
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.140]   almost like a bamboo type thing, very light.
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:13.440]   And so this was something used during this time, very ideal for measuring anything.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.760]   And many times buildings would need to be measured and so they would use these reeds.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.400]   And so that's what this is.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.040]   God asked John to measure the temple.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.040]   So here's a question built in for you guys.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.480]   You guys can turn to your neighbor and ask this of each other.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.200]   Why do you think God asked John to measure the temple?
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:40.200]   Make your best guess at this with your neighbor.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.040]   (chairs clacking)
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.200]   (audience chattering)
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.040]   (chairs clacking)
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:57.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.200]   (audience chattering)
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:22.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.460]   (audience chattering)
[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.620]   (audience chattering)
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.500]   It's tough, here's a hint.
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.180]   Think about what the temple is for,
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.260]   and like why, yeah.
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.340]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.020]   Are you guys done?
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:07.860]   Did I just cut it?
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:24.700]   Okay.
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.580]   So let's talk about that a little bit.
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.900]   The next bullet point down there.
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.340]   The temple and altar were seen
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.500]   as a presence of God with Israel.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.500]   So to measure them was to measure the standard
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.100]   by which God would dwell with his people.
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.700]   There were terms to his presence.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.900]   God would not dwell with people
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.220]   who did not measure up to his law.
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:52.940]   And so the temple was the very means
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.980]   by which God would dwell with his people.
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.740]   Remember what would happen if you think back
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.540]   to the top of the mountain when Moses,
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.540]   during the time of Moses,
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.380]   there'd be crazy things going on
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.900]   as God descended upon the mountain,
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.540]   and it says that if anybody touches the mountain,
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.900]   what happens to them?
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.740]   They die.
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.500]   If they touch the mountain, they die.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.540]   That's weird, right?
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.300]   But you touch it, and you're gone.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.140]   Why?
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.860]   Because the very presence of God is that great.
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.340]   That is the biggest problem of humanity,
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.100]   that God's presence has to be removed from humanity.
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.140]   If his presence is not removed from humanity,
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.780]   what happens to sinful people before a holy God?
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.580]   You're obliterated.
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.660]   You're annihilated.
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:40.620]   And so the temple was almost God's redeeming solution
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.380]   as to how he would bring his presence to people
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.140]   because God's presence is the only means to life itself.
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.420]   And so this temple was given to them.
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.340]   Now, if the temple and the altar within it,
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.140]   which was a special part of it,
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:03.060]   was this understanding of the presence of God with Israel,
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.100]   to measure it was to make sure that it needs to be done
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.740]   exactly the way God dictates it to be done.
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:15.500]   So for a little bit more clues
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.820]   as to what we're looking at here,
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.180]   if you could turn in your Bibles with me
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.780]   to Ezekiel chapter 43.
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:24.420]   Ezekiel chapter 43.
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:46.660]   Ezekiel 43.
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.500]   Ezekiel 43.
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:59.380]   All right, and it says in 43 verse six,
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.900]   "While the man was standing beside me,
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.980]   "I heard one speaking to me out of the temple.
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.080]   "And he said to me, 'Son of man,
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.480]   "'this is the place of my throne
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.980]   "'and the place of the soles of my feet
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.180]   "'where I will dwell in the midst
[00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.420]   "'of the people of Israel forever.'
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.260]   "And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name,
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.500]   "neither they nor their kings,
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.700]   "by their whoring and by the dead bodies of their kings
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.380]   "at their high places.
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.580]   "By setting their threshold by my threshold
[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.720]   "and their doorpost beside my doorpost,
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.220]   "with only a wall between me and them,
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.080]   "they have defiled my holy name
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.060]   "by their abominations that they have committed,
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.460]   "so I have consumed them in my anger.
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.260]   "Now let them put away their whoring
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.700]   "and the dead bodies of their kings far from me,
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.580]   "and I will dwell in their midst forever.'"
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.760]   Verse 10, "As for you, son of man,
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.180]   "describe to the house of Israel, the temple,
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.540]   "that they may be ashamed of their iniquities,
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.240]   "and they shall measure the plan.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.080]   "And if they are ashamed of all that they have done,
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.100]   "make known to them the design of the temple,
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.040]   "its arrangements, its exits and its entrances,
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.860]   "that is, its whole design,
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.240]   "and make known to them as well all its statutes
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.280]   "and its whole design and all its laws,
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.400]   "and write it down in their sight
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.100]   "so that they may observe all its laws
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.180]   "and all its statutes and carry them out.
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.680]   "This is the law of the temple.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.400]   "The whole territory on the top of the mountain
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.140]   "all around shall be most holy.
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.960]   "Behold, this is the law of the temple."
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.140]   Now, if you guys can just scan through
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.500]   the remaining chapters in Ezekiel after that,
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:35.180]   chapter 43, 44, look at some of the headings,
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:40.180]   45, 46, all the way through 47,
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.900]   what you're gonna be seeing is very specific
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:49.180]   measurements of the temple
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.900]   and everything that goes along with the temple.
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:52.740]   Why?
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.580]   Because this is the way God's presence
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.780]   is going to come to his people.
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.020]   And so you need to come very carefully
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.380]   before the presence of God.
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:08.860]   There are a few things that kinda go along with this.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.540]   What that means is that there are standards
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.140]   to access his presence.
[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:20.460]   There are people, even during this time in Ezekiel,
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.220]   he's saying that these people are not doing it
[00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.100]   the way they're supposed to be doing it.
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.220]   He's saying, "They're living right next door to me,
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:33.040]   "and because they're living in this abomination-like way,
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.280]   "he will destroy them."
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.660]   Now, I know we're New Testament people,
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.340]   and I know we are post-Christ
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.740]   in terms of what we saw on the cross
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.220]   in that gracious and loving and merciful work
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.540]   that Jesus did, and yet this is the exact same God
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.500]   that we serve.
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.540]   That if these standards are set,
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.460]   and these are the standards by which we're called
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.700]   to go into the presence of God,
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.420]   then think about how are we,
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.280]   it says this in Hebrews chapter four, right,
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.080]   that we are now able to enter into the presence of God,
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.540]   into his throne room of grace, we're able to enter that.
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.440]   Think about what must have been done,
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.480]   what was accomplished by this man named Jesus
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.520]   that we can now, through him, have access to God's presence.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.320]   Now, I was at AA this past weekend,
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.080]   they asked me to preach on the Holy Spirit,
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.280]   and so I've been thinking about the Holy Spirit a lot,
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.640]   but that understanding that not only are we able
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.740]   to have access into the presence of God,
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.040]   but that the very presence of God himself
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.780]   is sealed into our hearts.
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.940]   (silence)
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:42.540]   See, access to God is what gives life
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.340]   for people and for us.
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:49.080]   I think it brings another question to us.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:54.240]   God is the one by which we receive life and access to life,
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.420]   but I think so many times we take it,
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.580]   we take it so flippantly, right?
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.300]   Yeah, we know we have God now,
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.340]   and so what inevitably happens is,
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.020]   we think because we have this and we can kind of live
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.740]   however we would want to live,
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.960]   that now we can go to some other things
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.700]   that this world would offer to give us life.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.100]   I think we go to the things of this world for life
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:26.220]   very, very often, and we seek it in different places.
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:31.380]   And what we see here in Revelation chapter 11,
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.860]   if you could go back to the original text,
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.780]   he says, "Rise and measure the temple of God
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.180]   "and the altar and those who worship there."
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.020]   In verse two it says,
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.140]   "But do not measure the court outside the temple.
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.740]   "Leave that out, for it is given over to the nations,
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.420]   "and they will trample the holy city for 42 months."
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:58.380]   So we're seeing something interesting here,
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.740]   that God's presence comes, and he's saying
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.380]   that the only way that you're going to be able
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:07.140]   to have my presence forevermore is by doing this correctly.
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.260]   And Israel hasn't done it correctly,
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.560]   neither has the world, right?
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.460]   The world has not been abiding by the law of God.
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.520]   And so what we're seeing out through Revelation
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.380]   is the wrath poured out against lawbreakers.
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:24.340]   And so what he's trying to do in redeeming the earth
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.940]   as he opened up every seal,
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.100]   as he's been trying to bring redemption to the earth,
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.540]   he is making a way for the earth
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.540]   to look the way he calls it to be.
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.780]   And actually there is going to be a time
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.900]   where the new Jerusalem is going to be brought.
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.180]   That's the next bullet point there.
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.200]   We see in Revelation chapter 21, verse 15 through 17,
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.920]   that a measurement would be taken again at the end,
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.920]   at the end, at the new Jerusalem.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.820]   And it says this in Revelation chapter 21,
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.080]   verse 15 through 17.
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.620]   And the one who spoke with me had a measuring rod of gold.
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.460]   That's an upgrade, right?
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.940]   From a reed-like thing to gold,
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.300]   to measure the city and its gates and walls.
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:05.920]   The city lies four square,
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.540]   its length the same as its width.
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.820]   And he measured the city with this rod, 12,000 stadia.
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.940]   Its length and width and height are equal.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:17.080]   He also measured its wall, 144 cubits by human measurement,
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.840]   which is also an angel's measurement.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.960]   We'll talk about that more if we ever get there,
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.060]   which we probably won't, so we won't talk about it.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.540]   But whatever the case,
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.420]   God is bringing the world into a place
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.520]   where everything is going to fall under his standard.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.780]   Everything is gonna be brought to completion.
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.400]   Everything is gonna be brought to perfection.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.900]   Every person is going to fall in line with that.
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.940]   And there's this understanding
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:49.160]   that every tongue is going to confess Christ as Lord.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.980]   It doesn't matter in heaven and also in hell.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.380]   Everyone is gonna know that Christ is Lord.
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.820]   And we're gonna see a little bit of that
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.380]   later on in Revelation as well,
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:05.380]   that there are people who are proclaiming God and his glory,
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:09.940]   even though they haven't repented
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.720]   and brought a submissive heart before him.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.180]   So the next bullet point down there,
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.500]   John is told not to measure the court outside the temple,
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.820]   which is the court of the Gentiles.
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.820]   This describes the fact that unbelievers will trample
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.140]   on a true worship of God.
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:32.900]   God will continue to keep Israel under his protection.
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:39.100]   I think we see a glimpse of this in today's world,
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.140]   that the world is trampling on the law of God, right?
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.500]   The standards that God has set.
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.660]   Man, we are so good.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.820]   Society has been so good at trampling on it
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.780]   and saying, you know, God, not by your standards,
[00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.320]   not by your law, not by your word,
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.340]   but what we set as good and evil.
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:04.580]   We see it in the homosexual agenda.
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.300]   We see it on the attack against marriage.
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:11.300]   We see it in all these different places of government
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.660]   and things that are being brought to light now
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.220]   about what we think is right or wrong.
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.960]   When we went on campus evangelism a few weeks ago,
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.260]   you know, Brandon, Brandon and I,
[00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.100]   I don't know if Brandon's here,
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.700]   but Brandon and I, we went out
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.780]   and we were talking to this person
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:32.180]   who believed in no absolute truth.
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.020]   And we've talked to people like that before.
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.620]   They don't believe in absolute truth.
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.420]   And as we're talking, you know, you realize,
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.540]   so what this guy was saying was,
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:43.000]   you know, like I'm a Catholic and I believe in God,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.360]   but if people don't believe in God, then yeah,
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.020]   for them, God doesn't exist.
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.500]   And I was like, so you're saying that you can believe
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.340]   that God doesn't exist and that'll make him not exist.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:00.080]   I said, I said like, so if I were not a Christian,
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.260]   if I were like a Hindu and I was coming to you
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.660]   and I said that your God doesn't exist,
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:08.300]   you'll say, yeah, you're right, meaning that you're wrong.
[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.480]   And he would say, yeah, but in me, I'm right.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.980]   And, you know, I was thinking,
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.140]   how does someone get to a point
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.220]   where you start talking in circles like that?
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.100]   And yet this is deeply rooted into the way,
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.580]   not only the world thinks, but even some of how we think.
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:31.020]   What is right, what is wrong, how we set the standards
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.140]   that we say, yes, this, but we're actually saying
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.460]   something completely different.
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.200]   And in that, we're changing the measurements of this temple.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.180]   We're changing the law and the standards
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.460]   by which God would say, this is how you receive life.
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.540]   This is how you receive my presence.
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.460]   This is how you receive my presence.
[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.460]   This is how you receive my presence.
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:59.460]   Law, standards, this book that we have in front of us
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:04.260]   and everything, the parameters by which it bounds us in
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:08.060]   is God's grace on us, that we might know
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.240]   what is good, what is evil.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.220]   Before I became a believer,
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.980]   I thought that the law was the most restricting thing.
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.380]   It was so many rules, that was so,
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.580]   it was such a killjoy.
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:25.900]   Okay, it says all these things that I have to do.
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:29.900]   And yet, once I became a believer,
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.260]   the law became so sweet to me.
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.180]   It gives us parameters.
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.340]   It's clear communication as to what God is saying.
[00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.260]   This is who I am.
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:43.100]   And this is how you enter into my house.
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.660]   I don't touch hair dryers.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.260]   That's my son, he just turned a year,
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.460]   or he's almost a year.
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.500]   He's a year tomorrow.
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:57.980]   Yes, everybody turns a year at one point in time in life.
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.740]   So he's a year soon, and then one of the things
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.060]   we don't let him do is a hair dryer
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.580]   that's kind of near to the ground
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.300]   because there's like this little slot for it.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.180]   And we taught him not to touch it.
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:13.180]   But you know, what if Hudson was going after this hair dryer
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.780]   and we had never told him that it was off limits,
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:20.580]   that we had never done that, right?
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:24.380]   And then with Hudson, anytime he touches something dangerous,
[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.220]   we give this tiny little flick on the hand
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.420]   and he doesn't like it, right?
[00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.740]   It doesn't hurt at all, it just hurts his heart.
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.820]   So like, we do that little flick like that.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:37.060]   But let's say that he, I never told him about the hair dryer.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.860]   I never said it was off limits.
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.100]   And he crawls towards it and he puts his hand on it
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.860]   and I flick his hand, I say, "No!"
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.340]   That's messed up of me, right?
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:52.540]   But it is in my goodness and my grace to Hudson to say,
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.940]   "Before he touches it, don't touch that."
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.340]   You touch that, you could pull on it,
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.420]   you could get electrocuted,
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.980]   you could do some dangerous things when you nod
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.460]   and he nods on everything.
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.220]   And then so if he touches it again,
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.620]   then it's like, I said, "No!"
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.180]   Don't do that, you're gonna get hurt.
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.940]   And that's how you learn.
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:16.940]   And that's what standards and laws are given to us for.
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:24.660]   And when you see the perfection that we are called to,
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.340]   that we cannot be even an inch off of these measurements,
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:34.260]   that we cannot even mess up a teeny little bit,
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.940]   that we begin to see the gravity
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.140]   as to what Christ did for us on the cross.
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:45.780]   What it means that a perfect man died on the cross
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:49.540]   for our sin so that we might have access
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.660]   to the presence of God.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:55.980]   So I love John 1:14 that talks about Jesus,
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:59.500]   this word who became flesh and he pitched a tent among us,
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.340]   he tabernacled among us,
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.900]   that the presence of God might be with us.
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.020]   And so we're introduced to these two witnesses.
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:17.100]   We'll get to some of these numbers, by the way.
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:17.940]   But in verse three it says,
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.140]   "And I will grant authority to my witnesses,
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:23.220]   "and they will prophesy for 1,260 days,
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.180]   "clothed in sackcloth.
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.520]   "These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.180]   "that stand before the Lord of the earth."
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.080]   Verse five, "And if anyone would harm them,
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.160]   "fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.280]   "If anyone would harm them,
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.760]   "this is how he is doomed to be killed."
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.140]   So there's these two guys that kind of appear,
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.980]   really amazing people.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.180]   This is kind of, they're like crazy people.
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:49.820]   And these people are sent to witness to a world
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.180]   that is trampling upon the law of God.
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:56.260]   And so what we saw, that the court of the Gentiles,
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.100]   well it was a place that God allowed to be trampled.
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.600]   And he kept the court of the Jews,
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.660]   the middle part of the temple, unfaced.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.380]   That he was protecting Israel in a sense.
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.900]   And that the world is coming closer and closer
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:15.900]   into this attack of a true worship of God.
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.580]   And we're gonna talk a little bit more about that,
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.620]   but these two witnesses appear in this manner.
[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.460]   And as they're described as two olive trees
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.580]   and two lampstands, let's describe what those mean.
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:30.040]   Lampstands are lights that will proclaim truth.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:38.080]   And olive trees are the source of oil
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.400]   by which lampstands are lit.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:47.420]   Next bullet point there.
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.080]   Since they are both the lampstand and the olive tree,
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.180]   it shows that there is a constant flow of oil
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.300]   to the lampstand.
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.800]   Their power comes directly from God.
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.900]   (pages rustling)
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:11.200]   These guys are prophesying.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.700]   It says that in verse three.
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.540]   And I will grant authority to my two witnesses
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.700]   and they will prophesy for 1260 days,
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.780]   clothed in sackcloth.
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.020]   Now here's a question for you guys to turn to a neighbor
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.100]   and ask each other this question.
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.260]   What does it mean to prophesy?
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.720]   So go ahead and have a conversation about that.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:34.320]   Don't look.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.400]   (audience murmuring)
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.320]   (audience murmuring)
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.400]   (audience murmuring)
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.480]   (audience murmuring)
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.560]   (audience murmuring)
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.640]   (audience murmuring)
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:09.360]   (audience murmuring)
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:15.960]   (audience murmuring)
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.040]   (audience murmuring)
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:42.840]   All right, so prophesying answers right there.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.720]   To speak forth, to proclaim, or to preach
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.840]   it is not primarily used to describe
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.600]   a foretelling of future events.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.360]   That might happen, and that has happened
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.720]   if you look in the Old Testament
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.680]   and you see these prophets and things like that.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.880]   However, their job is to be the mouthpiece of God,
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.000]   saying the words of God to a generation of people
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.440]   who need to hear it.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:13.800]   And these two witnesses are prophesying.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.920]   And their clothed in sackcloth.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.240]   Sackcloth, that's the next bullet point down,
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.120]   is mourning and distress.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.760]   That's when people would wear it.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:28.080]   Mourning and distress.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.880]   And I have some passages there.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.960]   You can look on your own if you wanna see
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.320]   some examples of that.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.040]   These times where a lot of these prophets
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.440]   even will come in sackcloths
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:44.440]   and pour out this mourning, lamenting type of prophecy
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.200]   of God, that God is saying that you are going
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:51.640]   to be extinguished if you do not follow
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.360]   my commands, my laws.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.880]   If you do not stop going after idols.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:59.520]   And extinguishing, that we always see with that,
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.880]   that God is saying that I am going to be faithful
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.960]   to preserve you even in the midst of that.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:08.000]   So these guys are doing that, these two men.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.520]   And they're doing it for 42 months.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.800]   So note that number there.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.400]   Note the number, 42 months in chapter 11 verse two
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.800]   with the numbers given in chapter 11 verse three,
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.720]   chapter 12 verse six, chapter 12 verse 14,
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.760]   and chapter 13 verse five.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.920]   What I'm gonna ask you to do is to kinda look
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.920]   at those passages on your own right now if you can.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.360]   But just note the numbers.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:33.280]   Chapter 11 verse two with the 11 three, 12 six,
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.480]   12 14, and 13 five.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.320]   (throat clearing)
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.160]   (throat clearing)
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.000]   (throat clearing)
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.400]   So all of these numbers, if you haven't caught on,
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.240]   is actually the same number.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:19.680]   So in chapter 11 verse two, 42 months, what is that?
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.840]   How many years is that?
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.760]   Three and a half years, right?
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.200]   12 times three is 36, plus six.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.040]   So that's three and a half years.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.440]   If you look at chapter 11 verse three, 1,260 days.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.240]   If you divide that by 30, do you know how many you get?
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.720]   Math majors, 42.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.640]   30 days, huh, no, am I wrong?
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.400]   It is, right?
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:50.400]   1,260 days divided by 30 is 42, 42 months.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.880]   And then if you look at chapter 12 verse six,
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.960]   what number is given there?
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.400]   It's 1,260 days again.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.040]   And chapter 12 verse 14, we see it for time and times
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:00.880]   and half a time.
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.360]   That's directly taken from the book of Daniel.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.680]   But that is, a time is a year.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.920]   Times is two year, and half a time is half a year.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.680]   One plus two plus half is three and a half.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.520]   Okay, cool.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:16.040]   And then chapter 13 verse five,
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:19.960]   you see 42 months yet again.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.000]   This number, if you look at that bullet point down,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.160]   correlates with the last half of a seven year tribulation
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.480]   called the Great Tribulation.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.360]   Now the seven year tribulation time
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.640]   is something we've already been seeing the first half of.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.720]   And the second half is going to be called
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.480]   the Great Tribulation.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.800]   Okay, so the whole thing is a tribulation,
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.640]   but the second half is just even worse.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.760]   And God will continue, here are the blanks,
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.000]   preserving Israel until he fulfills his promises to them.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.320]   That's what's happening in chapter 11
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.200]   with these two witnesses who are coming
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.000]   in the midst of a world that is trampling,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.960]   trampling the world.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.840]   They have come, and if you could think
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.080]   about the presence of God,
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.440]   if it's found in the holy city of Jerusalem,
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.080]   like everything is starting to get,
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.360]   it's shrinking in on them, right?
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.600]   Like the world has become so evil to the point
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.240]   that God is preserving just the center point of the temple.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.920]   That the whole city of Jerusalem
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.800]   to the center point of the temple
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.600]   has now been trampled over by the Gentiles.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.600]   And that God is preserving them.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.920]   Now the next bullet point down,
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.400]   if you look at verses four through six,
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:41.040]   we see some of the power that these two witnesses have.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.840]   Listen to this, in verse five it says,
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:47.160]   if anyone would harm them, fire pours from their mouth
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.040]   and consumes their foes.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.200]   If anyone would harm them,
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.400]   this is how he is doomed to be killed.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.880]   They have the power to shut the sky
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.800]   that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying,
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.280]   and they have power over the waters
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.560]   to turn them into blood,
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.000]   and to strike the earth with every kind of plague
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.520]   as often as they desire.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:07.760]   The identity of two witnesses is up for speculation,
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.880]   however, a good guess might be that this is describing
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.160]   two Moses and Elijah-like figures.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:23.040]   And we're not gonna go too deeply
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:26.600]   into trying to figure out the identity of these people
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.560]   or are they gonna be actual,
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.040]   like these two actual people and all this kind of stuff.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.920]   We're not gonna talk about that today.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:37.080]   However, we do know they do mimic Moses and Elijah
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.760]   very similarly.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.680]   Bullet point in everything there.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.560]   They would destroy enemies with fire,
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:43.840]   we saw that with Elijah.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.480]   Withhold rain, Elijah did that.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.680]   Turn water into blood, Moses did that.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:51.600]   Strike the earth with plagues, Moses was there with that.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.640]   These were all judgments inflicted upon hard hearts
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.880]   in the Old Testament to enact the justice of God
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.560]   and discipline to repentance.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.880]   These were two individuals who also appeared
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.320]   in the transfiguration.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:06.200]   If you remember that moment where Peter and John
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.240]   and James are taken and Jesus says, "Wait here,"
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:15.240]   and they go and they see Moses and Elijah come.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:20.120]   And this is speculation, and it's quite a big speculation,
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.360]   but I just thought it was interesting.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.240]   Could they possibly represent the law and the prophets?
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:29.920]   Now, some people think that maybe Enoch
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.560]   could be one of these men, an Enoch-like figure.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:37.120]   There are some others, but I personally thought
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:41.840]   that Moses and Elijah were the most likely figures.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:47.760]   So these men are here, and they are prophesying,
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.360]   and they are preaching, and they are showing
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:53.720]   the wrath of God upon this world.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:58.720]   They are saying, "Constantly repent."
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.440]   They are saying constantly who God is.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.040]   And as they're doing that, people are trying
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:08.080]   to get at them, to kill them, and God's wrath
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:11.400]   is unleashed upon people because they can't kill them.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.000]   People can't kill these two men.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.600]   Instead, they are dying.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:21.560]   And you'll see that a lot in Scripture.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.360]   You're gonna see power of God.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.920]   You're gonna see it with both Elijah and Moses,
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.040]   but you'll also see it all through the Gospels.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:31.200]   Every time Jesus performs a miracle,
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.320]   right around it, you're going to see
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.080]   that Jesus was teaching and preaching.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.600]   Every time these acts and powerful works,
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.680]   miracles and things that were happening
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.240]   with healings and these kinds of things
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.680]   was always accompanied to show the power
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.640]   by which these words are spoken.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:54.040]   It was proof and evidence of the power of the words.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:58.840]   So God is doing that here through these two witnesses.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:02.320]   Now in the middle of this, the beast comes out.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.840]   Look down at verse seven.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.720]   It says, "And when they have finished their testimony,
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.560]   "the beast that rises from the bottomless pit
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.280]   "will make war on them and conquer them and kill them.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:13.320]   "And their dead bodies will lie in the street
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.680]   "of the great city that symbolically
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:18.400]   "is called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified."
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.880]   Now this beast, we have to try to figure out who this is.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.560]   This is probably not Satan for two reasons.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.320]   Number one, Satan is described as a fallen star
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.640]   and a dragon in Revelation.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.640]   Chapter nine, verse one, we see the star.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.280]   Chapter 12, verse three, we see the dragon.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.480]   And number two, Satan is given the key
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.560]   to the bottomless pit from the outside,
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.000]   but this beast comes from the pit itself.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.240]   So to answer it quickly is, he is the Antichrist,
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.680]   as described in Revelation chapter 13, verse one through 10.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.560]   A world ruler empowered by Satan.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.440]   So we're gonna get to him later on in chapter 13.
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:06.320]   Now if you could turn with me to 1 John 2, verse 18.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.860]   Let's talk a little bit about this Antichrist.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:14.480]   1 John, it's just a couple books before Revelation.
[00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:20.400]   1 John 2, verse 18 through 22 is what we read.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:30.560]   And it says, "There are children, it is the last hour.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.020]   "And as you have heard that Antichrist is coming,
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:35.320]   "so now many Antichrists have come.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.920]   "Therefore we know that it is the last hour.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.160]   "They went out from us, but they were not of us,
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.280]   "for if they had been of us,
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.000]   "they would have continued with us.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.280]   "But they went out that it might become plain
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.800]   "that they all are not of us.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.460]   "But you have been anointed by the Holy One,
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.940]   "and you all have knowledge.
[00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.000]   "I write to you not because you do not know the truth,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.420]   "but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth."
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.380]   Verse 22, "Who is the liar but he who denies
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:01.240]   "that Jesus is the Christ?
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.040]   "This is the Antichrist,
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.000]   "he who denies the Father and the Son."
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.580]   Interestingly, the person who wrote Revelation was
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.860]   the Apostle John.
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:13.960]   Who wrote 1 John?
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.860]   It was the Apostle John.
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.620]   And so as he's describing this Antichrist,
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.200]   he's showing the spirit of the Antichrist,
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:24.700]   that the Antichrist is someone who would deny Jesus
[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:28.320]   as the Messiah and say that there are other ways
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.280]   to salvation, that I am the Savior.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:39.700]   The crazy thing about these Antichrists,
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.860]   and the spirit of the Antichrist exists even today.
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.860]   We saw that in the earlier verses there,
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:49.980]   that that spirit can exist,
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:53.220]   that it can deny Jesus as the true Christ.
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:58.220]   Antichrists and false prophets come out from churches.
[00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:01.820]   They come out from people who claim to be religious
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:05.780]   and who may very well look godly
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:08.320]   and have forms of godliness.
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.380]   This is a great danger,
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:15.340]   that it comes from supposed Christ followers.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.300]   It's something we have to think about.
[00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:21.040]   You know, when we think about all of these different attacks
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.660]   upon the gospel and the church,
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:28.500]   that we are not exempt from this,
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:29.940]   that Berean, that we as a church,
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:33.620]   we're not exempt from attacks of false prophets,
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:36.800]   of Antichrist-like spirits,
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.820]   people who will say that Jesus is not enough,
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.440]   that his work was not enough, that we must do,
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.340]   people who will say the exact opposite,
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:49.140]   that says Jesus is everything, we just point to him
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:50.780]   and we don't need to do anything.
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:54.800]   We see it in the prosperity gospel,
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.260]   that says these false things,
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.940]   that ultimately salvation is not from anything more
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.920]   than the bad things that this world might throw at us.
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.660]   There's a lot of things that can kind of go with this,
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.600]   spirit of the Antichrist.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:16.340]   We see that in 2 Timothy 3, verse one through five.
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:18.860]   You don't have to turn there.
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.720]   2 Timothy 3, verse one through five, it says,
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.220]   about godlessness in the last days.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.900]   It says, "But understand this, that in the last days,
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.880]   "there will come times of difficulty,
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.960]   "for people will be lovers of self, lovers of money,
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.200]   "proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to the parents,
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:35.780]   "ungrateful, unholy, heartless, unappeasable,
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:37.640]   "slanderous, without self-control, brutal,
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.160]   "not loving good, treacherous, reckless,
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.060]   "swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:42.580]   "rather than lovers of God."
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.880]   Listen to this.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.460]   All of that sounds so terrible, right?
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:48.140]   But listen to verse five.
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:52.540]   "Having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power."
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.980]   And it says, "Avoid such people."
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:56.840]   It continues in chapter four, verse three to four.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.840]   Listen to this.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.320]   "For the time is coming when people
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.980]   "will not endure sound teaching,
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.900]   "but having itching ears, they will accumulate
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:06.580]   "for themselves teachers to suit their own passions,
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.780]   "and will turn away from listening to the truth
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.500]   "and wander off into myths."
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.740]   Now if you go to Revelation chapter 11,
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.220]   and you see this beast that kind of comes out
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:20.340]   from this bottomless pit, it says that he's gonna make war
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.620]   on these two witnesses and conquer them and kill them.
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.220]   These two witnesses are people
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:27.700]   who are speaking the truth of God.
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.860]   And here comes this antichrist,
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:33.580]   who comes and says the exact opposite in deceptive ways.
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:36.820]   He is going to look extremely attractive,
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.180]   even to very, very religious people.
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:47.060]   And we need to learn as a church to beware of this.
[00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.540]   That's why we need to know our doctrine.
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.660]   That's why we need to understand what we believe.
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:54.600]   That's why you need to know scripture.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.900]   Not just the basics of like, you know,
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:00.180]   like I think somewhere in the Bible it says something
[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:02.820]   about, you know, stealing is wrong.
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:06.020]   But really understanding where and why
[00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.540]   we believe these things.
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:10.580]   That we need to be, if you want to be able to fight off
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:13.980]   the attacks, the false prophets, the antichrist spirits
[00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:17.580]   against the church, you need to be very sharp
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:19.020]   in these things.
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.520]   And so pursue that on your own.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.580]   Don't let it become a daily exercise of just reading a text
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:27.660]   and thinking like, I'm gonna take out one application.
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:31.140]   But dive deeply into it and begin to dissect scripture
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.500]   and see what God would have to say to us.
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.740]   That we might be approved workmen.
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:38.580]   That we might know how to go, you know,
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:40.500]   if we go into evangelizing on campus
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.340]   or like a Jehovah's Witness comes to you.
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:44.140]   I know some people have said that, like,
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:45.500]   like I don't know what to say to them.
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.920]   You know, they came and threw all this Bible at me
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.460]   and I was like, oh man, I was a little bit ashamed.
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.940]   But to really know these things,
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:56.140]   we need to be able to know the truth of God.
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.260]   And so what does this beast do?
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:01.620]   This beast kills them and it says that their bodies
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.700]   are left down in the street of the great city.
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:04.780]   Now the next bullet point down there,
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:06.880]   the great city refers to Jerusalem,
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.300]   since that is where he was crucified.
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:16.380]   And the fact that Jerusalem is called Sodom in Egypt
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:19.820]   shows the extent of wickedness that has consumed the world.
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.540]   Jerusalem is the holy city.
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:24.180]   This is headquarters.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:27.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:31.260]   It's called Sodom.
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:33.940]   If you know that story of Sodom and Gomorrah,
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:37.240]   terrible, wicked city in Egypt.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:43.980]   This was a nation that was known for its heinous darkness
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:48.200]   and religious acts.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:55.080]   Next bullet point down there,
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.940]   the fact that they're left there for a few days
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.920]   before being resurrected shows something.
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:01.000]   They have been pouring out God's judgment message
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.840]   to the world, accompanied by miracles and terrors,
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:07.060]   yet people's hearts were still hardened.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.720]   Isn't it crazy that people can see
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:24.000]   the powerful work of God and still not believe in him?
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.700]   And as we've been talking, isn't it amazing
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:31.460]   that we ourselves have seen the power of God's work?
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:34.000]   We know who God is and how powerful he is,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.520]   but our own hearts are prone to be the same way
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:38.960]   and it's hard-heartedness.
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:42.480]   And so what God does in verse 11 and 12,
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.520]   if you look at the text, it says,
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:45.920]   but after the three and a half days,
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.600]   a breath of life from God entered them
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:48.960]   and they stood up on their feet
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.240]   and great fear fell on those who saw them.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.200]   Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them,
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.080]   come up here.
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.200]   And they went up to heaven in a cloud.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.280]   And listen to this, this is just a funny sight, right?
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.680]   Their enemies were watching.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:04.960]   Three and a half days, they were leaving their bodies out.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.920]   And if you read carefully at this text,
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.040]   it says that they were exchanging presents with each other.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:09.880]   You know what they were doing?
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.080]   They made it into a holiday.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:15.000]   And for all this time, these two witnesses
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.960]   were talking about God and everyone was like,
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.720]   oh, stop talking about this God.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:20.760]   We don't want to hear.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.400]   They're plugging their ears and gritting their teeth
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.400]   and saying, we don't want you.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.840]   And so they're trying to kill these guys
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.440]   and they're not dying.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.920]   And so finally, when this beast comes out and kills them,
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:34.840]   first of all, the beast becomes this mythical person, right?
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.320]   Man, this is the person, he did it.
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:38.360]   He got to these guys.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.240]   In three and a half days, they just leave him there
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:43.200]   celebrating the death of these two men.
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:48.760]   And then they rise from the dead.
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.640]   And not only that, but the enemies are watching them
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.320]   float up into heaven just the way Jesus left
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.160]   and the way Jesus will return.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:02.560]   It says after that in verse 13 to 14,
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.200]   "And at that hour, there was a great earthquake
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.680]   "and a tent of the city fell.
[00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.440]   "7,000 people were killed in the earthquake
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.840]   "and the rest were terrified and gave glory
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.000]   "to the God of heaven."
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:17.560]   This is not to say, and this is one of your bullet points,
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.680]   that they repented.
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:23.520]   This is clear from the text.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.560]   They simply gave glory to where it was due.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.800]   They had no choice.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:37.040]   And that bullet point there is you can acknowledge
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:41.920]   God's power and might and yet stay unrepentant and rebellious.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:44.080]   I was trying to think of examples of this.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:49.320]   I don't know if you guys were into the whole
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.600]   Harry Potter series and stuff,
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:53.680]   but somewhere in that story, there's a guiding,
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:55.240]   there's this house elf.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.080]   And these house elves are like the servants
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.480]   of these wizards.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:02.160]   This house elf's name is Creature.
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:05.640]   It's spelled like preacher with a K.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:09.960]   And so he's there and then the old masters
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.320]   of the house are gone.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:14.760]   This was an evil household.
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.920]   There were just bad wizards, there were dark wizards
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.800]   and things like that.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.480]   But there was a black sheep of the family.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:22.840]   A black sheep of an evil family would be a good sheep.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.880]   So there's a black sheep there.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:27.280]   And because everybody else is gone
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.520]   and he's the only one remaining,
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:32.600]   this little house elf is like his servant.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:33.680]   And he has to do whatever he says.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:37.240]   But it's so funny that this house elf is walking around
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.360]   and he has to do whatever this guy says,
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.400]   this wizard says.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.640]   Wizard says, "Go clean that up."
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.560]   He has to go and clean it up.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:43.840]   But everywhere he's going,
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.640]   he's muttering under his breath.
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.720]   "You filthy wizard, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.680]   Everything he does, he does it begrudgingly.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:55.360]   Everything he does, he's muttering under his breath
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.160]   and he's doing it hatefully.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.960]   And it's such a funny picture.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.280]   And yet I think it's a good picture
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.560]   of what a hard heart can look like
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.400]   when it sees and acknowledges God's power and might
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.320]   and yet stays unrepentant and rebellious.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:16.160]   I have a friend who,
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:19.760]   it's so sad when I think about it,
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:24.760]   but he was extremely sexually active in college,
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.480]   extremely sexually active.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.240]   And he later on ended up getting married
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.320]   and committing adultery
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.760]   and then continued on in that kind of lifestyle.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:37.760]   And as he was living like that,
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:40.880]   because of his lifestyle, he contracted AIDS
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.880]   and he lost everything.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:47.200]   Like he's estranged, not just from his ex-wife,
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:51.920]   but his kids who he loved a lot because of his lifestyle.
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:53.600]   And what's crazy is,
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:56.720]   the last time I talked to him about six years ago,
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.960]   he was saying like, "You know,
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:02.280]   "I think God is doing this to teach me a lesson."
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.000]   And then he said, he was like saying like,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.200]   "Yeah, God is definitely,
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:07.600]   "it's so clear that God is showing me all these things."
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.120]   And he said something so striking
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.160]   at the end of our conversation.
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.360]   He said, "I hate God."
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:15.120]   And it's this understanding,
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.320]   I think this is the type of people
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.520]   that we're seeing here in verse 13.
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:21.680]   That people see and are terrified
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.400]   and they gave glory to the God of heaven
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.120]   and yet their hearts remain unrepentant
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.960]   and unsubmissive to God.
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.400]   Now verse 14 at the bottom,
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.200]   before we get into the seventh trumpet,
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.280]   the second woe has passed,
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.440]   behold the third woe is soon to come.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:38.840]   If you remember the first woe was,
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:43.240]   the first two woes, wait, hold on.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.160]   The second woe has passed,
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.960]   behold the third woe is soon to come.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.520]   It was trumpets five and six.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:49.920]   Okay, those were the first two woes.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.440]   And remember, there are three woes.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.920]   And so everything that's gonna happen
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.160]   with the unleashing of the seventh trumpet,
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:57.360]   namely the seven bowls of wrath
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:00.200]   that are gonna be taken out in a few chapters,
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:02.760]   that is the seventh woe that we're seeing here.
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:09.080]   So two, trumpet number seven.
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:10.520]   And this part goes fast.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:14.200]   Trumpet number seven, it says in verse 15,
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.640]   then the seventh angel blew his trumpet
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.400]   and there were loud voices in heaven saying,
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.120]   the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.240]   of our Lord and of his Christ
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.880]   and he shall reign forever and ever.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.920]   And the 24 elders who sits on their thrones
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.880]   before God fell on their faces and worshiped God.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.880]   Now what happens here, the kingdom of the world, it says,
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.240]   has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.160]   That means that God reclaims his world.
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.360]   God reclaims the world.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:41.240]   And again, we see these elders worshiping
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.760]   and falling before the throne.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:46.440]   Remember, that's all we saw in chapters four and five.
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:47.880]   It's happening again.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:48.880]   And the next bullet point down,
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.240]   though there are many kingdoms in the world,
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.280]   they are described as being one kingdom.
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.440]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:56.680]   So it's the kingdom of the world.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.800]   It should say the kingdoms of the world, right?
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.440]   But it says the kingdom, singular,
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:04.320]   showing that there might be many beliefs in this world.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:10.520]   It could be Catholicism or atheism or Hinduism,
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:15.080]   but at the end, they are all of the same kingdom,
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.760]   rebellious against God.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.800]   There are only two camps.
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:21.000]   It's either God's kingdom or it's the kingdom of this world.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.640]   And it says that kingdom of the world
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:25.880]   has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ.
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.720]   God reclaims the world.
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.320]   Third bullet point, has become.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.160]   This is called a proleptic heiress.
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:38.000]   And we're not trying to just be intellectual here,
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.560]   but proleptic heiress is a really interesting,
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:43.920]   interesting grammatical choice here by John.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.040]   And this is a future event that is so certain
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:51.160]   that it can be spoken of as already having taken place.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.800]   So heiress is past tense.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.040]   Okay, sorry, I forgot to mention that.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.160]   Heir is this past tense.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:58.680]   So it's so strong.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:51:59.920]   And basically what this means is that
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.680]   it's only a matter of time for this certain conclusion.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:06.880]   Emphasizing that this will happen.
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:10.400]   So strongly that's used in the past tense.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:19.840]   Verse 17 and 18 says,
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.440]   "We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty,
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:23.640]   "who is and who was, for you have taken your great power
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.680]   "and begun to reign.
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.520]   "The nations raged, but your wrath came,
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:28.200]   "and the time for the dead to be judged,
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:30.520]   "and for rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints,
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:32.600]   "and those who fear your name, both small and great,
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.480]   "and for destroying the destroyers of the earth."
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.480]   The bullet point there is God reigns in his sovereignty today
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:41.960]   but the fullness of his reign is to come during this time.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.920]   Again, another proleptic heiress there.
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:44.960]   Your wrath came.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.800]   Your wrath came.
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.480]   The dead will be judged.
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:55.480]   And it says two things.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:53:00.240]   Servants will be rewarded, and enemies will be destroyed.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.360]   Don't lose that, by the way,
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.920]   that fact that servants will be rewarded.
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:05.240]   That's gonna be happen.
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:07.760]   When people say like, "Your reward is in heaven,"
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.760]   we always think about it as like, "Ah, that's a cop-out,"
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:10.600]   you know, that kind of thing.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:12.160]   But totally, it's true.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.640]   And trust me, if your rewards are stored in heaven,
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.200]   when you go up there and you see your rewards,
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.200]   you're gonna be like, "Oh my goodness.
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:22.480]   "That was awesome."
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.520]   I did that with my youth a lot, you know?
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:27.640]   Like, I would give them like hot Cheetos
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:29.080]   or like chocolate and things like that.
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.400]   But sometimes I would forget to buy it.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.800]   So I'd be like, "Don't worry, your reward's in heaven."
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:33.640]   They'd go, "Ah!"
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.680]   And we're like that.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.760]   But it says here specifically,
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:41.640]   "Rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints."
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:42.680]   Be excited for that.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:46.360]   It's not wrong to desire rewards of heaven.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:48.520]   It's actually a very noble thing to pursue.
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:51.880]   It is interesting that even though
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:53.560]   it seems like God was destroying the earth,
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:56.160]   it is actually humanity that is being accused
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.640]   of the earth's destruction.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:02.360]   Did you see that at the end of verse 18?
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:04.960]   "Destroying the destroyers of the earth."
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:09.840]   God needs to destroy sinners in order to save the world.
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:13.160]   You know, we think we need to save the world, right?
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:17.160]   Like socially, politically, economically, racially.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.800]   And we think we're saving it by recycling
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:19.640]   and things like that.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.040]   It's true, it's good stuff to do.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.320]   But actually, we're being accused
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.920]   as being destroyers of the world,
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.800]   and only the gospel can save it.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:31.600]   Let's go to the last bullet point there.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:33.160]   The seventh trumpet concludes again
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:37.320]   with lightning, rumblings, thunder, earthquakes, and hail.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:39.400]   We see that in verse 19.
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:40.720]   And remember where that comes from.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.040]   It's coming directly from the throne room of God,
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:45.000]   that God is reminding us again here
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.400]   where all of this stuff is coming from.
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:51.440]   Because what we're gonna see coming up now
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.600]   is the worst of it.
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:56.320]   So we think everything is like so bad, but here we go.
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.960]   From here on forward,
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:00.720]   we're going to see some crazy stuff happening.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:05.040]   But it's also going to be mixed with a lot more joy.
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.080]   Why?
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:09.080]   Because we're seeing a lot of victory happening.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.840]   God is beginning to show us the victory
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:15.040]   of the angels that we'll be seeing,
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.440]   of his kingdom that's gonna be descending.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:19.800]   We're gonna be seeing so much of the fact
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.720]   that God is redeeming his people.
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:24.360]   I wanna remind us of that.
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:29.040]   I feel like we have to kind of go through Psalm 2
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:31.800]   to end this, so can you turn with me to Psalm chapter 2?
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:36.480]   Psalm chapter 2.
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:45.960]   And I know we weren't deeply able
[00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:49.240]   to go into that revelation, the song sung.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:52.560]   But it reminded me of this Psalm.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:55.800]   Psalm chapter 2, verse 1, it says,
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:59.880]   "Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:01.800]   "The kings of the earth set themselves,
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:04.120]   "and the rulers, they come together,"
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.840]   it says, "they take counsel together
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.440]   "against the Lord and against his anointed, saying,
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:12.520]   "Let us burst their bonds apart
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:15.640]   "and cast away their courts from us."
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:17.520]   The world, you see this?
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:19.000]   It's like these little ants getting together
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.440]   and saying, like pip squeaks, right?
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.720]   Pip squeaks, speaking up at God, saying,
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.520]   "Hey, let's all get together and try to take him down."
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:30.040]   Verse 4, "He who sits in the heavens laughs.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:33.120]   "The Lord holds them in derision.
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:36.960]   "Then he will speak to them in his wrath
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.480]   "and terrify them in his fury, saying,
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:43.720]   "As for me, I have set my king on Zion, my holy hill.
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:46.800]   "I will tell of the decree the Lord said to me,
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:50.120]   "You are my son, today I have begotten you."
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.440]   He's talking to Christ here.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:54.200]   "Ask of me and I will make the nations your heritage
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.840]   "and the ends of the earth your possession."
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:58.240]   You see this, the reclamation of the earth.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.200]   "You shall break them with a rod of iron,
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.400]   "dash them into pieces like a potter's vessel."
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.400]   You see the wrath of God happening here.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:08.040]   Verse 10, "Now therefore, O kings, be wise.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:10.120]   "Be warned, O rulers of the earth.
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:13.840]   "Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling.
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:17.520]   "Kiss the Son lest he be angry and you perish in the way,
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:19.760]   "for his wrath is quickly kindled.
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:22.160]   "Blessed are all who take refuge in him."
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:26.880]   Let's remember what's happening here in Revelation.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:30.080]   As the wrath of God is being unleashed upon the earth,
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:33.200]   that today again, God is showing
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:36.440]   that there is time for repentance
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.040]   and there is time for us now to serve the Lord with fear
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:41.280]   and rejoice with trembling, to kiss the Son.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:47.040]   Not try to live our own lives the way we've called it to.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.320]   And especially as believers,
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:51.880]   I hope that we don't mimic the world,
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.680]   that we don't say, "I'm going to live for myself,"
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:55.840]   that God truly is our King.
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:57.240]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.800]   Dear God, we thank you for this book of Revelation
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.560]   that continues to remind us,
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:20.160]   like a hammer, it's just nailing us down
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:21.560]   into this understanding,
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:26.600]   firmer and firmer in the coming judgment,
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:31.000]   in the wrath that you're gonna unleash upon this world.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.740]   And yet in the middle of that, Father, we cry, thank you.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:40.160]   I cry, thank you to you that you have sent your Son
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:43.760]   as your grace and mercy upon this world,
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:46.080]   that whoever would call upon the name of the Lord
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:47.220]   would be saved.
[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:52.360]   And that as this hammer is being nailed down in us,
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.400]   as we see our wrath,
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:57.200]   that constantly we would be looking to Christ on the cross
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:00.040]   and again and again, remembering the gravity of our sin
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:02.200]   and what was done on behalf of us.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:07.200]   And then our hearts and our eyes would turn to the throne
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:10.000]   and that we would fall down on our knees and worship,
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.300]   not only a wrathful and just God,
[00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:14.800]   but one who would rescue us
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:18.180]   by sending his very own Son to die for us.
[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:20.740]   So thank you, Lord.
[00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:23.160]   Would our songs be songs of response,
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.840]   of worship towards you
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:28.000]   because of your power and your grace.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.660]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:31.660]   Thank you.
