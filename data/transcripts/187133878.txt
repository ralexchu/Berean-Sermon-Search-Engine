[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Hi everybody.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   We're gonna jump right into our Bible study today.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.320]   And today I don't have a PowerPoint for us.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.280]   We're gonna be walking through a big,
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.200]   like many chunks of scripture.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.080]   So please get your Bibles handy.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.800]   And by way of kind of wrapping things
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.440]   and connecting the dots of what we've been studying.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.160]   We've been studying about having a high view of God, right?
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.040]   And another way you can phrase that is,
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.200]   we've been studying about the holiness,
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.200]   the character traits, you know, the aspect of who God is.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.660]   And another way you can phrase that is,
[00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.840]   we've been just studying an accurate view of God.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.520]   We've been seeing, we've been trying to see him as he is.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.480]   And how that's effective or how that affects
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.560]   our personal lives and our corporate lives as well, okay?
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.720]   So the idea is to see God in a high way
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.520]   is essentially to see him in an accurate way.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.480]   And I wanna use this term accuracy
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.520]   to emphasize what we're gonna be talking about today.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.720]   Because in order to have an accurate view of God,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.800]   we absolutely have to have an accurate view
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.620]   of the word of God, right?
[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.720]   We have to have an accurate understanding of the scriptures.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.200]   And so today's main question is going to be,
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.520]   how do you view scripture, right?
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.720]   Now, there is just a basic question of how we ought to view,
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.940]   we should view scriptures highly.
[00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.340]   Just as we view God highly,
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.400]   we need to view the scriptures highly.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.680]   But I hope that today would be an evaluation very deeply
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.800]   about your own personal heart and your faith
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.640]   of how you view the word of the Lord.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.440]   The interesting thing about the word of God
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.280]   is that in a tangible humanistic sense,
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.760]   what we have before us is a book, right?
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.520]   Like many others.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.400]   Other religions have scriptures.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.700]   In a secular way, in a secular fashion,
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.800]   humanistically speaking, we have a collection of writing
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.280]   that's been handed down,
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.040]   just like many other books are handed down.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.240]   And so the unbelieving world sees the scriptures
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.460]   like this is scripture.
[00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.080]   Yes, it's sacred.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.480]   Yes, people revere it, but it's just writing.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.280]   We might call it perhaps a collection of quotes.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.240]   We might call it perhaps a collection of moral teaching,
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.760]   whatever it may be, but for us,
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.040]   we see the scriptures in an entirely different light, right?
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.480]   Through faith, we see the reality that what we have
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.160]   is not simply the collection of old sayings.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.520]   What we have is not simply a collection of tradition.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.960]   When we say, and we actually,
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.320]   we refer to the text that we have,
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.080]   we call it the word of God.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.220]   And by faith, what we're saying is this is the voice
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.080]   of the God we've been trying to see more accurately.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.260]   Does that make sense?
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.320]   And so as we think about that,
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.080]   we have to ask this question.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.880]   How do we view and treat the sacred scriptures,
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.480]   the word of God, the voice of the Lord?
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.480]   And for your blank there, as an introductory way of saying,
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.580]   how you treat the word of God is indicative
[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.400]   of how you treat God himself.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   Okay, let me repeat that.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.040]   How you treat the word of God is indicative
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.880]   of how you treat God himself.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.920]   Should you neglect?
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.080]   Should you cherish?
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.720]   Should you love?
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.680]   Should you be in tune with?
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.520]   Whatever the relational term there is between you
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.560]   and his word is going to be indicative
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.560]   of your relationship directly with God himself.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.700]   And so today, again, we're gonna be diving deep
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.560]   into how we are to then relate to the scriptures.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.340]   Let's take a moment to pray as we jump into this study.
[00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.360]   Our God, we pray now, Lord,
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.940]   that we would all be granted attentiveness
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.620]   and God, a heart that's desiring to learn.
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.340]   Father God, I pray that by your spirit,
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.100]   you would continue just to do your work of conviction.
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.140]   God, that through faith, we might be able
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.820]   to have such a deep-rooted devotion to go to your truth,
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.820]   to desire, to regularly take of what you have to teach us.
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.700]   And God, would you be with those of us
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.860]   who perhaps are tired tonight after a long days of work
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.160]   that you grant to us continued strength
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.860]   and attention and alertness.
[00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.380]   Father, we lift this time to you.
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.420]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.180]   Okay, the route that we're gonna take tonight
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.460]   is again, centering on this idea
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.660]   of how we should view, how we should treat
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.540]   and relate to the word of God.
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.600]   And the way we're gonna take is take major stories
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.300]   from the Old Testament and different parts of scripture
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.420]   to talk about that issue.
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.300]   First, turn your Bibles over to Jeremiah chapter 23,
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.820]   verse 28 through 32.
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.940]   Okay, Jeremiah chapter 23, verse 28 through 32.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.220]   As you turn there, I'm gonna set the stage a bit here.
[00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.700]   And the time is the reign of Josiah, okay, Josiah.
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.620]   Josiah came at a very interesting time
[00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.140]   because the previous kings before him,
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.660]   they were engaged in a power struggle, okay.
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.740]   And what happens in that power struggle
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.580]   is there were assassinations of the kings before him.
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.580]   So, Josiah actually began to rule at age eight.
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.020]   Can you imagine that?
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.380]   Eight years old and he was beginning to rule.
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.540]   Josiah had a lengthy reign, over 30 years, okay.
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.260]   So he actually sat on the throne
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.820]   of the nation of Judah for a long time.
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.020]   During that time, the primary prophet
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.440]   that was to come and speak was Jeremiah, okay.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.100]   Before King Josiah and after King Josiah,
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.100]   the landscape was dismal because there was so much
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.100]   neglect of the word of God and there was so much idolatry
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.100]   and so much, as you would say,
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.300]   of just simply going astray from worship of God.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.820]   And to that kind of context, Jeremiah's coming in
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.820]   and speaking the word of God, okay.
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.900]   So, let me read from verse 28 down to verse 32
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.500]   and it says this.
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.700]   Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream,
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.700]   but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully.
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.580]   What has straw in common with wheat, declares the Lord,
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.180]   is not my word like fire, declares the Lord,
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.160]   and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.260]   Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets,
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.100]   declares the Lord, who steal my words from one another.
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.580]   Behold, I am against the prophets, declares the Lord,
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.140]   who use their tongues and declare, declares the Lord.
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.140]   Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams,
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.060]   declares the Lord, and who tells them
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.220]   and lead my people astray by their lies
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.540]   and their recklessness.
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.460]   When I did not send them or charge them,
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.940]   so they do not profit this people at all,
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.180]   declares the Lord.
[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.260]   So, here's a specific segment in which Jeremiah
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.420]   is rebuking, right, the tone is clearly very rebuking,
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.780]   but he's rebuking the people because they're speaking
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.820]   of stuff that God never told them to say.
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:25.220]   There is a twisting, there is false teaching,
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.780]   and to this generation, Jeremiah is telling them
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.020]   that they need to turn around from this kind of falsehood
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.100]   and that God is absolutely displeased
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.660]   with what they're doing.
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.040]   So, specifically speaking, when he's rebuking them,
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.480]   there is a verse he kind of highlights
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.180]   as to what they are doing, and it is verse 29
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:49.820]   when he says, "Is not my word like fire and like a hammer?"
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.780]   The entire generation fails to understand
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.120]   the nature of God's word.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.220]   They fail to understand the intensity of God's word.
[00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.340]   They fail to understand the power of God's word.
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.220]   And so, that's gonna be our first point for us.
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.140]   It's a simple point, that the word of the Lord is powerful.
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:14.720]   The blank there, the word of the Lord is powerful.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.420]   Now, what I'm gonna do for you really quickly here
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:23.420]   is I could go on and on about different case examples
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.100]   of how God's word is so powerful, okay?
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.520]   And kind of like in a boxing match,
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.720]   somebody who throws lots of little jabs,
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.800]   we're gonna look at a bunch of verses
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:38.520]   that point to how powerful the word of God is, okay?
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.400]   So, first, the first blank you have there,
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.600]   the word of the Lord is eternal, okay, eternal.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.400]   Scripture says, both in the New and Old Testament,
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.820]   in Matthew 24, it says, "Heaven and earth will pass away,
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.900]   "but my words will never pass away."
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:00.800]   Okay, number two, the word of God is powerful to create.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.220]   I don't have to even reference the passages there,
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.520]   but with powerful words, God spoke into existence
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.580]   things that never were.
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.800]   In Latin, it's the idea of ex nihilos,
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.620]   it's that out of nothing,
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.960]   God was able to speak things into existence.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.880]   Next, God's word is powerful to transform, transform.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.740]   In 1 Peter 1, verse 23, it says,
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.900]   "For you have been born, not of perishable seed,
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.820]   "but of imperishable, through the living
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.200]   "and enduring word of God."
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.700]   Okay, you've been born again.
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.640]   Number four, God's word is powerful to judge.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:47.480]   He is the one who declares and calls things as it is,
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.820]   and his word declares things either righteous
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.800]   or unrighteous.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:58.060]   Next, God's word is powerful to produce
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.840]   its intended purpose.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.580]   Scripture teaches us that God's word never goes out
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.620]   and then returns void, but rather, it says here
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.220]   that it will not return to me empty,
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.540]   but will accomplish what I desire
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.820]   and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.900]   Number six, the word of God is powerful to equip.
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.540]   It has power to equip.
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.380]   That it is capable of correcting us,
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.820]   it is capable of training us,
[00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.340]   and it's capable of presenting us complete
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.580]   so that we'd be equipped for every good work.
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.660]   So, we just went through kind of what you call
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.260]   a laundry list, right?
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.340]   Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.900]   And I hope, you know, I didn't make you guys
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.380]   feel too flustered trying to fill in
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.100]   all the little blanks.
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.700]   But the idea is, we could just keep going
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.480]   on and on and on and on.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.760]   A classic passage that I had you guys read
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.300]   for one of your devotions is a passage
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.580]   in Psalm chapter 19.
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.520]   Let's turn there.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.120]   Psalm chapter 19, verse seven through 14.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:08.620]   And I believe as we just go down this list
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.740]   of the various attributes and power
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.020]   that the word of God contains,
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.000]   that it would be safe for us to conclude
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.300]   God's word is perfect in power.
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.300]   Take a look at this passage.
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.220]   It says, "The law of the Lord is perfect,
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.180]   "reviving the soul.
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.840]   "The testimony of the Lord is sure,
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.080]   "making wise the simple.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.580]   "The precepts of the Lord are right,
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.140]   "rejoicing the heart.
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.240]   "The commandments of the Lord is pure.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.620]   "It enlightens the eyes.
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.080]   "The fear of the Lord is clean,
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.400]   "enduring forever.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.880]   "The rules of the Lord are true
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.700]   "and righteous altogether.
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.460]   "More to be desired are they than gold,
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.700]   "even much fine gold,
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:45.960]   "sweeter also than honey
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.740]   "and drippings of the honeycomb.
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.320]   "Moreover, by them is your servant warned.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.860]   "In keeping them, there is great reward."
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.420]   Right?
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.340]   So as we think about this for a moment,
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.220]   let's just take some time to just
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.380]   kind of grapple with that laundry list
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.740]   we just went through.
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.060]   We can sit there and doctrinally go through
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.740]   so many different passages,
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.220]   so many different proofs of the fact
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.100]   that God's word is absolutely powerful.
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.660]   But the question to us, for us to ponder
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.340]   and then evaluate our heart,
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.220]   is do you believe it?
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:22.940]   Do you believe God's word to be powerful?
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.540]   And for all of us, I know we're gonna answer
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.500]   that yes or no question with,
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.160]   yes I do.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.000]   Right?
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.740]   I believe God's word to be God's word.
[00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.500]   I believe God's word to be inspired.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.180]   We went through that in BCC.
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.540]   I signed off on it on my membership covenant
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.340]   and we talk about it all the time.
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.220]   I believe it.
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.700]   But now here's a follow up question to that.
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.220]   To what degree?
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.980]   Right?
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.120]   I think one of the great things for us
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.860]   in going through a review of some of these
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.940]   foundational doctrines,
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:01.340]   is it challenges my concept in terms of degrees.
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.740]   I believe God's holy,
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.780]   but I am reminded when I review
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.500]   the depth of his holiness,
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.380]   the extent of his righteousness,
[00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.580]   the purity, that concept is huge.
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:14.780]   Right?
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.980]   Likewise today as we review this doctrine
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.660]   of God's word being sure, perfect and powerful,
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.100]   my question to you is,
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.460]   in your grasp of the truth,
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:28.460]   to what degree do you believe God's word to be powerful?
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.880]   And another way I can ask that question,
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.380]   is do you believe God's word to be powerful
[00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.620]   to the degree that it grasps your attention?
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:42.420]   That it demands your focus?
[00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.900]   A little illustration to highlight that is this.
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:52.300]   Back when I was playing basketball in high school,
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.940]   I played basketball in high school, believe it or not.
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.780]   I'm not very good, but I played.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.800]   But I was so bad that as a sophomore
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.180]   I was on the freshman team.
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.820]   They had pity on me and said,
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.140]   you can play on the freshman team, right?
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.360]   Anyway, I had a lot of fun.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.780]   I wasn't very good, but I had a lot of fun
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.600]   because I was a scrappy player.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.820]   I tried hard.
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.620]   So back when I was a sophomore,
[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.500]   I thought I was huge 'cause I had an early growth spurt.
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.020]   Everybody else was still kinda shorter
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.040]   and some kids are taller,
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.980]   but I had an early growth spurt
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.100]   and I thought I was huge,
[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.340]   so I would typically get a lot of rebounds.
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:28.300]   When during one of the practices,
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.780]   I went up for a rebound,
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.340]   another guy kinda grabbed it
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.180]   and then he did the thing where he threw his shoulder.
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.420]   I got so upset.
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.700]   I completely lost it.
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.660]   Like I didn't see anything in my world except just him.
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:43.100]   I grabbed the ball and I kinda bumped him with my hip
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.900]   and I almost picked him up off the ground.
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.180]   And then we started rolling on the floor
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.460]   and we were going all scrappy
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.600]   and then I could hear everybody's like,
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.260]   stop, stop, stop, stop.
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.940]   And then, you know, like the guy who I was wrestling,
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.580]   he's like, stop, stop, knock it off.
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.340]   And I was like, you stop.
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.580]   And we were just going at it
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.300]   and then I hear the coach like right in my ear.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.620]   I didn't realize he ran up on the court
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.020]   and was yelling in my ear.
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:05.860]   (grunting)
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:06.680]   I was like.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.520]   (laughing)
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.780]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.780]   The reason why I give you that analogy
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.180]   is because there are competing voices.
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.700]   There are my teammates yelling, stop, stop, stop.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.420]   There's the guy in front of me who,
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.780]   obviously I'm not gonna listen to him.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.980]   He's like, get off, get off, get off.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.060]   But then as soon as I hear my coach's voice,
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.460]   what do I do?
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.580]   Right?
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.220]   That's how we are when we're kids
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:29.140]   and we're messing around
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:29.980]   and then, you know,
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:30.820]   our papa comes in, we're like,
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:31.660]   dude, he did it.
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:32.620]   You know, like,
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.180]   the voice of somebody who is an authoritative figure
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.500]   demands attention.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.020]   But the thing about it is we have to ask ourselves,
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:45.020]   to what degree does God's word demand my attention?
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:48.700]   Because that degree is going to be indicative
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.020]   of how much I believe that voice is powerful.
[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.200]   Right?
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.940]   Does it demand that kind of attention from you
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.060]   in this world where there are so many
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.380]   competing voices in our lives?
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.180]   Are there competing voices in our lives?
[00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.020]   Yes.
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.700]   There's your voice.
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.020]   There's the voice of the people
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.700]   who you give a lot of credit to.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.140]   There's the voice of the world.
[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:12.540]   There's the voice of Satan.
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.900]   There's the voice of the culture and the generation
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.100]   of their expectation.
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.460]   They're telling you what they wanna see in you.
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.980]   But my question is,
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:27.300]   to what degree does God's voice have power in your life?
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.900]   Above and beyond those other voices.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.740]   Right?
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.300]   Now, as we think about that,
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:39.420]   my main point there is God's word is powerful.
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:43.740]   And it demands that kind of attention in our lives.
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.700]   But the second point is gonna be that God also demands
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.020]   such attention to his word.
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.860]   Can we please all go over to Deuteronomy chapter 28,
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.460]   verse one through six?
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:57.620]   Okay?
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:58.500]   And as you turn there,
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.860]   I wanna give you a little bit of context here too.
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.820]   I wanna say this to you guys that
[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:08.340]   the book of Deuteronomy is so crucial.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.460]   I mean, all of the scripture is so crucial.
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.620]   But the book of Deuteronomy stands out
[00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:17.420]   as one of these extra important books of the Bible
[00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:22.300]   that gives you a focus of what God expects from the nation.
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.140]   Why?
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.700]   Because remember, this whole story is
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.260]   they do the disobedience thing
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.780]   and not trusting God to go into the promised land.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.940]   So then God makes them wander for 40 years.
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.540]   They go through a whole lot of losing
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:35.740]   a lot of their loved ones,
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.460]   losing almost an entire generation of people.
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.500]   And then they go through a lot of ups and downs,
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.660]   lot of downs really.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.140]   And then they come to the point
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.620]   where they're on the plains of Moab
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.500]   looking into the land of Canaan,
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.900]   expecting like, oh my gosh,
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.060]   we're gonna finally get to go.
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.220]   Right?
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.460]   The book of Deuteronomy is a repeat of,
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.140]   like it's basically a review.
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:58.980]   Where Moses is saying,
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.860]   everybody, we've got this second chance
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.580]   and we need to focus, right?
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.540]   And all of the book of Deuteronomy is
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.640]   Moses reviewing with the people,
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.580]   this is how God has treated you,
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.340]   this is what God taught you,
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.220]   this is the law you better obey.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:20.900]   And chapter 28 is a pivotal one in that type of teaching.
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.160]   Let's take a look at verse one through six.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.580]   Moses says, "Now it shall be,
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.500]   "if you diligently obey the Lord your God,
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.940]   "being careful to do all his commandments
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.580]   "which I command you today,
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.680]   "the Lord your God will set you high
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.800]   "above all the nations of the earth.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.060]   "All these blessings will come upon you
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.900]   "and overtake you if you obey the Lord your God."
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.420]   And then he goes down on a laundry list of blessings.
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.940]   What's his main point here?
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.640]   If you obey, right?
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.660]   But then the scary part comes in verse 15
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.940]   of that same chapter, chapter 28, verse 15.
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:01.940]   He says, "But it shall come about
[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.500]   "if you do not obey the Lord your God,
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.080]   "to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.740]   "which I charge you today,
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.700]   "that all these curses will come upon you and overtake you.
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.620]   "Curse shall you be in the city
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.820]   "and curse shall you be in the country.
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.380]   "Curse shall your basket and your kneading bowl.
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.200]   "Curse shall be the offspring of your body
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.700]   "and the produce of your ground,
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.220]   "the increase of your herd and the young of your flock."
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.720]   And then he just goes on.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:33.360]   And the curses are incredibly sobering, right?
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.480]   What is his emphasis here?
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.480]   His emphasis is there is a huge, huge ramification
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.680]   of this one single point
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:48.200]   that you heed and be careful to do all that I say.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.160]   And your success is going to be entirely dependent
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.120]   upon how you obey.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:58.920]   And should you not obey, the consequences are real, right?
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:05.300]   And what's more, not only was God making sure
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.080]   that before the nation went into the land of Canaan
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.780]   that he made sure he sat them down
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.600]   and reminded them of this,
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.720]   he made sure that before the nation actually started
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.560]   to conquer other nations and follow a new leader,
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.560]   he said the exact same thing.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.000]   For the sake of time, I'll read this for us.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.760]   It's Joshua chapter one, verse eight.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.640]   This is what he says.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:29.640]   "This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth,
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.820]   "but you shall meditate on it day and night
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.280]   "so that you may be careful to do according
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.280]   "to all that it is written.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.240]   "For then you will make your way prosperous
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.040]   "and then you shall have good success."
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.600]   So the whole idea here is point two.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.600]   God commands us to hear and obey his voice carefully.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.400]   Right?
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.160]   The whole idea is listen carefully
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.120]   so that you might know what he says
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.520]   and then you might do what he says carefully.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.000]   That's what he said throughout the book of Deuteronomy.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.480]   That's what he said throughout the rest of the books
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.520]   of the Bible.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.520]   And then the nation that he raised up,
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.200]   the nation of Israel, they were set on this.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.600]   You know that from an early age,
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.400]   the Jewish people would teach their children
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.160]   to read, read, read, memorize, memorize, memorize.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.040]   Have you guys heard of the frontlets?
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.360]   I was gonna show you a funny photo.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.360]   But basically it's a box that you put right here.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.360]   Okay?
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.720]   And then they have little basically placards in there
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.960]   with certain references so that they could take it out.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.080]   Essentially it's a box reminding them
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.840]   that the word of God is here.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.080]   And they had these bands, these leather bands
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.560]   that they had the word of God written on
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.760]   and they'd wrap their arm, it would look like a warrior
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.480]   but what it was really was the word of the Lord.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.040]   And do you remember in Deuteronomy chapter six
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:55.880]   what he says?
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.520]   He says, "Hear, O Israel," and then he says,
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.560]   "You shall obey my commandments."
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.080]   He said, "You teach them to your children
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.400]   "and you shall write them on your doorposts."
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.840]   So if you grew up in one of those homes
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.120]   where they had this wooden plaque
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.440]   and it had Bible verses on it,
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.240]   that's how the nation of Israel grew up.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.560]   They had Bible verses all over their house.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.160]   To that degree, the word of God was supposed
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.800]   to saturate the lives of his people.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.100]   Right?
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.720]   My point here in talking about this
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.900]   is I want us to kind of, not kind of,
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.560]   but I want us to get an image
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.240]   of not simply what's normal,
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.200]   what are we capable of putting our time into,
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.680]   I want you to think on the level
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.720]   of what did God expect of his people
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.720]   when it comes to his word?
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.800]   Right?
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.600]   That's my emphasis here as I think about this passage
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.040]   is what did God expect of his people
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.000]   in relationship to his word?
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.280]   He wanted it to be absolutely saturating their lives
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.520]   into their minds, that it would be physically right here,
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.760]   so that they would rehearse it,
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.760]   that they would meditate on it on a what?
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.840]   Day and night.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.680]   That it would be where?
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.560]   On the tips of their tongue, that it would be where?
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.240]   Hidden in your heart, that it would be where?
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.840]   Even on your hands, it would be where?
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.480]   Even on your house.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.280]   That's the degree to which he wanted his people
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.540]   to be saturated with his truth.
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:26.480]   Now, we ask this question, is it the same expectation
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.680]   for us in the New Testament?
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.480]   Absolutely.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.160]   Take a look at this passage.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.080]   I'm gonna read it to you guys, you don't have to turn there.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.240]   First Timothy chapter four, verse 13.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.760]   Apostle Paul tells to Timothy,
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.920]   "Command and teach these things.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.980]   "Let no one despise you for your youth,
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.620]   "but set the believers an example in speech,
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.120]   "in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity until I come.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.940]   "Devote yourself to the public reading of scripture,
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.020]   "to exhortation, to teaching."
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:00.440]   What did Apostle Paul commission young Timothy to do?
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:04.000]   Primarily was the propagation of the truth
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.640]   and saying, set an example of the truth,
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.840]   model the truth, teach the truth,
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.040]   correct in the truth, disciple in the truth,
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.240]   give the truth to the people of God.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.200]   What's more, second Timothy chapter four,
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.160]   verse one through five, this one you should turn to,
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.400]   it's a little bit longer.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.000]   Second Timothy chapter four, verses one through five.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.680]   He says,
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.760]   again, in the context of so many generations,
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.080]   pretty much every generation,
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.080]   there is such a huge tide in opposition to the word of God.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.480]   Right?
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.880]   And then he says this,
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:51.440]   "I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus,
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.620]   "who is to judge the living and the dead
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.360]   "and by his appearing and his kingdom.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.860]   "Preach the word, be ready in season and out of season,
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.600]   "reprove, rebuke and exhort with complete patience
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.920]   "and teaching.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.400]   "For the time is coming when people
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.680]   "will not endure sound teaching,
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.840]   "but having itching ears,
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.760]   "they will accumulate for themselves teachers
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.680]   "to suit their own passions
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.880]   "and will turn away from listening to the truth
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.720]   "and wander off into myths.
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.840]   "But as for you, always be sober-minded,
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.480]   "endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist,
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.600]   "fulfill your ministry."
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.800]   I really hope that we would all,
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.480]   every single one of us, take upon that challenge.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:39.040]   I know Apostle Paul is speaking specifically to Timothy,
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.820]   but that challenge is to all of us, why?
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.560]   Because we all live in that generation.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:47.640]   We all live in that context
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.120]   where we're surrounded by people
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.200]   who don't care to hear truth.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.400]   As a matter of fact, the truth offends them.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.280]   And we need to have a conviction
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.120]   that we need to endure in the truth
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:04.160]   and that we need to continue to abide in the truth of God.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.880]   But I'm gonna tell, I'm gonna say this,
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.640]   that as a point of conviction for me
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.260]   and a conviction for us,
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:16.480]   I think that oftentimes the sinful tendency,
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.280]   the sinful tendency is to neglect
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.480]   and reject the word of God.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.520]   Okay, I think I have a blank there for you.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.960]   That the sinful tendency of generations of Christians,
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.720]   generations of the people of God,
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:34.720]   has been to neglect and then to reject the word of God.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.860]   The whole idea was that God expected and commanded us
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:42.640]   to carefully remember, to constantly rehearse
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.560]   and review the word so that we can carefully
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:46.880]   do the word of God.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.880]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.240]   whether it is subtle or whether it is overt,
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.320]   there is constantly a neglect of the word.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.320]   I wanna remind us of a time in history.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.840]   I began this study in the book of Jeremiah.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:08.020]   The correlating passages is in the book,
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.380]   2 Kings chapter 22 and beyond,
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:14.360]   where early on King Josiah finds himself
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.920]   in a time when the word of God was absolutely neglected.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.400]   Do you guys remember the story of Josiah?
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.920]   Josiah, as a young ruler, there was all these,
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.960]   what, high places of worship.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.400]   There was all this pagan idolatry going on.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.000]   And then essentially Josiah commands one of his assistants,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.160]   like, hey, you know, we have an archive.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:39.400]   We have this dusty book that my forefathers
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.960]   once talked about.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.280]   Josiah's sitting here thinking like,
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.320]   man, my previous generations are so shameful.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.200]   They're fighting for power and they're killing each other.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:53.680]   But I remember King David and his reverence for the Lord.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.760]   Let's read his book.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.000]   So what happens?
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.200]   King Josiah calls for this book to be found and read.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.400]   And once it is read, King Josiah rips his clothes
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.600]   and he says, oh my goodness, the wrath of God is on us.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.440]   Because what?
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.580]   We have absolutely neglected his truth.
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.400]   That's what he says.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.040]   For generations, we completely neglected his truth.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:23.160]   For us, I don't know if we regularly have a habit
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:29.080]   of consulting his truth first.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.480]   Do we have a habit of first,
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.640]   whatever life circumstances we run across,
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.600]   whatever hurdles, whatever difficulties,
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.040]   whatever joys that we come across,
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.100]   do we have a habit of consulting God's word?
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:45.840]   Because if we don't, you know what's gonna happen?
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.020]   There's gonna be a subtle neglect.
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.260]   There's gonna be a subtle neglect.
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:52.780]   You know?
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:56.380]   If you didn't know, there's this hotline.
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.540]   There's 911 for emergencies and then there's 811.
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.140]   Do you know what 811 is for?
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:06.020]   Is any time you wanna check a building code, you call 811.
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.900]   You wanna remodel your house, call 811.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.700]   It's a free hotline so you can just check code.
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.140]   Did you know that?
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:14.980]   Now you know.
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:15.820]   (laughs)
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.140]   Okay?
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.420]   And I think that's interesting that the government
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.620]   has all this code and then says check it first.
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.900]   Before you do any project, what do you do?
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.920]   You check the code.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:26.760]   Why?
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.220]   Because if you don't check the code,
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.540]   inspection will come, code enforcement will come
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.840]   and be like, do it over.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.620]   Just do it over.
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.800]   And right now we're in the building project over there.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.740]   There's all this architectural stuff going on.
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.080]   Sometimes the drawings aren't right
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.580]   and there's temptation like,
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.780]   you think we can just, you know,
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:44.700]   just keep it going?
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:45.540]   No, why?
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:46.820]   Because when the inspection happens,
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:48.060]   you can't go against it.
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.460]   Code enforcement will happen.
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.740]   You have to do it over.
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:55.700]   Our attitude sometimes is not like that.
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.860]   A lot of times we're motivated by what's effective,
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.100]   what we think is possible,
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.740]   what we think is good and successful.
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.580]   And there's this inner motivation
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:06.660]   to want to simply plow ahead
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.920]   without checking with the word of God.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.540]   Not only that, but I'm gonna talk about this
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.200]   because I've mentioned this in previous sermons
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.220]   and if you talk with me long enough,
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.300]   in the realm of biblical counseling,
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.740]   or just counseling,
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.140]   and in the realm of discipleship, right?
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.220]   There is this subtle neglect of the truth of God
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:32.060]   thinking that our problems are beyond the scriptures
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.140]   and the help of God.
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.840]   There is.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.620]   There's almost this like, kind of subtle thought
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.420]   that like, oh, I know there's Bible counseling
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:42.240]   and stuff like that,
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.420]   but what are other helps I can turn to?
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.840]   What else is there, right?
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:48.920]   And as I talk to people,
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.420]   a lot of times people have this confidence,
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.160]   perhaps in secular psychology,
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.400]   they have this confidence,
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.840]   perhaps in other means,
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.240]   and then when to come to scripture,
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:01.000]   it's kind of like, yes, yes, I know we have the Bible,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.440]   and then they look another way.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.640]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.960]   if your initial confidence,
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.720]   and if your initial trust
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.000]   goes to everything outside of the scriptures,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.840]   and then only when you're desperate,
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.680]   or you never actually turn to the word of God,
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.000]   then what do you actually do?
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.440]   You stiff-arm God.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.880]   Because remember what I said at the very beginning,
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.240]   how you treat the word of God
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.420]   is indicative of how you treat God himself.
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:31.000]   We believe, according to the scriptures itself,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.200]   and according to the word of God,
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.280]   and according to the Spirit,
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.800]   that God's word is not simply necessary,
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.120]   it's not simply foundational,
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.320]   and then you grow up to something different,
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:43.040]   that the word of God is both necessary and sufficient.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.680]   It is powerful.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.320]   It is absolutely powerful.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.860]   But oftentimes, we have this sinful tendency
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.880]   to neglect and then to reject.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.800]   This happens in all these kind of different realms,
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.480]   and that's gonna be one of your discussion questions.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.880]   In what other realms, and how do we sometimes
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.960]   diminish our confidence in scripture
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.760]   and turn to other things?
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.360]   Pastor Peter mentioned last week,
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.040]   when it comes to church building,
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.880]   when it comes to church ministry,
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.440]   and how to do ministry, how to evangelize,
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.520]   gonna be honest, we have to first ask the question,
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.120]   not so much like, how do we get the most people in here?
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.160]   We have to first ask the question,
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.640]   what does God want us to do in evangelism?
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.520]   That's a basic, simple question,
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.840]   and that question alone is sufficient
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.040]   to go about how do we do it then, right?
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.800]   So whether it comes down to the idea of discipleship,
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.100]   whether it comes down to the idea of ministry,
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:46.560]   we want to turn people to the word of God
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:50.120]   and have a confidence, like a sure footing.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.840]   I know other people might be thinking this is silly.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.200]   I know other people might be thinking
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.480]   this is one of these blind faith kind of exercises.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:03.240]   No, I believe this is a trust issue between us and God,
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.760]   to have confidence in his word.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.420]   So as I think about that,
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.220]   we're moving to the next point here.
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:14.060]   We believe that the word of God is not simply foundational.
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:18.660]   It is both necessary and sufficient, okay?
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:22.540]   The word of God is both necessary and sufficient.
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:26.800]   To teach us this truth, please turn your Bibles over to,
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.180]   let's do this, okay, for the sake of time.
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.560]   I'm gonna tell you a story,
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:33.700]   and then we're gonna turn to Deuteronomy chapter eight.
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.660]   So you can start turning over to Deuteronomy chapter eight.
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.360]   And as you do that, I'm gonna tell you a story, okay?
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.780]   The book of Exodus, chapter 16.
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.980]   It's pretty hilarious to me, okay?
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:48.900]   Reason being is because,
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:53.180]   chapter 15, Moses gives an amazing praise.
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:56.060]   It's one of the beautiful songs from scripture
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:59.460]   where Moses is praising God, like, you delivered us.
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.020]   You're so mighty.
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:04.340]   You're so mighty to save, and your love endures forever,
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.940]   and you delivered us from the bondage of Egypt.
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.220]   Amen, right?
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.460]   And in chapter 16, the nation are like,
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:13.020]   what did you bring us out here?
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.500]   They're grumbling, and they're griping and complaining,
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.880]   like, how come we don't have food?
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.420]   What's really interesting about that is,
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:23.140]   chapter 16, verse one, it says,
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.460]   I'm just gonna read it for us.
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.940]   Listen to this, okay?
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.460]   It says, the whole congregation of the sons of Israel
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.660]   grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:32.380]   The sons of Israel said to them,
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:35.500]   oh, would that we have died by the Lord's hand
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.540]   in the land of Egypt.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.660]   When we sat by the pots of meat,
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:41.700]   when we ate bread to the full, did they really?
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:42.980]   No, they were slaves.
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.420]   What is he talking about?
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.420]   For you have brought us out into this wilderness
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:50.180]   to kill us and this whole assembly with hunger.
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:51.660]   Man, so crazy.
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:56.060]   It's so crazy, you know, how short-sighted,
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:59.860]   how, you know, how lacking in faith a nation is.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.500]   And then the Lord says this.
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.820]   Then the Lord said to Moses,
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:06.500]   behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you.
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:07.740]   And the people shall go out
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:09.860]   and gather a day's portion every day.
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.140]   And then check this out, it says,
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:14.000]   that I may test them whether or not
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.120]   they will walk in my instruction.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.460]   That I may test them whether they will walk
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:20.660]   in my instruction.
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:24.140]   The story goes, only the amount of bread that fell,
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.700]   there was a lot that, like rain,
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.500]   so it was like dew all over the ground.
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.020]   And then God said, instruct the people,
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:31.500]   you're only allowed to collect only enough
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.060]   for that one day.
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.700]   And then on Saturday, or that sixth day of the week,
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:36.740]   you collect for two days,
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.260]   because on the Sabbath day you're not gonna work, okay?
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.180]   So the whole idea is they're only allowed to collect.
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.340]   What do the people do?
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:47.140]   They get big old jars and like, oh my gosh, it's free!
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:47.980]   You know?
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.400]   And they start dumping all their stuff into their jars
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.980]   and then it becomes all moldy and fungus-y
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.380]   and then it becomes all nasty.
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.460]   And then God's like, what did I tell you?
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.460]   I told you, right?
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:05.260]   To only take what was enough for that one day.
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.240]   Which is really interesting.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.660]   Why would he do that?
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:09.940]   Wouldn't it have been more efficient for God
[00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.540]   to just be like, here it is, buffet line,
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.880]   grab all that you need?
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.140]   Wouldn't it have been more efficient, on the other hand,
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:19.660]   for God to make that bread last a whole 40 years?
[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:20.500]   He could've.
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.160]   He made bread fall down.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.300]   He could've made that bread magically be preserved
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.020]   for the whole of their life.
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:28.740]   He could've made that bread, as soon as you eat it,
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.660]   just goes bloop, and it comes back into a whole loaf.
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.120]   I mean, our imagination is the limit to that.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.740]   What could God have done?
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.460]   It's just not gone through all that drama.
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:39.900]   What was he doing?
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.820]   Well, if you look at chapter eight of Deuteronomy,
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:42.820]   this is what he says.
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.320]   Deuteronomy chapter eight, verse one through six.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.800]   The whole commandment that I command you today,
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.220]   you shall be careful to do,
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.820]   that you may live and multiply and go in
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.940]   and possess the land that the Lord swore
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.700]   to give to your fathers.
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.340]   And you shall remember the whole way
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.700]   that the Lord your God has led you
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.980]   these 40 years in the wilderness,
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:04.820]   that he might humble you,
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.500]   testing you to know what was in your heart.
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.140]   So that's one.
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.780]   God was testing us.
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.380]   Are you going to obey?
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.420]   Are you going to heed my instruction?
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:15.260]   And then look at this.
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.140]   Whether you keep his commandment or not,
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:19.240]   and he humbled you to let you hunger
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.780]   and fed you with manna,
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:23.620]   which you did not know, nor did your fathers know,
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:26.900]   that he might make you know that man does not live
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.660]   by bread alone, but man lives by every word
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.740]   that comes from the mouth of the Lord.
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.740]   Your clothing you did not wear out on you.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.900]   Your foot did not swell these 40 years.
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:39.960]   Know that in your heart, that as a man disciplines his son,
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.940]   the Lord God disciplines you.
[00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:45.140]   So you shall keep the commandments of the Lord your God
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:48.240]   by walking in his ways and by fearing him.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.100]   For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land,
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.740]   a land of brooks and water, of fountains and springs
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.980]   flowing out in the valleys and the hills,
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.820]   a land of wheat and barley, of vines,
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.620]   fig trees and pomegranates,
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.260]   a land of olive trees and honey,
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.780]   a land in which you will eat bread without scarcity,
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.660]   in which you will lack nothing,
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.540]   a land whose stones are iron,
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:10.340]   and out of whose hills you can dig copper.
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.940]   And you shall eat and full,
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.500]   and you shall bless the Lord your God
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.600]   for the good land he has given you.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.420]   The reason why I read all of that
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.580]   is because one thing is very clear.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:25.580]   Earlier we read, you have to obey and listen
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:29.300]   to the word of God because that's what God demands
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.020]   and because that is what's going to be to your blessing,
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.980]   otherwise you're going to be cursed.
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:38.740]   But what's more, the word of God is actually
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.900]   what is sufficient and good for us.
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:43.400]   Do you see that?
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.740]   The word of God is actually what we need
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:49.100]   for our sustenance, provision, and well-being.
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.900]   It goes beyond simple demand,
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.780]   it goes to God's love for us,
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.780]   giving us his truth that we may eat of his truth
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:01.000]   and that that truth will continue to fill our lives.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.820]   So us obeying and listening to the word of God
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.080]   is far beyond what we can imagine.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:12.540]   And God and Jesus repeats that phrase,
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.300]   that man shall not live on bread alone,
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.220]   but upon every word that proceeds
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.780]   from the mouth of God.
[00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:23.800]   So when we think about this,
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.780]   we've been talking a lot about how we do discipleship
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.020]   at church, right?
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:33.420]   We do not want you to become dependent
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:37.600]   simply on like Pastor Peter's pulpit.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:43.380]   For if that was the case, what would happen?
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.300]   What would happen?
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.500]   You can't show up, if he can't show up,
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.740]   you would be so dependent on something
[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:50.240]   that is not sure ground.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.160]   So our discipleship is modeled primarily
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.160]   on your own hunger for the truth.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.820]   Discipleship is most effective
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:01.260]   when you are desiring of truth,
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:04.780]   when you want it so bad that you can learn truth
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:07.460]   from your own devotions, from the pulpit,
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:10.260]   from the observations and insights
[00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:12.420]   of your peers and small group.
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:15.740]   When your heart is eager for the truth of God,
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.480]   discipleship is going to happen.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:20.780]   And that's really how we want to do discipleship
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.980]   is that you will be attached to the truth of the Lord
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.980]   and that you abiding in the truth of God
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.840]   is what's going to grow you, sustain you,
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.940]   and keep you going, right?
[00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:34.300]   And so as we think about that,
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:38.220]   this next couple points I want to just go through this again,
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:41.620]   poof, poof, poof, poof, rapid machine fire kind of points,
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:45.380]   that the word of God is absolutely necessary and sufficient.
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.340]   Okay, that the word of God is absolutely necessary
[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:52.680]   and sufficient for life in godliness.
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:58.380]   Okay, first, for salvation,
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:03.380]   the word of God is absolutely necessary, okay?
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:06.060]   And I'm gonna, I know I have like,
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.540]   one, two, three, four, five, like eight points,
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.540]   but I just want to pause for a moment here, okay?
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:14.600]   The word of God is absolutely necessary for salvation.
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.040]   And in this day and age, there are so many people
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:21.980]   who do not have an assurance of salvation.
[00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:24.040]   Where can we turn them?
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.760]   The truth of God.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.840]   Why does, you know, if you turn to,
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.680]   don't turn to the Bible,
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:32.680]   if you look into the book of 1 John,
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.040]   Apostle John is gonna say,
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.380]   I write these things to you so that you may know
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:40.200]   that you are a child of God.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.520]   And when I preach the gospel so that someone will be saved,
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.320]   I can't just tell them, hey, come follow me to church.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:48.320]   Why, 'cause that's not gonna save them.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.640]   What do they need to have?
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:53.480]   The truth, the life-giving truth of the gospel.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.600]   And that's what scripture says.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.680]   In James chapter one, it says,
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:59.840]   therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.120]   and receive with meekness the implanted word
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:07.000]   which is able to save your soul.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.020]   That's what James says.
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:12.000]   What's more, if you're thinking about
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.240]   how do I grow in faith, so the word is faith,
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.880]   then we need to turn to the word of God.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.280]   In Romans chapter 10, it talks about this whole idea,
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.760]   it's like, how will they know unless they hear,
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.760]   unless they have a teacher?
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.000]   And it talks, and it simply defines,
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.600]   faith comes by the hearing of the word of God.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:36.360]   For sanctification, for your daily growth,
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.760]   understand that Jesus Christ himself said this,
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:43.880]   sanctify them in the truth, your word is truth.
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:47.240]   When the scriptures talks about Jesus' ministry to us,
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.840]   that beautiful passage in Ephesians
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:51.720]   where it talks about Christ's love as a husband,
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.880]   nurturing and feeding the bride,
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:55.720]   do you know what he says?
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:59.360]   He says he washes her of water with the word.
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.840]   That the word of God is the agent,
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.480]   the means by which he is washing of all that is impure.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:12.040]   Next, for service, if you are to serve,
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:15.920]   if you want to be trained, you know what scripture says?
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.240]   In 2 Timothy chapter three, verse 16 through 17,
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.880]   it says that the man of God may be equipped,
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:23.940]   the word of God is sufficient.
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:28.360]   What's more, hope, hope.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:33.960]   I believe we have a weird, paradoxical,
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.320]   and almost counterintuitive thing
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.560]   happening in our generation.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:42.720]   We have a very privileged generation.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.160]   People have all kinds of liberties, options.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.200]   They have excess cash.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.040]   You guys are like, I don't have excess cash.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.360]   We, generally speaking, in comparison
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:57.880]   to the rest of the world, have such a wealth
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:01.880]   at our expenditure that we can just use, right?
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.120]   What's crazy to me, though,
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.280]   is we have such a hopeless generation.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:09.200]   I was just talking to a student on Friday at college.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.400]   I mean, these students are between the age of 18 and 22.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.760]   They're at the very start of their,
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.440]   so to speak, professional careers.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.520]   They're at the very beginning of getting academic training,
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.720]   and a lot of them don't have hope.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:27.560]   You'd be surprised how many people want to quit.
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.360]   Where do we go for that?
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:33.080]   What are you gonna say?
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.320]   Don't worry, in five years you'll graduate.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.240]   I mean, I mean, four, you know?
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.600]   And then you'll have a better life.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:41.960]   But you know very well that once you start working,
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.240]   your life is actually harder.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.600]   And then every successive stage of your life,
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.520]   there's more responsibility placed on you,
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.480]   and then life becomes more, not just burden,
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.720]   but it just becomes harder.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.160]   And if you don't have the right resources,
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.840]   it's hard for you to cope with the kind of stress,
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.600]   responsibility, and weight
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.640]   that is heavy upon your shoulders.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.080]   Where are you going to turn for hope?
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:09.640]   If you just say, oh, don't worry, there are better days.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:13.280]   I mean, for secular people to say that,
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.760]   I'm like, man, for secular people to accuse us
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.520]   of like a blind leap of faith,
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:20.960]   that is such a shot in the dark.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.760]   Someday in the future, it might get better.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.200]   That is darkness.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.880]   Straight up, that is just darkness.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.360]   If you have hope simply in time,
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:34.120]   if you especially have hope in money,
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.160]   if you have hope in you, in your self-improvement,
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.800]   and you simply going through the notches of life,
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.800]   that is darkness.
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:45.000]   But the word of God is a light.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.160]   It is a lamp unto our feet.
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:50.200]   It holds precious treasure and jewel,
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.120]   and it never lets us down.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.600]   The word of God is our hope.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:59.400]   What's more, you guys remember the passage in Psalm?
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:02.200]   It says, "Blessed is the man who walks
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.600]   "not in the counsel of wicked,
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:04.960]   "nor stands in the way of sinners,
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.200]   "nor sits in the seat of scoffers,
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.980]   "but his delight is in the law of the Lord,
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:11.360]   "and on his law he met his taste day and night.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:16.360]   "He is like a tree planted by streams of water
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:18.720]   "that yield its fruit in its season,
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.520]   "and its leaves does not wither.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.440]   "In all that he does, he prospers."
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:28.800]   This generation is seeking for that, they want that.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.360]   I wanna be fruitful, I wanna feel,
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:35.640]   I wanna feel be capable, I wanna feel like I can be used,
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.280]   I wanna feel like I wanna have purpose,
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.640]   I wanna feel like I can provide,
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.820]   I wanna feel all this stuff of blessing.
[00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:43.280]   What does scripture say?
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:47.080]   The man who is in the word day and night
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.880]   is the one who's like a tree,
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:54.920]   standing firm, fruitful, lively, right?
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:59.400]   We want blessings, we have to abide in the word of God.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.640]   Next, wisdom, and renewing of the mind.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:08.360]   Should we desire discretion?
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.080]   Should we desire better discretion and wisdom?
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:14.560]   We need to turn to scripture.
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.480]   So all this again, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.120]   Machine Gun went to say this,
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.560]   that the word of God is absolutely necessary
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.900]   for every aspect of your life.
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:24.520]   I tried to pick things that basically encompass
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.480]   every single facet of your life,
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:29.840]   whether it comes to acts of wisdom and decision making,
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.680]   whether it comes to your emotions of feeling fruitful,
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.640]   whether it comes to your own sanctification
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.400]   and daily practical becoming holier,
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.880]   whether it comes to you having assurance of salvation
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.160]   and the beginning stages of your Christian life,
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:46.560]   all of it, all of it,
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.560]   the word of God is sufficient for you.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:53.480]   The word of God is absolutely sufficient for you.
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:57.040]   And I pray, I pray that we would have
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.700]   a deep, deep conviction.
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:02.420]   I believe the word of God is powerful,
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:07.220]   but I believe the word of God is so powerful
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:08.740]   that to every question of my life,
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:11.300]   I will go to it for my answers,
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:12.800]   that every hurdle and difficulty,
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.700]   I will go to the scripture in prayer,
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.540]   seeking the counsel of God.
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:19.820]   I believe it's powerful, yes, but to the degree
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:22.700]   that every hardship and suffering
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:25.940]   or every blessing and joy that I seek,
[00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.220]   I will turn to the word of God.
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:30.140]   By way of conclusion, please turn your Bible
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:33.540]   over to John chapter eight, verse 31 through 47.
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:39.080]   John chapter eight, verse 31 through 47.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:47.580]   It's a bit of a longer passage,
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:49.940]   but I wanna conclude with this
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:53.420]   because it's such a huge theme
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:55.500]   and I hope that for the rest of our lives,
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.820]   we will continue just to focus on this idea.
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:01.340]   He says this, "So Jesus said to the Jews
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:03.240]   "who had believed him,
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:07.660]   "if you abide in my word,
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:10.440]   "you are truly my disciples
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.220]   "and you will know the truth
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.340]   "and the truth will set you free."
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:16.100]   Wow.
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:21.100]   That verse alone deserves some meditation.
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.620]   And then I'm gonna read the rest of the story.
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:25.060]   He says, "They answered him,
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:26.420]   "we are offsprings of Abraham
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:29.060]   "and I've never been enslaved to anyone.
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:31.980]   "How is it that you say you will become free?
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.320]   "And Jesus answered them,
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.780]   "truly, truly I say to you,
[00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:39.100]   "everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin.
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:40.900]   "The slave does not remain in the house forever,
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:42.180]   "the son remains.
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:45.260]   "So if the son sets you free, you will be free indeed.
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:47.060]   "I know that you are offsprings of Abraham,
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:48.220]   "yet you seek to kill me
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:52.900]   "because my word finds no place in you.
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:54.860]   "I speak of what I have seen from my father
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:59.380]   "and you do what you have heard from your father.
[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:00.720]   "And they answered him,
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:03.540]   "what, Abraham is our father.
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:04.660]   "Jesus said to them,
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:06.220]   "if you were Abraham's children,
[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:08.720]   "you would be doing the works Abraham did.
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.060]   "But now you seek to kill me,
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:13.660]   "a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God.
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.160]   "This is not what Abraham did.
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.560]   "You are doing the works your father did.
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:20.760]   "And they said to him,
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.140]   "we were not born of sexual immorality.
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:25.700]   "We have one father, even God.
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:27.220]   "And Jesus said to them,
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:29.020]   "if God were your father, you would love me,
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:31.220]   "for I came from God and I am here.
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.200]   "I came not of my own accord, but he sent me.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.400]   "Why do you not understand what I say?
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:42.220]   "It is because you cannot bear to hear my word.
[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:43.680]   "You are of your father, the devil,
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:47.380]   "and you will do, your will is to do your father's desire.
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:49.460]   "He was a murderer from the beginning
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:51.720]   "and does not stand in the truth
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.760]   "because there is no truth in him.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:56.080]   "When he lies, he speaks out of his own character,
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:58.680]   "for he is a liar and the father of lies.
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:02.120]   "But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:04.200]   "Which one of you convicts me of sin?
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:08.840]   "If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?"
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.120]   And then he says this,
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:13.860]   "Whoever is of God hears the words of God.
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:16.180]   "The reason why you do not hear them
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.740]   "is that you are not of God."
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:25.460]   That passage is incredibly sobering, right?
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:27.320]   Incredibly sobering.
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.060]   Because essentially, for your blank there,
[00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:34.060]   it says the word defines who you are as a Christian.
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:40.680]   A definitive characteristic of somebody
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:45.560]   who is truly regenerate and truly a disciple of Christ,
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.680]   truly a child of God,
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:53.440]   is going to be the word of God implanted into their lives.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:57.120]   Is going to be existence of the truth
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:00.560]   and their reception of that truth into their lives.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.520]   And so should we be in a habit of subtle
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:07.280]   or of overt neglect of the truth,
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:10.360]   and then when we are confronted with the truth,
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.240]   we have a pattern of rejecting it,
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.240]   where we stand above it and we say,
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:15.360]   "Ah, I don't care."
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.880]   Even if the scripture says, "Thus says the Lord."
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:19.720]   Whatever.
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:24.580]   This passage is absolutely clear.
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:26.680]   If the word of God has no part in you,
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:28.840]   then God has no part in you.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:33.440]   I pray that we would be a people,
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:37.060]   so defined that we would be a people of his truth.
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:38.280]   Why?
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:41.640]   Because only then can we have an accurate view of God,
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.880]   and only when we have an accurate view of God
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.640]   will we arise to what God has called us to,
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:50.280]   which is true worship in spirit and in truth.
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:51.280]   Amen?
[00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:52.680]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:53:04.880]   Lord God, we want to thank you so much.
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:07.800]   Lord, I thank you so much
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:12.200]   because we know what a privilege we have.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.560]   We realize, God, we've been endowed with so much.
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:19.960]   We remember in history, Lord, that there were generations,
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:24.480]   hundreds of years where there was a famine of your word.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.800]   And even if people wanted to listen,
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:29.920]   even if people wanted to read, they'd have to go searching.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:32.760]   Father God, thank you so much
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:35.480]   that rather than leaving us in the dark,
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:38.600]   you give us the precious light of your word.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:39.480]   We thank you so much
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:42.600]   that rather than leaving us to our own devices,
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.640]   leaving us to our own naivety,
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:47.120]   leaving us to our own sins,
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:49.480]   you give us your truth to draw us,
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:52.240]   to sanctify us and redeem us.
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:54.200]   God, I pray that every single one of us
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:58.320]   would have such a deep devotion and commitment
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:01.520]   to carefully observe, to remember, and retain
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:02.720]   what is in your word,
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:06.520]   that, God, we might be careful to do it.
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:08.560]   We thank you so much for the spirit of God
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:11.880]   who allows us and continues to empower us
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:13.480]   to remember your truth.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:15.360]   We thank you for the presence of your son
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.120]   that continues to guide us.
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:20.320]   I pray that in obedience we would follow.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:22.720]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:24.980]   (foghorn blowing)
