[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240]   Okay, so I want to first do a quick quick rundown review and then jump into reading
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.920]   our passage for us.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.880]   So let's stick this guy right here.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.440]   Okay.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.040]   So real quick review.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.040]   Okay.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:31.120]   So we recall that in chapter 1 verses 3 through 14 was a long long magnificent sentence, big
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:38.280]   paragraph, which showed to us that every spiritual blessing of God is in Christ Jesus, right?
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.160]   All the heavenly blessings are to us in Christ.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.680]   And those heavenly blessings included everything from being chosen, predestined, adopted, revealed
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.880]   to us the mystery, the inheritance, sealed, all that stuff, right?
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.360]   Amazing things that we can spend, you know, hours and hours just discussing.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.480]   So oh, it's not coming out on the thing right now.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.280]   You guys can see that though.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.120]   Okay, I'm going to try to just describe it.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:14.720]   So again, just by way of review, it is all of those blessings are in Christ by God's
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.360]   loving purpose and to his glory.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.840]   It was just amazing just, you know, flow, flow of praise given to God in verses 3 through
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.840]   14.
[00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.120]   And so that was just for review.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.400]   And then in the next portion as well from from verse 15 to 23, Apostle Paul said, "Upon
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.160]   hearing then that you have faith," right?
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.760]   If I just showed you like this incredible mass of blessings are in Jesus and because
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.280]   I heard that you have faith in Jesus, I am so thankful, right?
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.280]   Absolutely thankful.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.360]   And what's more, I'm praying for you that you would know what are the hope, the riches
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.520]   and the greatness of his power.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.840]   Can you recall that?
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.080]   Now I put a little sign there.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.320]   What's happening is he said, "The power that I want you to know and understand," if you
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.440]   recall in the previous passage, he said that this is the power in which God has exercised
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.920]   towards you.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.020]   But then he starts to describe how he exercised this power, having raised Jesus, seated him
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.360]   above everything else and has lifted him up on high above all authorities, rulers and
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.820]   powers and that he's made him head over the church.
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.600]   So what did Apostle Paul do?
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.560]   He expanded on the power of God.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.880]   And then what we have here then is our passage that is connecting to that expansion of the
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.800]   power of God exercised towards you.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.800]   Okay?
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.760]   So there is a logical flow here, aside from just saying, "You guys need to remember the
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.080]   gospel, you're sinners," right?
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.080]   There's a lot more than that.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.460]   He's saying this is the power of God and you will see the connection later on.
[00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.720]   So what we're going to do now is let's read our passage one time through, but we will
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.840]   read from verses one down through verse 10.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.840]   Okay?
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.840]   All right.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.800]   How are we doing?
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.960]   Thank you guys for trying.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.960]   We shall see.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.960]   Yay.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.960]   All right.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.960]   Thank you guys.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.960]   Appreciate it.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.960]   All right.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:33.020]   Let's read the passage and it says this, "And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.040]   in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.880]   print of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.700]   Among them, we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging in the desires
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.440]   of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:02.320]   But God, being rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us, even when
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.000]   we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ, by grace you have
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.520]   been saved.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.720]   And he raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.720]   Jesus."
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.960]   That's such an important passage.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.840]   We'll camp out there next week.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.360]   Verse seven says, "So that in the ages to come, he might show the surpassing riches
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.000]   of his grace and kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.520]   For by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.720]   It is the gift of God, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.100]   For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.480]   so that we would walk in them."
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.480]   Okay?
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.920]   So today what we're doing then is technically we are taking a middle chunk of a flowing
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.160]   thought, right?
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:01.240]   What Apostle Paul wants us to see is the incredible, the gracious, and loving and purposeful
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:09.960]   power of God displayed primarily in what Christ or what he has done in Christ and that by
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.160]   us being in Christ, he has done towards us, right?
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.280]   And so we're jumping down into it, but as you guys have already seen just from the reading,
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.440]   today is talking much about the backdrop, the context of where God is exercising his
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.440]   power.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.720]   And so we go to the very first verse of what we're studying tonight.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.240]   Oh, whoops, I forgot to change the headings.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.560]   Please just ignore that.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.560]   And so we go to verse one and it says, "And you were dead in your trespasses and sins."
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.560]   Okay?
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.160]   "You were dead in your trespasses and sins."
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.360]   You can tell that this is that topic sentence again for the paragraph.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.080]   It is emphatic and he says, "You're dead."
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.520]   I mean, can you imagine someone even just saying that to you, right?
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:02.160]   Now we asked the question of good observation and said, "Okay, as this is a heading sentence
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.080]   that we need to pay attention to, we have to ask the question, what does it mean to
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.920]   be dead in your trespasses and sins?"
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.920]   Right?
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.560]   Someone could ask, "Is this kind of like a figure of speech?
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.720]   You know when the son ran away from home and said, 'Give me your inheritance,' and then
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.620]   he ran off?
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.280]   And then the father thinks like, 'Oh, how sad.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.200]   My son is dead to me.'"
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.760]   Is this the kind of deadness we're talking about?
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.680]   Where there's like a relational separation or I'm no longer even going to consider you
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.120]   in existence anymore because we have nothing to relate to each other.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.120]   Could be.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:42.440]   Now, if you do the word study, you will probably find that the word just means, it's pronounced
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.600]   necros and it means a corpse, right?
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.600]   It's dead.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.400]   Dead body, right?
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.200]   And so there you have a visual graphic there for you.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.200]   Okay?
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:58.840]   Now, when you think about that though, you should be thinking lifeless, right?
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.440]   You should be thinking lifeless.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.400]   Now in order to really appreciate the whole sentence, there are these other two terms
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.800]   that I asked you also to think about.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.020]   He says, "Not only just are you dead, but that you're dead in your trespasses and sins.
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.860]   So we have to ask, what is the difference between trespasses and sins?"
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:23.320]   Now I'm not going to take a long time to describe this, but I think what he is saying is by
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:31.700]   using this idea of trespasses and sins, there is a bucket saying the all encompassing, both
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.420]   like missing the mark is sin, harmartia.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.820]   Trespasses is more like when you cross the boundary, when you deviate from the path that
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.820]   was set for you.
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.820]   Okay?
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:42.820]   Let me repeat that.
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:43.820]   Okay?
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:49.580]   Sin is typically a broader term that says simply means missing the mark, failure, right?
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.060]   Unable to accomplish what was set for you because you missed it.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.340]   There is the other idea of trespass, it already sounds even more severe, where you're crossing
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.020]   the boundary, right?
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.840]   When you're stepping out of line, that kind of thing.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.220]   So a lot of commentators will say, typically when you use two synonymous terms, what you're
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.860]   doing is saying, "Hey, it's inclusive of all the stuff."
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:13.260]   The stuff that is a failure and you make a mistake or whatever it may be, plus the intentional
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.820]   stuff that you're committing, all of it, right?
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.300]   Now when you think about this though, I want to quickly show you something that I think
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.720]   is going to be important for us to appreciate and understand this passage later on, which
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.460]   is this.
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.620]   Within the realm of the trespasses and sins, you are dead.
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.300]   Okay?
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.580]   You're dead in these trespasses and sins.
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.900]   A face value, it's still hard to describe what that means.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:47.660]   And so we're going to do a kind of methodical walkthrough of what it could mean.
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.940]   What do I mean by this?
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:57.620]   One, to say that you are dead could potentially mean that you are doomed because of the consequences
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.000]   and sins, consequences of sins, right?
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.460]   If I accidentally, when I was, I remember, you know, we would say this all the time between
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.460]   siblings.
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.580]   If I accidentally hit my older brother on the face or something like that, or I threw
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.140]   something and it landed on him, he looks over at me and says, "You're dead."
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.140]   Right?
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.140]   Like, what does that mean?
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.300]   It means impending doom.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.300]   Okay?
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.300]   That's what that means.
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:23.820]   Does this passage mean that we are going to be facing the consequences of our sins ultimately,
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:28.380]   which is at the hand of God because that is exactly what God said.
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:34.260]   When you sin, when you disobey, when you eat of this fruit, you will die.
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.420]   Right?
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.860]   And scripture straight up says, "What do you think, oh man?
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.100]   Do you think you will escape the judgment of God?"
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.740]   That's Romans chapter 2, 3 when he's trying to convince everybody.
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.540]   "You are a sinner, you are a sinner, you're all sinners, Jewish people.
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.260]   Although you've teached the law, do you think you will escape because you taught the law?
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.420]   No, you are also under judgment."
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.820]   That's the whole point of Romans 2 and 3.
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:58.820]   Right?
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.360]   So, theologically speaking, it is consistent with the rest of scripture.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:08.280]   To say you're dead in sin can totally mean that yes, you're looking at doom.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:13.840]   But what's more, most commentators and a lot of people believe more so that to be dead
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.480]   in this trespasses and sins means that you're lifeless spiritually.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.720]   Right?
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:27.080]   Because you are in living your life, your existence is only contained within this sin
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.120]   and therefore you're lifeless to everything else.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:35.920]   So, a lot of people talk about how you have no sense to God, no sense to his word, you
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:41.200]   have no ears for him, you have no eyes for him, you have zero of the possible senses
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.200]   that can exist.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.200]   Right?
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.440]   And that's absolutely true.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.600]   To be lifeless in that sense.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.320]   And we want to take a moment to think about this a little bit because we want to also
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.480]   appreciate just like the degrees, right?
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.480]   The depths.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.440]   I remember as I was studying this, a lot of the commentators started really thinking
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.840]   about and challenging.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:12.240]   Unfortunately, in hearing the gospel in our day, we've heard lots of like kind of slightly
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.960]   wrong depictions of the gospel.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.120]   What do I mean by that?
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:21.440]   Perhaps we've heard that like, you know, the person who is out on the sea, you have this
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:27.320]   little wooden raft, you're sinking and you're crying out for help and God comes by and he
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:32.520]   drops you the line with a little vest or whatever it may be, right?
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.440]   Perhaps we've heard stuff like that.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.920]   I really appreciate the way R.C.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:42.920]   Sproul, he describes it, he says, "No, there is no bobbing for air, there is no boat, there
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.520]   is no raft, there is no broken pieces of wood, there are no bubbles in your lungs, you're
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:53.280]   dead, you're in the water many, many feet below."
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.760]   And then you know what he says?
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.120]   It describes a scenery that if we believe that God is the one who is to throw the vest,
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.960]   can you imagine what a feeble God we believe?
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.440]   That's absolutely true.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.640]   Think about this.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:12.360]   If scripture is saying you're dead, how idiotic would it be for a God to throw a vest to somebody
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.480]   who's already dead in the water?
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.200]   If you saw a corpse floating in the water, let's say he wasn't underneath the water but
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:25.280]   he was floating, and you saw somebody say, "Here," and he threw the vest, you would be
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.280]   like, "You're an idiot," right?
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.680]   Doesn't make sense.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:36.480]   As a matter of fact, the way that this passage is describing it, you're dead in your sins.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.720]   You're not just trying to get out and floating, you're already done.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:47.400]   Another commentator says, "Many people think that prior to becoming a Christian, you're
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.400]   just critically ill.
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:55.640]   However, yes, the scripture says that Christ has come for the sick, but the scripture describes
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.120]   that we are so terminally sick we're dead.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.440]   We've already died.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.160]   We have not even the power to swallow the medicine."
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:11.000]   I thought that was powerful because we appreciate then this thought to be spiritually lifeless
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.640]   means there is utterly nothing moving.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.320]   There are no senses, right?
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.040]   But what's more, to be dead then also could mean relationally dead, meaning we are dead
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.040]   to God.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.080]   I kind of posed that to you before.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.120]   Scripture talks about this.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.720]   Scripture says in Isaiah 59, "Your iniquities have made a separation between you and your
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:39.840]   God and your sins have hid his face from you so that he does not hear you."
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.280]   That's Isaiah chapter 59 verse 2.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:49.360]   There is such a massive chasm between you and God that you can never see him.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.600]   Your words will never go high.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:57.240]   There is nothing relationally you can do to say, "Please, come bless me."
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.240]   Think about this.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:07.800]   The Jewish individual has been crying out for God to bless him for generations, right?
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.040]   That's really crazy to think about.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:18.040]   But Scripture says there is such a chasm between unholy man that there is such a complete void
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:23.040]   of the relationship and to be away then from the source of life is death.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.880]   An eternity away from God is eternal death.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:31.840]   Okay, now if you notice I put two stars by the bottom one because I think that after
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.320]   looking over this passage and mulling over it and thinking like, "What could this mean?"
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.680]   And reading the commentaries and just kind of thinking through not just commentaries
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.400]   but what does the passage say?
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:49.800]   I actually more so think that you are dead in the sense that you are like a puppet.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:57.080]   You are like a lifeless sock puppet that Satan has his hand in and is just moving you.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:03.480]   I think this passage is telling us you are so dead that sin and trespass is controlling
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.480]   you.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.440]   This passage is highlighting to you that there is such an influence on you.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.520]   You're chained.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.520]   You're not free.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:14.240]   You're actually enslaved and in that way you're dead.
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.240]   You're like the doll that people move around.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.960]   I want you to think about that for a moment as you look at this passage.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.960]   Why?
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:29.800]   Because he says you were dead in your trespasses and sins and the rest of it connects in which
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.080]   you formerly walked.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.360]   According to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:41.520]   the spirit that is now working in where in the sons of disobedience of which what we
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.520]   all are.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.480]   What does that say?
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:52.360]   Sock puppet, spirit of disobedience, all up in you moving you because you are not free.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.720]   You're bound.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:58.620]   Among them we too all formerly lived in the lust of our flesh, indulging in the desires
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:05.120]   of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature children of wrath even as the rest.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.920]   So take a look at this and think about this.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.400]   First we're moving on now to section two, the control of sin.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.760]   And I'm making the point to you that my thought of you are dead in your transgressions and
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:23.560]   sins is highlighting to you the incredible force of sin under which you live.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:27.920]   So therefore it can be categorized as dead.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.560]   As we think about this and make observations, I want to make this first point to you.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.960]   First observation, your sin pattern.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.960]   So on your notes, I should have a little blank there for you.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.120]   Your sin blank pattern.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.120]   Take a look at this.
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:48.140]   You walked, you lived, you indulged in sins, in trespasses.
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:53.280]   These things are the context in which you were operating, right?
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:17:00.360]   And so my argument still is you are completely under its control.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.640]   You are living a life that was completely patterned after sin.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.680]   You walked in it and was your lifestyle.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:10.200]   You lived in it, you loved it, and you ate it up and you indulged in it.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.600]   And this spirit, notice how it says this, this spirit is now working in the sense of
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.600]   disobedience.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.720]   It is energizing all of their actions.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:24.780]   What's more, look at the influences that are upon you.
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:30.800]   It says there are four different sin influences that is upon you or you're walking in accord
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.800]   with.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.800]   Did you notice that?
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.800]   I asked you that question.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.800]   What are the influences over you?
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:41.160]   And it says you were formerly walking or you walked according to the course of this world,
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:45.240]   according to the prince of the power of the air, according of the spirit that is now working
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.520]   in the sense of disobedience.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.320]   And then it talks about your flesh.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.180]   So look at this, think about this.
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:18:02.000]   To describe your deadness, you have such a force that is moving you like a puppet.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.880]   You have the force of the world around you.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.680]   Brothers and sisters, in later on in Ephesians, Apostle Paul will describe to you a spiritual
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:16.720]   reality where this world is so dark, it is covered in layers of darkness.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:21.040]   In chapter six, it'll describe this world and you could even draw it as like a world
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.960]   of darkness, an air of darkness, the heavenly realms of darkness.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.980]   This world is covered.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:33.760]   And so to think that you're going to engage in this world without getting hit and confronting
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.600]   that darkness is being naive.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.360]   The culture around us is not neutral.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:47.560]   The kind of generational fads, the trends, the thoughts, the kind of philosophies and
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:53.200]   ideologies that is around us, it's seeped in sin.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.800]   Absolutely seeped in sin.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.280]   What's more?
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.440]   Somebody texted me and asked, "Who is this prince of the power of the air?"
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.840]   I'm not going to say that I know exactly.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.840]   Satan.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:09.960]   Now I want you to take a moment to think though, okay?
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.500]   Have the appropriate sense of eeriness.
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:21.960]   There is a powerful intellectual being who is scheming to cause you to sin.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:27.440]   Even though you're a Christian sitting here, this intellectual person, like person, is
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.120]   trying to scheme to cause you to sin.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:37.960]   But previous to Christ's powerful work in us, that individual was our master.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.680]   That individual was our father.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:43.520]   And we operate under his kingdom.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.240]   That's eerie stuff, isn't it?
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.680]   It'll make you take a moment and be like, "What the?"
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.120]   Because that's not stuff we can see with our eyes.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:56.040]   The spirit is now working in the sense of disobedience, causing rebellion, and then
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:01.360]   our flesh constantly wanting us to lust, to fixate on stuff.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.400]   I used to make excuses like, "I just have an obsessive personality."
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.400]   No, okay?
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.760]   I know some of us have obsessive personalities, but sometimes it's just you want something
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.000]   and you want it bad.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   It's just in us.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:23.160]   All of that to summarize and say, when we're thinking about death, there is complete, complete
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.320]   enslavement.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.160]   There is such a powerlessness.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.760]   When you think about death, I ask you to think about lifelessness.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:36.480]   So if you think about that in concept, there is so much, not just simply wickedness and
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:44.000]   evil, there is such an inability, such a void of power.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.160]   There is no freedom.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.560]   Why?
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.560]   Because you're lifeless.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.640]   There are no options for you.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:56.680]   So let's take a moment to meditate because again, some passages like this, it doesn't
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.440]   have a, "And therefore you shall go home and read your Bible," right?
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.960]   There isn't a practical application here.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.600]   It wants you to open your eyes and see.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.600]   Take a moment to meditate with me.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:18.200]   For some of you, have you ever felt both the eeriness of knowing that there is darkness
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.280]   in you?
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:27.400]   Have you felt the frustration of the no power in your flesh or the too much sinful power
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.120]   in your flesh?
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.720]   Have you felt the kind of devastation when you're ashamed because there's so much sin
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.940]   in you and around you?
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.320]   Have you felt guilt?
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:42.720]   Have you felt what it, it's like the realization like, "Oh my goodness, there's this kind of
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.620]   dark spiritual bondage upon me."
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:50.640]   Have you felt the frustration that Apostle Paul will say, "Who is going to save me from
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.880]   this wretched sinful flesh?"
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.120]   Have you felt that?
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:01.680]   People have been asking recently a lot of questions about their testimony.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.760]   This is one important question for you to ask.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.600]   If you're wondering like, "Is that person saved?
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.600]   Am I saved?"
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:12.440]   And you ask this question, there has to be at least some kind of realization that your
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:18.600]   deadness means separation from God, impending judgment, or complete domination by sin, the
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.120]   filling up of sin in your life, whatever it may be.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.800]   There's a spiritual reality you have to be awakened to to realize like, "Oh my goodness,
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.320]   I'm here.
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.560]   God is so far, I can't see him."
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.360]   That has to be a part of your testimony.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:38.360]   But then on the flip side, then has there ever been a time when you realize, "But in
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.480]   Christ I'm free."
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:47.040]   Just this morning I was driving over to church, it was midday after taking care of some stuff,
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.320]   and then I just happened to flip to Dave Ramsey.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:53.320]   I'm not sure if you guys listen to that show, it's a financial advisor.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.520]   Funniest thing in the world to me.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:01.920]   This guy calls in and is like, "Dave, I was in $30,000, 30K in credit card and student
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.320]   loan debt, but guess what?
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.360]   Just paid my last payment yesterday."
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.960]   Dave Ramsey goes, "You know what you're going to do?
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:16.520]   Then you're going to scream like William Wallace, and you're going to say, 'Freedom.'"
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.400]   So on the radio this guy's like, "Okay."
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.440]   And they count down, "One, two, three," and he starts screaming like, "Freedom."
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.680]   And I'm just laughing like, "This guy, dude."
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:33.040]   Think about this, if you were in $30,000 in debt, now some of you guys are looking at
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.320]   me like, "$30,000 in debt?
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.360]   That's like nothing."
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:44.400]   You know what it feels like to have some kind of cloud over you, and then you know what
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:49.080]   it feels like, you're anticipating the day when that cloud will be gone.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:56.760]   But the gospel we believe is magnified that by millions and billions.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:02.200]   But sometimes people have none of that, no trace of that in their testimony.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.960]   Where is the frustration of bondage?
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.720]   Where is the freedom?
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.640]   When did you realize this stuff?
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.880]   Now I have to move on for the sake of time.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:16.640]   The next point, if you take a look at this, he says, among them, you notice he says, "We
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.680]   too all."
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.640]   Even as the rest.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:27.360]   Now you might be asking, before in the beginning, he started with a very confrontational statement,
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.960]   "And you, you were dead."
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.880]   There was a pointing finger I felt from the Bible, and I was just convicted, right?
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.960]   But then he says, "We all."
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:42.440]   Now it could be that he's just sympathizing, it's like, "Okay, I said you, but we all."
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.640]   Because come on, let's be real, we're all sinners, right?
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.720]   Just like we would be in reality.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.640]   But I don't think that's necessarily the point, okay?
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.320]   What I mean by that is this.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:59.280]   Every single one of us, all were for sin.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.400]   And sin was for all.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.240]   But think about it from God's perspective.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.600]   He's looking at mankind.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.600]   Not one of you.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.000]   He could, he could easily have been like that.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.720]   He's looking at mankind, and the more that people multiply, there's a mounting sin, right?
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.520]   There is a mass collectivism.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.080]   There's a pervasive sin.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.400]   This sin doesn't just go deep, it goes wide to everybody.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.560]   What am I saying?
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.600]   Mankind and all of its children are ripe for judgment.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.840]   We were all sinners, just like the rest.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.720]   It heightens this bleak state of affairs.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:44.880]   For Christ, there is intensive sin, and there is extensive sin.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.080]   It spreads.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.840]   If you guys recall, for those of you guys who were in our Leviticus study, Pastor Peter
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:55.800]   was talking about there is this weird, weird judgment upon sexual act, and how unclean
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.800]   that is.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.800]   Why?
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.280]   Because there's a multiplication, oh, sorry about that, multiplication of sin where it's
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:06.040]   extending out, and the world is being covered with sin.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:10.480]   You think about it from God's perspective, that's no good thing.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:15.840]   Now, what's really interesting about this is Apostle Paul highlights, when I framed
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:22.800]   it for you guys, I highlighted the fact that he makes mention that we were, by nature,
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.440]   children of wrath, sons of disobedience, he says.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.720]   Now as you think about that, I'm going to be honest with you, I tried to do that another
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:35.440]   like what could this possibly mean, and man, my head was spinning, right?
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:41.920]   Oh my gosh, to think that, you know, it's like, maybe we could, it's palatable, it's
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.880]   like, oh, you know, sorry, you know, it just so happened you were born in Antarctica, life
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.760]   is hard, you know, like, what can we do, born in Antarctica, you know?
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:57.360]   But when he says, no, no, by nature, your nature, your very being, I want you guys to
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.160]   think about that.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.480]   If you were a defensive person looking at God saying, like, what, what are you trying
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.600]   to say?
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.960]   How highly offensive that would be, yes?
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:14.120]   But let's take a moment to meditate upon this, and this is where I go back to this diagram,
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:24.000]   because we really have to see the depth, the extent, the pervasiveness, the intensity of
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.760]   the sinful and dreadful state that we are in before Christ, before Christ ever enters
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.760]   our lives.
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:37.160]   If the scripture is saying that you are, by nature, children of wrath, then essentially
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:41.880]   you are a spawn of that which needs to be judged.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.760]   You're a spawn of that which needs to be destroyed.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.480]   And the only thing I can think of is like fungus, as soon as I thought of spawn, I thought
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.200]   fungus, right?
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:56.900]   If by nature you are fungus, you will decay everything that you touch.
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:01.560]   You will contaminate all that is around you, and you will multiply that contamination.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:05.800]   And it fits, because it says you're dead and you're a decaying corpse.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:10.360]   And that which is decaying corpse needs to be put outside and burned.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.520]   And that fits, why?
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.480]   Because God says that which he's going to judge, he's going to cut, put outside, and
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.480]   burn.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.640]   And you think about that, and you're like, whoa.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.840]   But please meditate with me.
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.120]   Ask yourself and evaluate your own theology.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.440]   How bad were we?
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:38.400]   What is the appropriate way to think of ourselves without Christ?
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:43.880]   If Jesus is not in my life, what is the appropriate way to view myself?
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.160]   That's the question.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:50.280]   And you know that this theological question is foundational to the gospel, to the church,
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.400]   to your own personal life, and how you feel.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.400]   It's foundational, right?
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.880]   It's absolutely foundational.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.800]   It's the beginning portions of the story.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:07.720]   But to answer that question, and I hope that we are accepting this truth, you are that
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.840]   lifeless corpse on the floor.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:17.200]   But what's worse is you are that lifeless corpse on the floor in jail, because you're
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.920]   bound and oppressed and contained in sin.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:26.080]   You cannot escape the influences of this world of Satan and of the flesh, because you're
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:28.560]   absolutely bound and enslaved.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.960]   You are a slave of unrighteousness.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:35.920]   But what's worse, every single person around you is in the same boat.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:40.600]   So all of mankind, everyone is in that state.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:45.600]   And what's worse, when it says you are children of this kind of disobedience, you are children
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.240]   by nature, children of wrath.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:52.360]   What I think is you, perhaps in a desire to grasp for some hope, you look down to your
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.360]   lineage.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.440]   You look to the past, and then you realize this bleak, bleak, hopeless truth that every
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:01.800]   single person before you was just like that.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.520]   Absolute wreck.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:08.280]   This reminds you of some kind of computer virus that has destroyed your computer, right?
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:12.680]   That's exactly what it is.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:18.000]   I hope I depicted that for you, because what you see then is just incredible sin in this
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.680]   passage that pervades the truth of reality.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:26.040]   If you guys do color coding, it's just all red right there.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:32.600]   It's like everything's red, because it's all covered by that kind of sin.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.920]   Complete rebellion against the holy God.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:41.440]   So if you summarize this and you start meditating, think about the crazy, imprecise way we talk
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.440]   about this.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.720]   Were we just a little stained by sin?
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.520]   I'm going to be honest, I hate listening to the radio sometimes.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.160]   That's why I flip around.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.880]   And they say stuff like, "You know, we're just all hurt people."
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:59.120]   Okay, I get it, we have hurts in our lives, but we're not all just hurt people.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.240]   We're not all just broken people, right?
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:09.160]   Because that means I would have to look to God and say, "God, wait.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.360]   You don't have to jump into the water to go save me and my corpse down below at the bottom
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.440]   of the seabed.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.280]   I'm just hurt.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.560]   Give me a little bit of your love and I'll be fine."
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.560]   Why?
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.600]   Why do I say that?
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.800]   Because it's just a simple question, what is your problem?
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:28.800]   What do you need?
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.800]   Right?
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:34.440]   And when we get that wrong, we absolutely get the gospel wrong.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.320]   The problem is not just a little hurt.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.280]   The problem is prior to Christ, we're lifeless.
[00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.440]   I want you guys to appreciate that.
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:47.360]   I want you guys to think about that because the mounting, this incredible rebellion against
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:54.400]   this holy God, God is going to say that that stench of the fungus rises to him.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:59.080]   And when it hits his metaphorical nose, it angers him.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:03.800]   And it causes him to desire to judge.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.960]   But in order to even appreciate this and meditate upon this a little more because, honestly
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:12.160]   speaking, the application of passage like this is we have to meditate.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:16.960]   You got to start thinking honestly, what do I think about myself?
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.520]   Where am I arrogant and self-defensive?
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:22.200]   How imprecisely do I picture the gospel?
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.200]   What do I believe?
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.200]   Right?
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.200]   You got to think personally.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.440]   But I started thinking like at the end of this, because there was just so much red on
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.880]   the paper, I just had this feeling.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.960]   I want to describe to you this feeling.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:36.960]   Okay?
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:41.680]   I know some of you guys have hurt people in your life and you're very sorry about it.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.680]   Okay?
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.720]   There are people who you love and you hurt and you're very sorry about it.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.960]   So what do you typically do?
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.800]   You run over and you say, "I'm so sorry."
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.800]   Right?
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.160]   "I didn't mean to do it."
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.160]   Okay.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.160]   Some things in your life that's permissible.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.160]   You can say, "I'm sorry."
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.500]   And then you can be like, "I didn't mean to do it," because that could be true.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.840]   But other things in your life, you can't say that.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.840]   Why?
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.180]   Because you meant to do it and you meant to hurt somebody.
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.680]   So you need to go over there and you need to confess.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.680]   Right?
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.600]   "I did something wrong to you.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.440]   Please forgive me."
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:19.160]   Sometimes you do certain things for such a period of time, that kind of, "Oh, my bad,"
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.640]   is not enough.
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.840]   Right?
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.960]   Sometimes you do certain things to hurt somebody and you can't take it back.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:26.960]   You know what I mean by that.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:31.120]   Certain relationships, they break, they fight, certain things are said, certain things are
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.160]   done and you can't rewind the clock.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.640]   You can't even say, "I'll make it up for it."
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.840]   You just can't do that anymore.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:37.840]   Why?
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:43.040]   Because your sin or your offense or your hurt was too much.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:48.080]   And then I started thinking, "Well, I don't think I've done this yet, but what if I did
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.000]   something that was even worse?
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   God forbid.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.040]   I pray that never, ever happens, but what if, let's say, I'm like, "Oh, my gosh, I'm
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:59.760]   in such a hurry and I drive out this parking lot too fast.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.040]   And what if?
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:07.080]   What if I run over a child?"
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.680]   Me running to the parents and saying, "I'm so sorry."
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:12.240]   I would never do that.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.240]   Why?
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.240]   How could I?
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:17.520]   That doesn't fit.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.760]   Should I run over to them and say, "Please forgive me.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.760]   I didn't mean to."
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.360]   Would I say that?
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.580]   You know what I would do?
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:31.520]   When certain sins are so insurmountable, I would just sit there, dejected and wait.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:34.800]   And I would just say, "I can't even approach you.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.920]   If you invite me to come over and say something, I will.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.600]   But how would I even go to you?"
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.040]   And then I think the gospel.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:48.300]   Thank God he initiated.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:53.920]   Because this mountain of sin in verses one through three is so huge.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:35:01.580]   How can anybody come before God and say, "Do you think you could forgive us for thousands
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:08.880]   of years of offending you, for the kind of blasphemous things that come out of our mouths,
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:16.400]   for the idolatry, for the complete rejection of your son, for the defaming of your name,
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.360]   for the ridicule of your kingdom and glory?
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:22.240]   Do you think you could just forgive us?"
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:26.120]   As though God is supposed to just love us, right?
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.360]   Doesn't make sense at all.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.460]   Doesn't even make human sense.
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:35.160]   As a matter of fact, that's when we move to the next point, right?
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:41.840]   When we understand our wretched state of sin before God, the next verses almost doesn't
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.640]   even need explanation.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.360]   So let's read it.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:55.560]   But God, being rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us, even when
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:00.920]   we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.940]   By grace you have been saved.
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:08.520]   So our salvation is not something we could have even asked for.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:12.560]   Our salvation is not something we could have even said, "Hey, God, I have an idea."
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.000]   Right?
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.080]   But meditate on this with me, okay?
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.960]   Think about mercy.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:25.240]   Mercy means that the judgment you rightly deserved was withheld.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:31.000]   But if you have no depth of understanding of your sin, that mercy is not rich.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   It's expected.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.520]   Right?
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.600]   Think about these words.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:42.960]   The great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in transgressions.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:49.720]   If you don't understand how dead we were in our transgressions, how is that love great?
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.400]   It's not.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.160]   It's common.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:56.360]   It's commonly practiced.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:02.120]   And so we say, today we're focusing in on verses one through three, and it's impact
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.080]   and ramification.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.060]   It impacts everything.
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.320]   Please meditate with me.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.160]   This point, it impacts our testimony.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.960]   It impacts our prayers.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.920]   It impacts how you feel day to day.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.760]   It impacts how you complain.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.220]   It impacts what you think is worth it, not worth it.
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:23.440]   What you think is really bad, really horrible, really good, okay?
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.120]   It affects every way you judge.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:34.560]   And so as a challenge to us, again, the application would be, please meditate upon these truths.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:40.060]   Do you have a working understanding of what it means to be dead in sin?
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:45.880]   So I want to conclude with this last kind of thought that I had.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:52.220]   I was talking to some people this week, and I realized, my goodness, we have a wide range
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:55.260]   of experience in life.
[00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:59.040]   And especially because we're prepping for our baptism, I read through lots of testimonies,
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.720]   and some testimonies are very colorful.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:07.360]   And some testimonies, people are like, you know, I just had a plain old testimony.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:13.720]   I grew up in the church, never did crazy stuff.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:19.320]   But when I was young and I heard the gospel that if I don't know Christ, I will go to
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.320]   hell.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.320]   And I believed it.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.400]   I was like, I'm not arguing with you.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.160]   I think God's going to send me to hell, right?
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.160]   So I believed on Christ.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.160]   And it was very simple, okay?
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.320]   Now, why do I bring this up?
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:37.040]   It's because some people think that testimonies are dry or testimonies are colorful and testimonies
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:41.600]   are really dynamic because of certain things here or that, okay?
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:47.280]   But please remember, you do not have to be a gangster or like the guy who just did drugs
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:52.040]   every day to be like, I really know the grace of God.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:53.440]   Why?
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:58.880]   Because even the guy who was a gangster and did drugs every day does not understand, if
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:03.080]   he hasn't seen this, this depth of sin, right?
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:06.280]   What am I saying?
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.520]   I mentioned this last time.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.740]   There is an equalizer.
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:16.360]   For whatever experience you have in your life, to have an equalizer, because no individual
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.200]   is going to stand and say, you know what?
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.360]   At least I didn't do that.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.360]   And also no individuals will be like, you know what?
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.040]   I really get sinned because look at all I've done.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:30.640]   No, your sin ran so far deeper than just what you've done.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.640]   Why?
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:36.680]   Because this pastor says you are by nature, children of wrath.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:41.400]   You come from a long lineage of people who have sinned against God.
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.680]   And so on that way, I hope you realize that it's not just your experience that's going
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:50.080]   to cause you to really come to grips with our sin, but it's upon hearing these words
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.760]   and meditating, what does this mean for me?
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.560]   Let's take a moment to pray.
