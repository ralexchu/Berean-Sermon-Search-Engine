[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880]   All right, let's pray before we jump in.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.400]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you for your blessing.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.120]   We pray, Father, that your Word would truly be living and active and it would judge the
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.440]   thoughts and intentions of our heart.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:25.920]   I pray that you would search beyond the superficial and cause us, Lord God, to think deeply, to
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.560]   meditate, to feel all that you have intended, Father, in your Word.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.360]   So we entrust this time to you, asking that you would guide and lead us.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.640]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.680]   All right, so after, just kind of give you a heads up, after this week, next week, obviously
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.360]   we're going to be in chapter 11, and then the week after that is going to be our last
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.480]   session for this session, and then we're going to take the month of August off.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.400]   And then, I think it's, we have four weeks off, and then the last Wednesday of August
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.240]   we're going to pick back up in chapter 12, okay?
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:08.320]   But next week we do chapter 11, and chapter 11 is right in the middle of the book, and
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.120]   the last session, instead of going to chapter 12, we want to take that time to review the
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.120]   11 chapters.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.840]   And I know some of you guys, especially the ones who have been coming every other time,
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.020]   it's really hard to keep up, especially in the book of Revelation.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.200]   So we're going to take at least, you know, one day to help you catch up if you missed
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.760]   a day or you feel like you're kind of lost.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.940]   Do your best to try to come to that, if possible, because hopefully that will help you to kind
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.480]   of connect the dots together, so that when we head to the second part, it'll make more
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.200]   sense to you, okay?
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.640]   So and then those of you who've been following along, and if that's not an issue, I'm sure
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.600]   it'll be helpful for you as well, okay?
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.680]   You know, studying the book of Revelation, I mean, you can see, chapter 10 is one of
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.120]   those chapters that, you know, there's, you can pretty much read it and not get anything
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.120]   out of it.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.320]   It's pretty ambiguous if you don't sit there and really dig what is the meaning of this,
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.960]   and because it's kind of a setup passage for what's coming.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.600]   So everything that's happening in chapter 10 is kind of preparing us for the second
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.000]   half of the judgments that are coming.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.720]   Remember we talked about there's seven different series?
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.920]   So this is going to lead us into the bold judgments, and you guys remember the bold
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.400]   judgments are where the really intensive stuff is going to be taking place.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.520]   My hope and prayer, again, as you guys have been studying through the book of Revelations
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.840]   together, how important is the book of Revelation and about the thought and preparation for
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.320]   the end times?
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.200]   Really important, right?
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.040]   Our sanctification is directly linked to how sober we are about the second coming, how
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.880]   eagerly we're waiting, right?
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.080]   Because if we're not thinking about the second coming, naturally we're going to end up thinking
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.280]   about this life, like making this place our home, and then we think we're going to be
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.720]   here permanently until we get older, and then we kind of spend our youth chasing after things
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.040]   that don't matter.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.400]   Our sanctification is directly linked to end times.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.980]   Our hope is directly linked to the end times.
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:19.280]   Even our fellowship, our fellowship, if it is not centered around cause of hope for the
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.320]   coming of Christ and eternity, our fellowship can easily just be friendship, right?
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.800]   In the name of Christ, just happens to be in the church, but it's not real fellowship,
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   not real partnership.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.120]   Evangelism, right?
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.080]   Disciple making, all of this is directly linked to how soberly we're thinking about the end
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.080]   times.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.480]   So, if we don't see the end, if we're not living day to day with the thought of what
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.360]   we were being taught in the book of Revelation, and this is not a reality, this is just something
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.360]   that you know it's in the Bible, some of it is ambiguous and some of it is hard to understand,
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.100]   you just know it in the Bible, but it's not a reality in your life, then probably you're
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.860]   having a hard time staying sober.
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.520]   Your fellowship is being forced.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.340]   There's like a, you feel a sense of guilt of not sharing the gospel, but it's not, you're
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.760]   not being compelled to do it, because you want to do it, you just feel this guilt of
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.640]   like, "Oh, I should be doing this, I should be praying, I should be fellowshipping," but
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.580]   there's nothing internally compelling you to do it, because what compels us is all the
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.840]   stuff that we're learning in the book of Revelation.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.060]   So, some of it makes sense, some of it we have to dig a little bit harder, but every
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.200]   part of it is directly linked to our spiritual lives, right?
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.080]   How we are able to live sober or not able to live sober.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.140]   So again, I know that a lot of the stuff that we're going over, it may be going over your
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.380]   head, but I think even if it is going over your head, the impressions that are made on
[00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.620]   you about the judgment that's coming, about the hope of Christ and how things are working,
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.100]   even if you can't connect the dots, sometimes you don't have to connect the dots to have
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.360]   an impact.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.940]   You just need to have the general impression, which basically is that the end is ordained,
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.940]   right?
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.940]   And when the end comes, there's going to be severe judgment, and then after the judgment
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.140]   is going to come restoration.
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.360]   So there, God's history is written.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.360]   It's written in stone.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.300]   This is not that what we're studying now is not, "Hopefully this will happen.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.660]   If the right things are done, that we're going to lead to this."
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.340]   This is written in the scroll, and it is permanent, and this is what we are eagerly waiting for.
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.380]   So hopefully as we're studying through that, that that kind of, it would cause all of us
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.940]   to be more sober about everything that we're being taught here.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.940]   All right.
[00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:43.220]   I wanted to do a quick review of what we've been doing.
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:50.020]   Okay.
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:06:11.580]   Yeah, you might have to just do it from there.
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.380]   There you go.
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.380]   Was that me?
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.380]   Or was that you?
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.380]   Oh, yeah, that's me.
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.380]   Okay.
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.380]   All right.
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.380]   Good.
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.380]   All right.
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.180]   So first thing I want to look at is just as a quick review, remember when the seven judgments
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.500]   started, the seal judgments first was opened up.
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.780]   You remember from chapter six, the seal judgment, chapter eight through nine, the trumpets,
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.260]   and then the bowls, chapter 16.
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.220]   And in between the sixth and seventh seal, there's an interlude consisting of two visions,
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.220]   if you remember.
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.980]   There's kind of like a pause between six.
[00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:54.620]   And then before the seventh start, we have the promise of the 144,000 Jews who will be
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.900]   saved.
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:03.380]   And then following them was a multitude, myriads upon myriads, and all of them leading to worship.
[00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.520]   So it's kind of like all the judgments.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.020]   And then right before the seventh trumpet judgments, the intense judgment opens up.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:17.380]   It begins to, again, there's a brief interlude promising that so many number of people are
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.380]   going to be saved.
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:25.660]   And then we see a picture of heaven.
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.180]   And then following that, between the sixth and seventh trumpet, there is also an interlude
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.860]   with two visions.
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.100]   The angel with the little book, which is what we're going to be covering today, and then
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.620]   the two witnesses.
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.060]   And then after chapter 11, we're going to, or at the end of chapter 11, we're going to
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.940]   go into the seventh trumpet.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.940]   And then it's going to lead us into the bowl judgments.
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.140]   But the bowl judgment is a little bit different than the other two.
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.940]   The bowl judgment is going to get to the sixth, and then there is no interlude.
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.180]   It's going to jump straight into seventh.
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:03.260]   Meaning that from that moment on, the period is going to speed up, and then the intensity
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.060]   of the judgment is going to be intensified until the end.
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.220]   So that's kind of like a broad outline, not the whole book of Revelation, but the three
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:15.340]   different sets of judgments that God had ordained.
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:21.580]   So if you remember, the first set of judgments of the seals, they were natural disasters
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.580]   upon mankind.
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.960]   It wasn't directly related to men, if you remember.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.460]   So people do die, about a fourth of mankind, right?
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.900]   Fourth of the earth, fourth of everything is affected by that.
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.300]   And then the second judgment, the trumpet judgments, are judgments that are directly
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.660]   directed toward men.
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:44.180]   So again, one is natural disaster, second is disease, very specific judgments coming
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.420]   upon men.
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:54.020]   And then the third judgment are the bowls, where the first one was a fourth, the second
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.820]   group was a third, and then the fourth bowls is going to affect all of mankind.
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.980]   So you can kind of see the intensity of the judgments that's increasing until we get to
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.580]   the end, all right?
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.900]   So that's kind of like a broad outline of what's going on, just to give you a heads
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:08.900]   up.
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.540]   And then after that, after the bowl judgments, it'll talk about the millennium, and we'll
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.060]   talk about that when we get there, okay?
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:20.380]   It begins, the chapter 10 begins by three separate times, an angel is introduced to
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:25.300]   us in the Revelations, either a mighty angel or a strong angel.
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.460]   The word in the Greek is the same, but for some reason ESV decided to translate five
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.540]   two as strong angel, but it means the same.
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.380]   So we're introduced to this mighty angel, we're not sure if it's the same mighty angel,
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:42.180]   but again, it signifies that this was not an ordinary angel, this is not one of many
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.780]   angels, this was a very specific angel that was ordained for this purpose, and it is described
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.620]   as being mighty, right?
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:54.060]   The description of this angel here seems to parallel Daniel chapter 12, verse five, and
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.100]   I think I have that passage here, okay?
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.020]   Daniel from seven says, "And I heard the man clothed in linen who was above the waters
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:06.340]   of the stream, he raised his right hand and his left hand toward heaven and swore by him
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:12.980]   who lives forever that it would be for time, times, and time and a half, or half a time,
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.540]   and that when the shattering of the power of the holy people comes to an end, all these
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.220]   things would be finished.
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.700]   I heard, but I did not understand.
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.580]   Then I said, 'Oh my Lord, what shall be the outcome of these things?'
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.740]   He said, 'Go your way, Daniel, your words are shut up and sealed up until the time of
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.740]   the end.'"
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.140]   So, the scene that we're seeing here with the angel and the interaction between the
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:38.180]   mighty angel and John is very similar to the scene that we see in Daniel chapter 12.
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.080]   So remember I told you we're halfway through, right?
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:48.420]   We're halfway through the judgments, and part of the reason why, again, if you hold to the
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:54.860]   pre-trib or mid-trib or post-trib, the seven-year tribulation, you see we're right halfway through,
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:11:01.580]   and it says for time, times, and a half a time, that's one plus two, the times in plural,
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:06.460]   they translate that as two, so that's three, and then half a time is three and a half.
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:12.420]   So the theologians believe that we're at the halfway mark, right, halfway mark of the seven
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:17.660]   years of tribulation, and then the second half is where the judgment really picks up.
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:23.020]   Okay, so if you read ahead, I think you already know what I'm talking about, but if you haven't
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.460]   read ahead, can you imagine the things that we've been reading and studying up to this
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:31.980]   point that that was the easy part, the real heavy judgment is coming on the second half,
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:32.980]   right?
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:41.520]   And so this brief interlude that we're going to have, at least as given to us, the revealing
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.300]   of the scroll, this mighty angel, and the two witnesses that we're going to be looking
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:55.180]   at chapter 11, that is kind of an interlude to prepare for the judgment that's coming.
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:12:00.900]   The description of the angel that is written down for us basically signifies the magnitude
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.700]   and the size of his glory, right?
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:10.480]   In fact, because of the magnitude of how this angel is described, some people have said
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.420]   that maybe this is Christ.
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.820]   But I think there's clear evidence that this is not Christ.
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:21.140]   Again, this is an angel of the Lord, one, because other angels have been described as
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:25.660]   being mighty, and secondly, this is an angel that actually comes down from heaven, so this
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.940]   is not his second coming, right?
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:33.700]   His second coming of Christ is prophesied at a later time, so this is not like an in-between
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.420]   coming and then he's going to come really later.
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:41.260]   So this is not Christ, but again, the description of this angel as a mighty angel, that he's
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:46.140]   so big, he's described two separate times where his feet touches the sea and the land.
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:51.220]   Again, so if you remember the initial picture that I put up there, if you may, if you, okay,
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.540]   I have to go all the way back.
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:58.420]   You see the angel, how he's touching the land and the sea?
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:06.500]   And if you notice the size of the angel, again, that's how he's described for us in this passage.
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.800]   Now again, who he is, we don't know.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:14.420]   We know that last time we studied that there were, where am I?
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:18.660]   Did I do this?
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.660]   Okay.
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:27.580]   Okay, so the last time we studied that there were two particular angels that have been
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.140]   repeated presented to us.
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.740]   One's name is Michael, and who is he?
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.340]   Archangel, and then who's the other one?
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.700]   Gabriel, right?
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.220]   Gabriel is often seen as the messenger, and he shows up in the book of Daniel too.
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.620]   So maybe this is Gabriel, we don't know.
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.620]   It's just speculation.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:50.660]   But again, there's no ordinary angel, meaning that the message that he has to give to John,
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:56.460]   John the apostle, was not just an ordinary message, that this is at the end.
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.080]   This is very important.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.180]   And obviously he's holding in his hand a scroll that's already open.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.860]   So again, this is a very important angel in God's kingdom, right?
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:12.460]   He's described as having a rainbow on top of his head, and his leg or his feet with
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:17.460]   fire, and his face was shining with the sun representing his glory.
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.040]   But again, typically when we talk about rainbow, in the Bible, it's talking about, reminds
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.940]   us about the covenant relationship that God promised to the world, that he was not going
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.720]   to bring judgment through a flood.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.640]   So it reminds us of his mercy.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:38.100]   And typically fire symbolizes judgment in the scripture.
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:42.700]   So this angel, again, there's a promise of mercy, but also promise of judgment, which
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:48.760]   we're going to be getting to in a little bit.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.500]   The angel holds in his hands a little scroll.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.740]   This is not the same scroll that was opened with the seals.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.940]   This is a mini scroll that was part of the opening of the larger scroll, and he holds
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.060]   it in his hand, right?
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:09.460]   And unlike the scroll that is mentioned in chapter five, that was fastened with seven
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.940]   seals, this scroll is already open, right?
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:21.740]   Again, meaning that what the content of this scroll is already being played out in history.
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:22.740]   That's the significance.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.500]   It's not bound.
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:29.940]   It's already being played out.
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:35.820]   And again, the significance, other than the fact that this angel is a gigantic angel,
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:42.140]   is a powerful angel, the fact that he has one leg on the sea, one leg in the land, it
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.740]   signifies the universality of his message, right?
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:51.340]   The God's sovereignty over land and earth, and again, it visually shows that God is a
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.760]   sovereign, authoritative, powerful God.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:03.180]   So even in the description of this angel, it's described as God being powerful.
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:08.540]   So John sees him, and then as soon as he sees him, he hears a loud voice, like a lion, and
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:14.860]   again, God's voice is described as a roaring of a lion in Amos chapter 3, 8.
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:23.060]   So this is not God speaking, but it sounds like God, because this is a messenger of God.
[00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:28.820]   And then when he speaks, it kind of begins this chain reaction of the thunders.
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.660]   The seven thunders begin to rumble, and they speak.
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:40.000]   And thunder, again, often in Scripture signifies retribution or judgment.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.980]   So again, the angel appears, he sees the scroll, and then the angel begins to speak, and then
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:51.060]   it kind of begins the – gets the ball rolling on this judgment.
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:56.540]   So whenever the idea of the thunder, the imagery of the thunder is mentioned, it's always equated
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.140]   with God's judgment coming, at least in the book of Revelation, right?
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:03.440]   8.5, it follows with the casting of fire on the earth.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.660]   Chapter 11.19 is associated with the seven trumpets and the plague.
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:14.220]   And then chapter 16.18 is connected with the final bowl of God's judgment, right?
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:19.620]   So in other words, when the angel speaks, the judgment begins to start to come out,
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:20.620]   right?
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:21.860]   So we're not there yet.
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:27.060]   We're not told exactly what's happening yet, but this angel is sent to begin this
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:34.900]   final judgment, final phase of the judgment.
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:39.580]   But in verse 4, when he hears it, and he goes and he hears the rumbling, and we're not
[00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.140]   told exactly what it is, right?
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:46.380]   But it was intense enough where John felt the need to put it down.
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.540]   And he was about to write it down, and then the voice comes and he says, "Do not write
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.540]   it down."
[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.180]   He says, "Seal this up."
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:18:01.020]   And then it says not to write it down, which is in direct contrast to what we see in 1.19,
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:05.860]   where the Lord comes to him and specifically tells him to write down what he sees so that
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:06.860]   he may spread it.
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:11.060]   But here, whatever the content is, and now we can speculate what it is, we don't know,
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.300]   but it must be related to the judgment.
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:17.660]   It must be related to something that's coming that he does not want it to be revealed.
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:24.500]   And he says to seal it and not to write it down, which is not uncommon because we see
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:30.580]   in other parts of the scripture where God does tell his disciples not to make it known.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:35.580]   2 Corinthians 12, 3-4, Paul talks about a man who was caught up in the third heaven,
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:39.340]   and he says, "I know that this man was caught up in the paradise, whether in the body or
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.620]   out of the body, I do not know.
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.620]   God knows."
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:46.260]   And he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:51.020]   So again, we don't know if it's the same thing, but we know that in that passage, Paul, again,
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:57.060]   tells us that there are things that God allowed him to see, but he didn't want to communicate.
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:02.620]   We see that again in Daniel 12-4, the parallel passage, "But you, Daniel, shut up the words
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.100]   and seal the book until the time of the end.
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.620]   Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase."
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:12.700]   What do you think the reason?
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.780]   We don't know what the content is, but what is the reason behind why God wouldn't reveal
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:20.540]   something?
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.900]   Think about it for a second.
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.780]   There are things that God would not reveal to us.
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:32.980]   What are some things that God doesn't reveal to us on purpose?
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:39.140]   He said that the time of His coming, He said, "You will not know."
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:45.740]   But there's a lot of other things that He hides from us.
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:52.420]   What else do you not know?
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:56.940]   I know we have Google, but Google doesn't have everything.
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.740]   There's a lot of things you don't know.
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.860]   There's a lot of things you don't know when you're going to die.
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.740]   You don't know, at least until you do get married, and you don't know who you're going
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.340]   to marry.
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:12.820]   You don't know what your life is going to be like, like the hardship that may be coming.
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.900]   There's a lot of things that we don't know.
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:23.460]   And there are certain things that God deliberately shut the door, and He doesn't want us to know.
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:26.800]   So we may be curious, but we don't know exactly what it is.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:33.860]   But in God's sovereign desire and His sovereign knowledge that He said whatever it was contained
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:34.860]   in it.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:42.420]   And my guess is it had to be something about the – maybe something about the judgment
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.140]   that's coming.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.380]   Maybe He doesn't want His children to know.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:50.260]   Again, this is just my guess, right?
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:56.460]   The intensity of the persecution coming upon Christians because of what we see in the second
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:00.100]   half, that it was pretty hard.
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:04.980]   But at the second half of the judgment, He says before the final judgment ends, final
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:10.860]   bowl judgment ends, persecution is going to increase like no other, right, among Christians.
[00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:14.480]   Now some people who believe that pre-trib rapture, that we're going to be safe from
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.160]   all of this, and only people who are going to suffer during this period are Christians
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.840]   who came to Christ late during the tribulation.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:26.100]   Some people, if you believe in pre-trib rapture, that's what they believe.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:31.820]   Now I think that Christ is going to – that we're going to make it through the tribulation,
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:35.500]   meaning that church is going to go through this tribulation.
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:40.860]   And that this – the judgment that's going to come upon the earth, the final judgment,
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.700]   before it comes, He's going to purify the church.
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:49.280]   And only those who have real faith, true faith, are going to survive at the end of that, right?
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:55.060]   And so maybe my guess is, the reason why this is withheld, is that maybe there is written
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:22:00.620]   in there specific knowledge of who will and what specific and who and what churches are
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.860]   going to suffer through all of this.
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.820]   And I think just like He doesn't reveal to us the hardship that may be coming down
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:12.020]   the line, if we knew it ahead of time, there's a lot of things we wouldn't do, right?
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.860]   God gives us the strength to do it when we get there, but if we knew it ahead of time,
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.500]   in our mind, we wouldn't do it.
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:18.500]   There's a lot of things.
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.060]   There's a lot of things I wouldn't have done, right?
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.520]   If I knew ahead of time how difficult that was going to be.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.380]   So again, this is just my speculation.
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:31.820]   Considering the context, considering like what was being said, that it was the thunder
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:37.180]   that was rumbling and it was saying, and what the thunder said, He said, "Do not reveal
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.180]   yet.
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.180]   It is not time," right?
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.180]   "Do not write it down."
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:51.740]   That possibly He's talking about what's going to happen to Christians before the end, right?
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:56.000]   After He gives that instruction, the angel raises his right hand and swears that there
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.480]   will be no more delay, right?
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:08.580]   Now we saw, I think in chapter five or chapter six, where remember the martyrs who were martyred
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.660]   underneath the altar?
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.000]   They were crying out, "How long, O Lord?"
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Right?
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.320]   That they would be vindicated, and so they're crying out to God, and He says, "God is coming
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.560]   in response to the cry of those who have been martyred."
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:25.720]   So Daniel 1, we see the same thing where they're crying out, "How long will it be before these
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.840]   astonishing things are fulfilled?"
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.240]   And then we see again in Revelation, in that passage that I just quoted, "How long, sovereign
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:37.900]   Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?"
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:42.980]   So it almost seems like when He says there's going to be no more delay, that this is in
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.260]   response to the prayers of the saints, right?
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.220]   That it will come.
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.980]   That all the Christians who've been longing and waiting for Him to come, He says He's
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.660]   finally going to answer their prayers.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:24:00.160]   And again, in the context, all the Christians who are suffering, who are being persecuted
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.700]   and having hardship, and they want the suffering to end, that God is going to respond to that
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:13.160]   and say, "Now, God is going to act, and there will be no more delay."
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:19.240]   So the promise of not delaying is a blessing to those who are crying out for relief, but
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:24.120]   it is also a warning that the period of patience for the world to repent will also soon come
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.120]   to an end.
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:31.800]   Now, again, I'm not sure if this is related to the next part when He says, "Eat of it,
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:36.800]   and it will be sweet in your mouth like honey, and it will be bitter in your stomach."
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.900]   But it seems to me, it seems to fit when He says there will be no more delay.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:45.960]   It means that His promise of bringing the final judgment is going to come.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.720]   So for those who are suffering and calling out to God, obviously it would be sweet to
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:50.820]   them.
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:56.400]   But it also means the period of patience, of repentance, that that period is also going
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.400]   to end.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.520]   And remember, up to this point, even in the midst of intense judgment, God is waiting
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.520]   for people to repent and come to Him.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:10.840]   But when He says He will no longer delay, remember we talked about that in Peter's writing?
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:15.680]   He said that the reason why He's delaying is because He doesn't want people to perish.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:21.680]   That we're living in a period of grace where all that God is doing is to bring the full
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.240]   number of the elect to come into the kingdom.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.360]   So when He says He's no longer delaying, it means that that period is over.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.400]   That God is no longer, there's no reason for Him to wait.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:37.520]   That now the judgment that's coming upon mankind is strictly for the purpose of judgment.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:40.080]   This is not a period of grace anymore.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:45.720]   So it is sweet in a sense that if we've been waiting and longing for Him, that He's going
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.720]   to answer our prayers, but it's also going to be bitter because it's going to be full-on
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.960]   judgment.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.040]   God is not going to hold back, right?
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.440]   The wrath that He's been holding back, He's going to finally unleash completely.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:01.440]   So as intense as judgment was up to this point, it was all restrained judgment.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.120]   It was all judgment hoping to bring repentance.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.760]   So it is bittersweet.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.520]   And He says, the angel says that the mystery of God, that He promises that the mystery
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:17.820]   of God would finally be fulfilled.
[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.560]   This mystery will not be delayed.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:30.820]   So the revelation of the gospel, Colossians 1, 25 and 26, is referred to as the mystery.
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:36.260]   And again in Colossians 2, 2-4, Christ Himself is referred to as God's mystery.
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:42.560]   And I put some other verses there.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:48.920]   So when He says the mystery of God is going to be unleashed, meaning that God's final
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.740]   purpose of what He's been doing through history, through human history, His promise of the
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:59.260]   seed coming, the establishment of Israel, Christ, His suffering, His resurrection, the
[00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:04.980]   period of the church, evangelism, tribulation, that everything is going to be finalized,
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.140]   right?
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:10.460]   Meaning so whenever we, again, typically when we think about the gospel, we think about
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.640]   one side of the gospel, right?
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.180]   Which is His grace, His mercy, because that's where we live.
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:20.540]   You and I are living during a period where God is being gracious to the world.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.540]   And as much as people complain, like how can a loving God allow 9/11?
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.180]   How can a loving God allow this and that to happen?
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:32.580]   According to God's perspective, He says, because He's loving, He's allowing these things to
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:33.700]   happen.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.800]   Because He's loving, because we're living in a period of grace, that we have opportunities
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:42.520]   to bring people to Christ, that they would, they still have opportunity to repent and
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:43.700]   to come to Christ.
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:48.260]   So God's perspective and the biblical perspective, exactly the opposite of the questions that
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.820]   people ask in the world, right?
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:54.860]   Because He's loving, He hasn't come yet.
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:57.860]   Because He's loving, He's withholding Himself.
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:04.300]   And the little bits and pieces of the wrath that we see is all for the purpose of bringing
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.100]   people to Himself, right?
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:11.640]   But when that final day comes, when the mystery is going to be finally fulfilled, He's no
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.820]   longer going to need to withhold, right?
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:20.540]   Because that period of grace will be done and wrath is going to come before the final
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:26.340]   consummation of the church.
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:31.860]   And finally, John is told to take the open scroll and take it from the angel and he is
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.260]   told to eat it.
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:40.060]   Oftentimes in Scripture, when a prophet or servant of God is told to eat, it means to
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.980]   digest and meditate on it, study it, right?
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:49.140]   In other words, he's not telling John to just regurgitate what I said.
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:53.860]   And that's the difference between a prophet versus somebody who's just memorizing Scripture
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:54.860]   and just regurgitating.
[00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:58.340]   There's a huge difference, right?
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.340]   And you don't have to be a pastor to know what that means.
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:04.300]   You can have friends who just memorize Scripture and they just have words that they throw at
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.660]   you, but they themselves don't really believe it.
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:07.820]   They haven't digested it.
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:12.620]   There's a huge difference between somebody who's been convicted and changed by it and
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:14.500]   is conveying to you, right?
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.180]   They're a witness, right?
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.180]   That's a difference between somebody who is a witness of Christ and somebody who's just
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:24.260]   regurgitating information, that this is the gospel that I heard, I'm just giving it to
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.260]   you.
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:30.580]   So the prophet John, the apostle, basically says, "Before you go and spread it, you need
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.900]   to digest this food, right?
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.660]   To eat of it."
[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:37.980]   But he also says, "You're going to eat of it, but it's going to be bitter in your stomach."
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:44.060]   And again, we're not exactly sure what he's eating and why it's sweet in his mouth and
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.580]   bitter in his stomach.
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:50.500]   We can kind of conjecture, right?
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:54.140]   The sweetness of the word turning bitter in the stomach may be reference to the promise
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:58.220]   of the revelation of God's mystery not being delayed any longer, which I mentioned already.
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:03.500]   Again, this is just my guess that maybe that's what it's referring to.
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:08.820]   The sweetness will be the promise of vindication and deliverance for God's people, but along
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:13.940]   with it will come severe persecution and hardship for Christians before the final judgment comes.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:14.940]   So possibly, right?
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:20.460]   I'm not saying that this is what he's talking about, but the scripture does talk about the
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.340]   word of God being sweet, right?
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:26.500]   And there are other parts where the word of God can also become bitter.
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:31.900]   So can you think about a situation where the word of God or something being sweet initially
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:35.900]   but being bitter later?
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:42.300]   Temptation, right?
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:47.180]   Every temptation we face, it's tempting because it's sweet initially, but once you eat it
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.980]   and digest it, it becomes bitter, right?
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.180]   Every sin, right?
[00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.660]   Every sin we practice, it's tempting.
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.740]   If it wasn't sweet, we wouldn't be tempted, right?
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:02.900]   It's sweet initially, but once you've digested it, it becomes bitter in your stomach and
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:07.180]   it makes you sick, right?
[00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:11.100]   The whole world can be described that way, right?
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.500]   The world is tempting.
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.580]   It's sweet, right?
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:20.940]   It's pleasing to the eyes, but once you digest it, it becomes bitter.
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.660]   How about false prophets, right?
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:28.060]   The reason why they're so appealing is because their words are sweet.
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:34.860]   They twist God's word and they take basically all the frosting on the desserts, right?
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:39.780]   They don't give you the meat and they just kind of give you whatever the itching ears
[00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:44.060]   want to hear and they're just kind of plucking out what's best and giving it to people and
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.060]   everybody eating it up.
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.060]   They love it.
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:50.780]   So it's sweet in their mouth, but once it get into your stomach, right, it's unhealthy.
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.180]   It's bitter.
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.740]   And that's typically what the false prophets were known for.
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:58.980]   They were constantly telling people what they want to hear instead of what they needed to
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.420]   hear, right?
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:06.260]   But sometimes even the truth can be sweet and bitter, right?
[00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:09.220]   Sometimes even the sweetest truth, right?
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:16.820]   In what way can the word of God be sweet and bitter other than what I just said?
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:23.020]   I could think of it's sweet because of salvation to me, but it's also bitter because it means
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:31.460]   the people that I love weren't saved, that they're going to be under condemnation, right?
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.500]   I'm sure you guys can think of some.
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:37.940]   So I'll give you some time in your small group to talk about that, right?
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:42.700]   But all of this that we're talking about in chapter 11 is to prepare us for what's coming
[00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:43.700]   in the bowl judgment.
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:49.820]   So what I want to do is what I'm going to ask you to do, hopefully you'll do it, okay?
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:53.500]   Next week we're going to be studying chapter 11, but we're going to have a whole month
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:57.140]   off and really take time.
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:02.060]   If you kind of got lost in the first 11th chapter study, I really want to encourage
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.420]   you to go back and just read it.
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:07.780]   You don't have to go back and try to figure out what the red horse and the pale horse
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:08.780]   and what does it mean by that.
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.620]   You don't have to go read commentaries, but just be familiar with it.
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:20.980]   In fact, I think we miss the whole point sometimes if we try so hard to figure out when and how
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:26.500]   and it is a pre-trip, post-trip that you really miss the whole point because, you know, I
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:30.460]   think the early church when they heard it, I'll bet you a lot of this stuff was mysterious
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:32.580]   to them too, right?
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:37.820]   But I think there's a reason why it was given to us in this way, because it was meant to
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:38.820]   leave an impression.
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:42.020]   Remember we talked about that, how God communicates?
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:46.620]   Like I can communicate with my words and I can paint a picture for you, right?
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.780]   And you can look at that and then you can say, "Oh, that's what it means."
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:55.780]   You can watch a movie, hear music, and all of this has different effects on you, right?
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:59.900]   And some people maybe lean more toward just, "Okay, I'd rather have somebody just explain
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:00.900]   it to me."
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:05.900]   And then I know a lot of you learn a lot better visually if you just look at it and maybe
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:11.100]   the painting or something, you can see the sadness or the joy of the painting right when
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:12.460]   you see it, right?
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.580]   And music, music is powerful.
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:20.020]   If you hear certain songs with certain kind of melody, it could bring back memories, it
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.240]   could bring healing, right?
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:24.340]   It could bring friends together.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:28.460]   So all of these things are forms of communication that makes an impression on us, whether it's
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.140]   through hearing, seeing, touching, tasting, whatever it may be.
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:36.820]   Book of Revelation was written to make an impression.
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:43.940]   And the impression is, right, the judgment that's coming is intense.
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.140]   But we're not at the end.
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:46.660]   The end conclusion is not the judgment.
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:51.220]   The end conclusion is the judgment is going to come where he's no longer going to withhold
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.020]   his judgment, right?
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:57.940]   Because all this time he's been gracious with the world and then after that is going to
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.240]   come paradise, right?
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.940]   And so it's meant to leave that impression.
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:05.700]   So even as you're reading it, if you don't understand all the details of it, I don't
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:09.980]   think it's, you know, I don't think you're missing what God intended just because you
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.380]   don't understand every bit and pieces of it.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.500]   I think the goal of it is to make that impression.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:20.100]   That impression is that it will cause a sense of urgency, that we would see the magnificence
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.900]   of Christ and what he has done.
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:26.060]   We could see his mercy, right?
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:29.580]   Even in the content, even as we're studying last week, right?
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:34.620]   Even in the midst of all of that, he says he's waiting for the sinners to repent, right?
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.180]   And all of these things would make an impression.
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:40.240]   So I want to really encourage you to go and just read, right?
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.280]   Even if you get lost, just read.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:46.840]   And then hopefully you'll prepare yourself during the month of August to really come
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:51.900]   with a, wow, this bold judgment is intense and at least know the bits and pieces and
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:57.100]   details so that we would be impacted the way that God intended it to, okay?
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:03.300]   And again, let me just review the questions, okay, before I let you go.
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.820]   Do you think you are actively engaged in the spiritual battle we are called to today?
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:07.820]   If yes, how?
[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:10.420]   If not, why not, right?
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:18.260]   And again, as I mentioned already in the beginning, we can be at Bible study every single week
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:21.820]   and just mentally check in and check out, right?
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.960]   I know that, you know that.
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:30.900]   So I hope that you'll take some time to really think through, not are you coming to church,
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:35.300]   are you faithful in doing these things, but how sober are you, you know, how aware are
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.300]   you of these spiritual things?
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:41.680]   And maybe part of the reason why all these spiritual things in Revelation sound so weird
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.600]   is because we don't think about it enough.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:48.060]   We think about angels that we don't, the demonic world, the angelic world just doesn't seem
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:51.700]   real to us because we just don't think about it, right?
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:56.000]   And maybe we should be, not maybe, we should be thinking about it, right?
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.260]   Because the Lord tells us that we are engaged in spiritual battle whether we know it or
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.260]   not, right?
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:05.260]   Number two, why do you think God keeps certain truths from us?
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.420]   And then I already kind of discussed that with you, take some time to discuss it with
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:09.420]   your group.
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:14.620]   If Jesus was to no longer delay and come tomorrow, how would that affect the way you live today?
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:18.820]   So obviously we studied where he promises that he's no longer going to delay.
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:21.600]   We're not there yet, right?
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.600]   We're not there yet.
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:27.220]   He's making that promise halfway into the tribulation and then he's saying that the
[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.780]   time is going to end, right?
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:33.460]   And let's say if we were, if we heard that and he says he's no longer going to delay,
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:37.740]   which means it could be tomorrow, it could be the next day, but that period of grace
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.740]   has passed and he's going to fulfill what he started with us in our salvation.
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.760]   He's going to bring it to completion.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:50.700]   If that's the case, how would that affect what you're doing today, right?
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.020]   And how should that affect?
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:56.280]   Or is that something that's like, oh, we can't live like he's going to come tomorrow, right?
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:59.600]   So take some time to discuss with your small group.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:06.480]   And again, next week, one more study in chapter 11 and then the week after that we're doing
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.480]   reviews.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:12.720]   So if you know people that for whatever reason they feel lost, make sure that they're there
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.560]   for that so that we can review it together.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.560]   Okay.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:24.760]   All right, let me pray for us and then I'll let you guys go.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:28.240]   Merciful and loving Father, I thank you for my brothers and sisters.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:36.440]   I thank you, Lord God, that even in the midst of a long day and being physically tired,
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:42.120]   and I know Father that we are here because we're wrestling and striving and sometimes,
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:47.240]   Lord God, we feel defeated because it's so hard to stay sober.
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:53.560]   But I pray, Father, that the Holy Spirit that you've entrusted and placed in us would help
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:58.560]   us in our weakness, that even when we can't pray or have a hard time praying, that it
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.800]   would continue to groan on our behalf.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:05.780]   We thank you for interceding for us when we are weak.
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:09.560]   We thank you for being gracious, Lord God, when we stray.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:14.400]   But we pray, Father God, that you would help us as you've given us your spirit, not to
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:20.840]   wallow in defeat, not to accept mediocrity or lukewarmness, but help us to wrestle and
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:25.640]   to struggle and to fight and run this race, Lord, as to win.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:29.900]   Help us to be aware of the spiritual battle that we are in, that all that you are teaching
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:34.880]   us through revelation, Lord God, would have the intended purpose that you've had for all
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.240]   of us.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.160]   We pray that you would bless our small group time, that through it, Lord, that we may be
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.560]   sober as iron sharpening iron.
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.800]   We thank you in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.360]   Amen.
