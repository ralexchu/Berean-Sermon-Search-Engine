[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.500]   Humans are movers.
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.260]   We move, literally.
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.400]   We can make a new home all over the world.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.000]   We travel, we sightsee,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.600]   and as soon as wooden ships could traverse oceans,
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.800]   we'd jump from continent to continent,
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.040]   then steam engine boats of iron came along
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.240]   and then came along commercial jets.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.700]   Most of the world is now open to us today.
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.540]   So what's the difference between the frenetic globe-trotting
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.680]   of an unsatisfied soul and the movement
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.280]   of a globe-trotting soul satisfied in Christ
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.300]   and moving out on mission?
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.760]   This was a point of application from Pastor John's sermon
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.260]   on the woman at the well in John chapter four.
[00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.960]   The clip comes in from Annabelle,
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.600]   originally from Seoul, South Korea.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.720]   Annabelle then moved to Los Angeles
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.560]   and finally to New York City where she lives now.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.200]   Here's the clip that she sent to us.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.420]   John Piper preaching on John four,
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.140]   the woman at the well back in 2009.
[00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.800]   - This is a sign either that she begins
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.280]   with a cavernous need that she thinks only men can meet
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.200]   or these men are not finding in her what they want
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.380]   and they're dropping her time after time after time
[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.200]   so that the end she must be totally devastated
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.760]   that she's been thrown out five times.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.760]   One or the other, she's left with a huge wound,
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.720]   a huge deadness because she can't afford to feel anymore.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.280]   She's been hurt too many times.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.400]   I cannot feel anymore.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.760]   I just do it.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.160]   Some kind of bondage and slavery that drives her.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.160]   Now she is locked and he's gonna move in.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.040]   He can move in by showing her, you are thirsty.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.480]   You are so thirsty.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.720]   Wake up, wake up.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.000]   You think it's all about men.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.180]   You think it's all about romance.
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.000]   You think it's all about being embraced and held.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   You think it's all about having security.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.760]   It's not about any of that.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.220]   It's about me.
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.220]   It's about water and not sexually with me.
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.140]   Me, Messiah, Savior, Prophet, water.
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.620]   Your soul, your soul is made to drink
[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.560]   deep, deep, deep satisfaction from Jesus.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.860]   And if you're not, I know what you're doing.
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.540]   You're into a serial routine.
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.420]   Probably for most of you, it's not sex.
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.140]   Some of you it is for sure.
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.500]   Jumping from bed to bed.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.340]   We're learning about Jesus here.
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.340]   Compassion, aggressive, surgical, relentless love.
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.580]   Knows everything about us.
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.020]   Isn't it good to be known?
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.980]   Painful as all get out and good to be known by somebody.
[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.980]   This kind of person anyway.
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.180]   He knows everything about you, absolutely everything.
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.300]   Kinky stuff, he knows.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.100]   Hidden stuff from your youth, he knows.
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.980]   Financial stuff, he knows.
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.300]   Thoughts, he knows.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.980]   Feelings, he knows.
[00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.460]   Midnight stuff, he knows.
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.980]   Knows you completely.
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.100]   And he's the most important person in the universe.
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.600]   Do you know yourself?
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.360]   You're meeting yourself in this woman.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.520]   The thirsts.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.880]   One of the evidences that we are not drinking Jesus,
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.320]   either because you're an unbeliever
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.160]   and you've never even tasted,
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160]   or because you're a believer and something has begun
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.360]   to lure you to another fountain,
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.680]   starting to go there,
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.840]   or you've just blocked him out
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.920]   because you've got some hidden thing
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.560]   you wanna keep doing or whatever.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.280]   One of the evidences of not drinking deeply from Jesus
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.680]   is the instability of constantly moving
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.480]   from one thing to the next, seeking to fill the void.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.760]   You may be going through sexual partners.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.040]   You may be going through friends.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.520]   You may be going through jobs.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.560]   You may be going through churches.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.920]   Just one after the other.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.720]   You may be going through hobbies,
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.040]   internet stuff, hobbies, games.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.040]   You may be going through hairstyles.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.560]   You may be going through wardrobes.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.160]   You may be going through cars.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.160]   You may be going through locations of where you live.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.720]   'Cause there's no deeply contented identity in Christ
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.680]   deeply contented, deeply satisfied.
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.720]   That's what water means.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.720]   Living water is your soul is a cavern of desire.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.760]   And I offer myself to you, Jesus says,
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.280]   as water that lives.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.640]   It becomes a well.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.880]   It just satisfies day after day.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.440]   You get up with hungers and longings
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.520]   and soul achings in the morning.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.520]   Come to me and you'll find stability of contented identity.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.280]   And then you don't move around so much.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.000]   Jump in here, jump in there, jump in here, jump in there.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.080]   Crave, crave, crave, crave, crave, crave.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.320]   Nothing's working.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.080]   Oh, don't you love people who are so deep with Jesus
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.320]   they know where it's at?
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.720]   The water.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.440]   They live by the fountain.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.000]   They never go anywhere.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.800]   They just live there.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.720]   They're not jumping from job to job
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.720]   and wife to wife and girlfriend to girlfriend
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.200]   and car to car and hairstyle to hairstyle.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.840]   They are so there.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.480]   And here's the interesting thing about that.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.160]   That sounds static, doesn't it?
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.680]   Baloney.
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.320]   It isn't static.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.000]   Believe me, it isn't static.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.920]   I don't mean that the Christian life
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.400]   with that kind of centered, deep,
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.480]   satisfied identity by the fountain,
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.440]   satisfied day after day, freshly with new water,
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.280]   coming up from this friendship and this relationship.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.160]   I do not mean this is static.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.160]   There is a difference between confident movement of faith
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.600]   and craving movement of frustration.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.720]   You got that?
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.720]   There is a difference between confident movement in faith
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.000]   and craving movement of frustration.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.720]   Gotta move because this is not working.
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.400]   Here, move, move, move.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.800]   Or this is so working, I'm taking it.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.040]   I got a plan.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.240]   I'm making something of my life.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.240]   I'm not wasting it.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.360]   I am moving to China.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.360]   I'm moving to Ukraine.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.720]   I'm moving to Southeast Asia.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.080]   I am on the way because I got my feet on a rock
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.160]   and there's a fountain coming up out of this rock
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.520]   and it goes with me everywhere.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.360]   It's Jesus, not any geographical location.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.800]   So don't hear me say that the movement in life,
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.960]   job to job and hairstyle to hairstyle
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.720]   and wife to wife and sex to sex,
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.200]   TV program to TV program,
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.600]   that the alternative is frozen.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.680]   I got the fountain.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.680]   You know that's not what I'm talking about.
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.800]   This fountain is really a moving fountain.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.720]   Like a waterfall, I've used that analogy before.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.160]   Stay under it, it moves.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.320]   Oh, Jesus is a mover.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.200]   He's gonna reach the nations.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.680]   The fountain's on its way to the nations.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.480]   You wanna get drink deepest,
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.360]   go with him to the nations or the neighborhood.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:17.360]   This text is about us, our cravings, our longings,
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.480]   our desperate questings to find something that satisfies.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:28.320]   - Amen, what a fascinating take on John four.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.160]   Thank you for this clip, Annabelle.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.280]   And the sermon is titled,
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.600]   "The Tragic Cost of Her Cavernous Thirst."
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.600]   Preached on June 21st, 2009.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.200]   You can find the whole thing at desiringgod.org.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.480]   Do you have a clip you like?
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.520]   Send it to me.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.800]   Give me the title of the sermon
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.360]   and the timestamps from the audio
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.800]   of when the clip begins and ends.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.400]   Tell me why it's impacted you.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.600]   Give me your name and the closest city to you.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.880]   And email me all of those details
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.080]   at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.720]   That's an email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.680]   And put the word clip in the subject line
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.520]   if you would please.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.280]   Well, do you annoy God?
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.320]   Do I annoy God?
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.680]   Like, we have kids that we love,
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.320]   but they often annoy us too, right?
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.920]   So do we annoy God?
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.440]   And do we annoy Him to the point
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.280]   that He regrets ever having made us from the beginning?
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.080]   Read Genesis 6:6.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.720]   Because there it seems the answer is yes.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.520]   Perhaps God has a low-grade regret that we even exist.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.640]   Or does He?
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.720]   John Piper will address that next time on Friday.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.520]   I'm Tony Reinke, we'll see you then.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.120]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.720]   (upbeat music)
