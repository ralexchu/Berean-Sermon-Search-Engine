[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.640]   Alright, so schedule-wise, we have this Bible study.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.240]   Next Wednesday is going to be an overview review of the 17 chapters that we've been
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.040]   in and then we're going on an extended break for about six to seven weeks.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:28.000]   And then, but during that break, again, we're going to encourage the small groups and the
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.200]   home groups to be intentional with that time because it is a long break.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.120]   We have praise and prayer, we have VBS, we have retreat, and so we have things to kind
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.440]   of occupy that time.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.480]   But at the same time, as far as our normal Bible study is concerned, there's going to
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.360]   be about a seven-week break.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.360]   And so we want to encourage you guys to be intentional and we're going to send out an
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.200]   email and talk to our small group leaders and to kind of give you some guidance in that,
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.000]   but just letting you know that's what's happening.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.040]   So if you look at the bottom of the question, review questions for Leviticus, I made it,
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.400]   somebody pointed out on number one, it says, "Try to put to memory chiastic outlining of
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.400]   the book of Revelation."
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.400]   Okay, so if you haven't done that, you're going to have to go back and review Revelation.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.000]   Obviously, I didn't mean Revelation, I meant Leviticus.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.320]   Okay, so I'm going to cross that out.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.480]   If you can review that.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.440]   So next Wednesday, we're going to get together and take some time to review the 17 chapters
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.200]   before we go on our break.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.440]   So let me pray for us and then we'll jump into the text this evening.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.260]   Gracious Father, we thank you for this evening and we thank you for all the brothers and
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.520]   sisters that you've gathered together.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.400]   Help us to glean from your word what you desire for us, that we may learn and grow and continue
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.820]   to keep you at the center of all that we do.
[00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.720]   We pray for your blessing over this time in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.440]   All right, so in the chiastic form of the book of Revelation, chapter 17 is the beginning
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.600]   of the next section.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.440]   So I kind of debated not to do 17 and wait for us to start it next time, but I don't
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.960]   think it matters too much because we're going to end up reviewing anyway.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.960]   Okay.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:16.060]   All right, so the chapter 17 is the beginning of the structure of the second part.
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:25.020]   So if you remember the chiastic form, and again, please try to put that to memory.
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.680]   And I'm not talking about, you don't have to know like what's in every single chapter,
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.860]   but at least that broad outline, right?
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.540]   Chapter 1, like A, I, 1A, and then going backwards.
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.180]   And then the last two chapters is sort of a blessing discipline response.
[00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.500]   It's sort of a summary chapter.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.680]   Okay.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.380]   But at least know the chiastic structure.
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.860]   So if I asked you what's in chapter 17, 18, 19, that you kind of have some idea that it's
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.220]   talking about the laws of cleanliness.
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.260]   If I talked, asked you what was in chapter 11 through 15, that you also know that it's
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.580]   also about laws of cleanliness.
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.580]   Okay.
[00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.080]   So at least have that structure in mind so that you know exactly where we are.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.980]   So let's say in the future you're studying and you're learning about the gospel and you
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.620]   say, well, you know, what does the Bible say about blood?
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.140]   And then you kind of have a general outline of where you would want to go in the book
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.380]   of Revelation, not Revelation, Leviticus.
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.380]   Okay.
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.380]   All right.
[00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.140]   So I'm going to ask you guys to do your best to put this to memory, this outline to memory.
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.500]   In chapter 17, fits into the number two, after the day of atonement, laws of clean and unclean
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.500]   things.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.340]   Obviously you can see from 17 to 20.
[00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:48.260]   What was the difference from the first part of the kiastic outline versus the second part?
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.140]   What is the distinction between the first part and second part?
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.380]   Or is he just going to repeat what he said in the first part?
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.660]   Do you guys remember?
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.700]   We talked about this briefly when we went over the outline the first time.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.700]   Okay, good.
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.600]   All right.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.900]   So the first part, chapter one, all the way to chapter 15, highlighted in chapter 16,
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.880]   if you look at the outline, it says almost the exact same thing.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.140]   But then the first part of it up to chapter 15, the emphasis is at the tabernacle and
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.780]   the priest, right?
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.660]   For the purpose of staying clean and pure and their sins atoned for, for the purpose
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.180]   of the tabernacle.
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.980]   The second part of it, the emphasis is in the life of the community.
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.260]   Okay.
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.140]   So it's going to follow the same outline backward, but the emphasis, it doesn't mean
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.340]   it's not going to talk about the tabernacle, it's going to talk about the priesthood, but
[00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.660]   it's working backwards, talking about with the emphasis on the community of Israel.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.340]   Okay.
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.340]   So that's where we are.
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.980]   Chapter 17 is going to kick us off into that section.
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.860]   So after the introduction in verse one and two, we go straight into the regulations concerning
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.900]   location.
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:12.500]   So the two broad outline of this chapter is regulations on the location of the sacrifice
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.340]   and regulation of eating blood.
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.980]   And it falls into verses three to nine, the first section, and then eating the blood in
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.880]   verses 10 through 16.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.020]   So that's a broad outline that if you've read it, you probably already noticed.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.580]   So everything that we're talking about is going to be falling under those two categories.
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.580]   So the regulation concerning the location is concerning the sacrificial slaughter of
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.100]   sacrificial animals.
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.580]   Let me make sure that you understand that.
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.540]   He's not talking about just any animals.
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:49.140]   These are animals that you've probably noticed in the earlier chapters where these animals,
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:55.620]   whether they were goats or whether they were different lambs or ox, all of them were animals
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.540]   that were prescribed to be offered as sacrifices at the tabernacle.
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.440]   So these weren't just any animals, right?
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.820]   So that's verse three to six.
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:12.940]   So God regulated that these three animals had to be killed either inside the tent of
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.980]   meeting or had to be brought to the tent of meeting.
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:25.220]   So all animals that was being killed had to be sacrificed inside or had to be brought
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.420]   inside after it was killed.
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:34.940]   Now on the surface, it doesn't seem like, you know, if you were to look at the degrees
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.660]   of different sins, right, what made somebody holy or unholy, you would think that the location
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.960]   of the sacrifice may not be as important.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:54.460]   But the consequence of that was very severe if you didn't follow these commands.
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:01.500]   We're going to get back to this subject later part of the outline, but the consequence was
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.820]   blood guilt shall be imputed to that man.
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.440]   And we're going to talk about what that means.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.980]   And also that man shall be cut off from among his people.
[00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:14.160]   So just even on the surface, you can tell that the consequence wasn't simply being unclean.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:21.660]   So if somebody became unclean in chapter 11 through 15, what was their prescribed remedy?
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.900]   Do you remember?
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:24.900]   Just generally.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.100]   They had to wash, right?
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:34.180]   They had to go through ritual cleansing and then what else?
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.620]   For how long were they to be unclean?
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.700]   Until evening.
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.140]   That whole day you were considered unclean.
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.020]   So next day after you've done through ritual cleansing, you can go back into the regular
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.020]   society.
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.820]   So they were impure, but it wasn't a serious consequence.
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.300]   This is not that case.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.180]   If you do not follow this prescribed what God tells you to do, you said the consequence
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.180]   is a blood guilt.
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.140]   And we're going to talk about what that means.
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.540]   And then to be cut off from among his people.
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:07.260]   So this was not simply a slap on the wrist saying, "Hey, you didn't follow instruction."
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:14.820]   This would fall into the line of what God told Moses and Aaron.
[00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.020]   Remember how chapter 16 begins?
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:24.140]   Do you remember how the day of Atonement, how does chapter 16 begin?
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.820]   He reminds him about the death of Nadab and Nebihu.
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.300]   In other words, it's serious.
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:35.100]   You need to pay really close attention to this because if you don't follow my instruction
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.080]   and you disobey, the consequences is severe.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:45.340]   So chapter 17, unlike the previous chapters, remember in the kiastic form?
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:50.820]   Like what led up to chapter 16, it was basically a slap on the hand for not being clean.
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:55.860]   But we get to chapter 17, and if you don't obey this, there's going to be serious consequences.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.860]   Right?
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:01.620]   And we'll revisit that, the meaning of it.
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.420]   He said that the sacrifice, that the animal had to be given to the Lord as a peace offering.
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.460]   Now why do you think it was a peace offering?
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.060]   What was unique about the peace offering?
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:18.100]   He said that if you're going to kill an animal, make sure that it is brought into the tent
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.260]   of meeting and it was offered as a peace offering.
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:30.940]   But what was unique about the peace offering?
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:37.980]   I can't tell if it's a blank look because you don't know, you're tired, or you're just
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.700]   being Asian.
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:49.500]   What was unique about the peace offering?
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.620]   You ate it, right?
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:56.940]   You burned only the parts you couldn't eat, most of it was shared in a meal, like a picnic.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.700]   So he's saying the animal that was sacrificed outside, bring it to God and offer it as a
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.700]   peace offering.
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:07.660]   In other words, if you want to have a barbecue, kill the animal, bring it, sprinkle the blood
[00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.340]   on the altar, and then you can have this meal that you're going to have, that you're going
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.860]   to do it in the presence of God, share it with the priest and your family.
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:27.980]   That these particular animals were to be eaten together in the context of honoring God.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:36.460]   But the ultimate reason why he was preventing them to do that, he says in verse 5, that
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.460]   this was to prevent Israel from sacrificing to goat demons.
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:46.660]   He doesn't explain specifically what these goat demons are, but we know from history
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:51.940]   that this pagan sacrifice that involved this goat demon that he's talking about was something
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.740]   the Israelites picked up when they were in Egypt.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:00.220]   And they never completely got rid of it.
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:08.700]   In fact, Israel wrestled with this as long as they existed.
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:14.460]   Even in the wilderness, even from the very beginning, they escaped from Egypt, they're
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:19.300]   on the other side of the Red Sea, and you would think that they're starting over, we're
[00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:24.060]   only going to worship God, but right off the bat, before the Ten Commandments comes, they
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.760]   begin worshiping the calf.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.140]   And then you would think that after the judgment comes and half the Israelite camp is destroyed,
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.980]   that they would have learned their lesson, and then it didn't show up again.
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:43.220]   But if you look at Israel's history, this idolatry was in the camp as long as they existed.
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.060]   In some periods, it was heavier than others.
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:51.740]   So this goat demon that I was just talking about was prevalent enough where he was mentioning
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:58.620]   that they didn't want the sacrifices to be given anywhere, right?
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.820]   Concerned that it may be something that they would offer up to the goat demon.
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:09.780]   In fact, Joshua, chapter 24, 14 to 15, at the end of his life, I mean, you know this
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:14.500]   famous verse where it says, "Now therefore fear the Lord and serve him in sincerity and
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.500]   in faithfulness.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.220]   Put away the gods that your father served beyond the river and in Egypt and serve the
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.220]   Lord."
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.580]   By the time Joshua is here, they've already gone into the promised land.
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.620]   He's at the end of his life when he's saying this.
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.320]   So this isn't like a couple of years removed from Egypt.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:34.960]   So the idolatry that they had in Egypt was never completely abolished.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.740]   And that's why he's saying, it's about time that you make your decision.
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:38.740]   Are you going to serve God?
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.180]   Are you going to keep looking back to Egypt?
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.620]   If it is evil in your eyes to serve the Lord, choose this day from whom you will serve,
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.220]   whether the gods of your father served in region beyond the river.
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:55.260]   Obviously talking about Egypt and the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell.
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.940]   But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord again.
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:06.280]   So we know that the Israelites, even at the peak of their success, even out in the desert,
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:12.700]   they wrestled with this.
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:20.180]   Where after the kingdom splits, you had King Saul, King David, King Solomon, and after
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:25.040]   that Jeroboam and Rohoboam, the two kingdoms split, the northern kingdom and then the southern
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.380]   kingdom, if you know Israel's history.
[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:36.780]   The northern kingdom, led by Jeroboam, they set up two separate sites in direct rebellion
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:41.820]   against God, where God said only to make sacrifices, where he prescribed it.
[00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.420]   He sets up two different places, Dan and Bethel.
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:52.020]   He remakes the golden calf, introduces that as Yahweh, because he was concerned that after
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:55.860]   the kingdom split, that people were going to keep going down to Jerusalem to worship
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.460]   God and he was afraid that he was going to lose his people.
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:03.700]   So in order to keep the people that he took out with him, he set up two separate places.
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.100]   That was detestable before God's eyes.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:11.700]   All throughout the northern kingdom's history, God continues to mention that as a stench
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.700]   before him.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:17.860]   And as a result of this rebellion, of this disobedience, that eventually God was going
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.740]   to bring destruction upon the northern kingdom.
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.260]   That's exactly what happens.
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:27.140]   The southern kingdom, on the other hand, they were better, but they weren't good.
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:33.180]   If you remember the southern kingdom's history, majority of their kings were evil as well.
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:39.460]   And their problem was, even though they didn't have the same issue as the northern kingdom,
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:44.860]   the southern kingdom kept on establishing the altar in the high places.
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:49.700]   So if you read through Old Testament history, you'll see over and over again in the southern
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:55.260]   kingdom, God says that revival can't be yet, they kept on establishing, kept on offering
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.860]   to God in the high places.
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:02.260]   And basically what that means was, the way that the pagans in the places where they would
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.880]   offer sacrifices were usually on top of hills.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:10.860]   And so when the Israelites were making offerings, even when it was to Yahweh, it was done in
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.740]   the wrong place.
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.760]   Where God specifically told them in Leviticus chapter 17, that all the sacrifices needed
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.960]   to be made where God prescribed it to be.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.980]   So we see evidence of this.
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.460]   This was not a small problem in Israel.
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:32.780]   All throughout Israel's history, they disobeyed this command in chapter 17.
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.100]   This regulation applied both to the Israelites and to the strangers.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:41.560]   So you'll notice, if you read chapter 17, that he mentions two or three separate times
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:46.140]   that this applies to Israelites and all the strangers and the sojourners that come into
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.320]   Israel.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:53.060]   Which signifies that this law was to be kept, not only for the sake of the individual, but
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.900]   also for the community.
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:00.700]   That these sacrifices were not simply meant just for a personal relationship with God,
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:08.660]   but to keep the community of Israel clean.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:14.740]   I want you to really remember this, because I don't know how many of you are reading through
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.780]   the Bible this year, whether you're reading two chapters or three chapters.
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:26.220]   This sin is repeated in almost every single book of the Old Testament.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:31.020]   Almost every single book in every period of Israel's history, where they are worshipping
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.180]   God in a different place.
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.820]   And so on the surface, it may look like, "Oh, what's the big deal?
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.540]   He gave a sacrifice to God, but he did it in a high place."
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.940]   It was a specific disobedience to this particular command.
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:51.440]   And this happened over and over again.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:58.520]   This section, chapter, verses 10, all the way to the end of the chapter, regulation
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.960]   concerning eating of blood.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.880]   This was a huge, huge deal.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.860]   God warns Israel that eating blood of an animal would cause his face to set against the person,
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.980]   for him to be cut off from among his people.
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:22.260]   What does it mean for God's face to be set against somebody?
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.700]   The whole point of Israel's history is to get the blessing of God, right?
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:30.020]   So Psalm chapter 1, remember how Psalm chapter 1 begins?
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.340]   "Blessed is the man," right?
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:35.140]   How did the Jews greet each other?
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:38.940]   "Shalom," peace, right?
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.780]   Not my peace, not your peace, but may God's peace be upon you.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:46.820]   So the whole Israel's history, Israel's culture is to receive the Lord's blessing.
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:51.300]   So when God says, "If you do not obey this command, his face is going to be set against
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.300]   you."
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.900]   In other words, God's peace is going to leave you, right?
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.500]   So whatever it is that you're seeking from the Lord, you're not going to get.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.180]   So he's turning his face.
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.260]   Not only is God going to turn from you, he said, "You're going to be cut off from your
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.280]   own people."
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.520]   So the consequence of this is serious.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.700]   This was not just a slap on the hand saying, "Hey, don't do this again."
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:19.500]   In fact, the two reasons why he gives why you must not eat the blood is one, the life
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:24.060]   of the flesh is in the blood, and then the second was related to it.
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:29.100]   Because the life of the flesh is in the blood, the blood was reserved to make atonement.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:33.740]   So in other words, in God's eyes, the blood was considered very, very sacred.
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.940]   So if you put this in your mouth, he said, basically, you're drinking condemnation upon
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:38.940]   yourself.
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:48.740]   In fact, the blood was so sacred that if a man found an animal who was already dead,
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:55.060]   whether by natural causes or it was eaten by a beast, that that animal's blood was supposed
[00:18:55.060 --> 00:19:01.140]   to be spilt, drained of its blood, and then to be covered up with dirt.
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.140]   You're not supposed to just leave the dirt out in the open.
[00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:13.340]   So the only place where the blood could be spilt and splattered, both on the altar, on
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:20.340]   the animal, upon the priests, and then the people themselves, was in the context of sacrifice.
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.940]   In any other place, they said it was forbidden.
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:27.220]   It was forbidden, even if you spill it, you have to cover it, right?
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.220]   And you're not supposed to do that.
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.400]   And if you do do that, you're supposed to bring it into the tabernacle and give it as
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:37.100]   a peace offering.
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:42.940]   And then whoever eats this, eats an animal that was killed outside of the camp, that
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:48.920]   he had to go through ritual cleansing, he was considered unclean.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:55.540]   And this is repeated, I put four times, but if you, depending on how you count it, it's
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.220]   actually mentioned six separate times in this passage.
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:03.280]   I mentioned four, but within those verses, there are a couple others that are mentioned,
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.440]   right?
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:10.280]   So whenever something is repeated repetitiously, what does that tell us?
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:19.240]   Extremely, extremely, extremely important, right?
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:25.920]   So anything said once from God, you pay attention, even if he just says it in passing, you don't
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.120]   just skip over whatever God says.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:33.480]   If he says it twice, you pay very close attention to it because God for sure is trying to get
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.480]   your attention.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:39.960]   If he says it three times, you're supposed to sit there and memorize this thing, right?
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.880]   God is holy, holy, holy.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.700]   That is not by accident.
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:50.760]   This commandment is repeated over and over and over and over and over and over in this
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.640]   text.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:59.000]   So if you were to read this like a Jew, if there was any text that you put to memory,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.440]   that you make sure that you don't disobey, it would have been this part because it is
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.880]   repeated over and over and over again, right?
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:17.040]   This is how important this was.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:24.120]   Any violation of these regulations brought very severe consequences, right?
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:29.880]   With the exception of the last part, what we just talked about, if a man eating an animal,
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:36.600]   this section, it says it was not considered a misdemeanor, but we would probably consider
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.680]   that a felony or even a capital offense.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.920]   In fact, that's the language that's being used here.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:47.080]   The transgression, in most of the violations, identified as blood guiltiness.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.320]   If you violate it, you will be guilty of blood guiltiness.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:54.880]   And this is an expression used for murder.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:02.200]   So this was equated with the same consequence as murder, to eat of the blood of the animal.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.120]   That's how serious, that's how sacred this was.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:13.240]   So if there was anything considered sacrilegious that a Jew would have understood, and it wasn't
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:17.120]   just by chance, it wasn't just part of the culture because this is the way God communicated
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:23.200]   that, that if you eat drink of the blood, God's going to turn his face from you, you're
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:27.480]   going to be guilty of blood guilt, in other words, of murder, and then you're going to
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.280]   be cast out from the society.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:34.600]   So basically, what was it?
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:39.440]   It was no different than getting leprosy.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:45.400]   The consequence of drinking blood in violation of God's command was no different than getting
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.400]   leprosy.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.120]   It was basically a death sentence.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.720]   That's how sacred, that's how important this was.
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:58.360]   Then the second part of it, obviously, talks about being cut off.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:07.040]   Now, I want you to think about what you know about the blood and what the scripture teaches
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:14.240]   about the blood in the New Covenant, and now think of it as a Jew.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.800]   If there's one thing that you would have never done as a Jew, you would have eaten blood.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.040]   There's a lot of things you wouldn't have done, right?
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.880]   I mean, if you went into a house where somebody was during their monthly flow, you would have
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.520]   become unclean, if you eat in certain kind of foods, you would have become unclean, if
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.560]   you touch sacred things, you would have been unclean.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:38.080]   There's a lot of things that the Jew would have avoided, but if there's one thing that
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:44.440]   they probably made sure that they never did was drink the blood of an animal, right?
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.880]   Because it was a death sentence.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.340]   It wasn't just a slap.
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.760]   You can't be cured.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.200]   At the end of the day, you go through ritual cleansing.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.960]   He says, "God's going to turn his face from you.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.960]   You're going to be cut off.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.040]   You're going to be guilty of murder."
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:01.840]   Now, having said that, that's what a Jew would have understood, and then we come to the New
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.320]   Testament.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.080]   What does Jesus say?
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:14.200]   "If you do not drink of my blood and eat of my flesh, I have no relationship with you."
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:19.360]   So imagine how shocking this would have been to a Jew, right?
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:25.760]   Living for hundreds of years, thinking that if you eat the blood of an animal, that you
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.160]   will die, that God is going to curse you, right?
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.800]   You're going to be cast out of the camp.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.680]   Now, Jesus says this, if you know John chapter 6, in the context of people whose hearts were
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.060]   hardened, right?
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:43.500]   They were following Jesus, because this is right after he fed the 5,000, and Jesus calls
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.280]   them out because he sees ingenuine faith, and he's telling them that, "I am the bread
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.560]   of life," and they wouldn't believe him.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.600]   So he's talking to a group of people whose hearts were already hardened, and he's talking
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.060]   to unbelievers, right?
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:00.120]   And so he tells them, and obviously this is clearly he's pointing to what he's about to
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:04.120]   do on the cross, and when he says, "Drink my blood, eat of my flesh," obviously he's
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.640]   talking about symbolically, right?
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.640]   He was going to shed his blood, and his body was going to be broken for our sins.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.240]   He doesn't explain this to them, right?
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.820]   But he says, "You must drink of my blood."
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:20.040]   And as a result of that, he says, "This is too hard," right?
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:25.720]   And even though they were coming, and these are the same group of people in chapter 6
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:30.840]   who wanted to make him king, just 20 verses before this.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:35.640]   They were going to forcefully make him king because they ate the miraculous food, they
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:41.760]   saw a lot of these guys saw Jesus walking on water, they saw him healing the lame, opening
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:46.680]   the eyes of the man who was blind, they were convinced that he was the Messiah.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.720]   But because of this statement, they walk away, right?
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:56.160]   So John chapter 6, 66, he says, "Many of the disciples turned away and no longer followed
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.600]   Jesus because of this statement."
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:03.080]   So as a Jew, you can understand why this was a difficult thing for them to, right?
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:09.020]   But Jesus says actually quite a bit of things like that.
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:12.900]   In the Old Testament, and some of you guys mentioned how you guys went together for the
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:17.420]   gospel and one of the speakers talked about how God forbid Adam and Eve to eat of the
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.840]   tree and yet Jesus says, "You must eat of me."
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.520]   If you eat of this, you will die, but if you want to live, you must eat of me.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:29.920]   He tells in chapter 17 that you cannot drink the blood and yet in the New Testament, if
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.660]   you want to live, you must drink my blood, right?
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:39.840]   In every other situation, it would have brought condemnation, but only the blood of Christ,
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:45.740]   only the flesh of Christ, his true bread would have reversed that curse, right?
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:50.600]   You know what's interesting is, again, there's another office that was forbidden.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:55.580]   Over and over again in Israel's history, whenever a king touched the sacrifices, because those
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:27:00.900]   offices were never to be mixed, only the priest could make sacrifices and king were supposed
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:01.900]   to rule.
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.820]   Kings could not make sacrifices and priests could never become king.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:11.500]   Jesus comes and he's a king who's a priest, right?
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:16.580]   He comes in the order of Melchizedek, so that particular office was reserved for Jesus and
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:21.580]   Jesus only and anybody else who touched that was judged by God.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:28.340]   So in the same way, there are things that was reserved that was only meant for Christ.
[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:34.020]   You know what's again, interesting is that the sacrifice, where was the sacrifice meant
[00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.020]   to be made?
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:38.980]   Outside the camp or inside the camp?
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:44.900]   Inside the camp at the tabernacle and if you make the sacrifice outside, right, you'd be
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.700]   guilty.
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.980]   Where was Jesus sacrificed?
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:50.980]   Outside the camp.
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:57.500]   Now what is the significance of that?
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:02.140]   I want you guys to just think through what you see in the New Testament and what you're
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:06.300]   learning in the book of Leviticus because all of these things have significance to a
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.300]   Jew.
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.660]   So if somebody was sacrificed outside the camp, chapter 17 says you must not sacrifice
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.300]   outside the camp, right?
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:19.740]   When Christ comes, he sacrifices outside the camp, meaning the sacredness of Israel has
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.380]   left.
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:26.100]   So Jesus not only is sacrificed outside the camp, what does he do?
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:30.860]   As he's sacrificed outside the camp, what does he say?
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.020]   To come outside with him, right?
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.740]   To come join him outside the camp.
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:42.900]   When John the Baptist comes, he comes in and he's a prophet, right?
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.060]   And he doesn't come through the system of the Pharisees.
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.340]   Where does he go?
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:48.340]   Outside.
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:55.820]   He preaches out in the wilderness, outside of the epicenter of the Jewish religion, right?
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.380]   All of these things have significance.
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:03.340]   So what was considered sacred now is because God has turned his face from them, now God
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.340]   is calling them outside.
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.740]   Instead of coming in, he calls them outside.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.460]   Christ is sacrificed outside.
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:09.500]   He says don't drink the blood.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.300]   Jesus says no, but drink my blood.
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:17.140]   Don't eat the flesh, but he said no, you have to eat my flesh, right?
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:22.780]   I want you guys to let this percolate in your head because all of this has specific meanings,
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:24.140]   right?
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:29.940]   In 1 Peter 1, 18-19, it said, "Knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:34.180]   from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:37.420]   precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot."
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:44.380]   So here in 1 Peter 1, 18, it says, "The blood of Christ ransomed us."
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:48.340]   Ephesians 1, 7, "In him we have redemption through his blood."
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.980]   Again, all of these things point to the sacredness of the blood.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:56.020]   Colossians 1, 20, "And through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.700]   in heaven, making peace by the blood of Christ."
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:05.500]   So we are ransomed, we are redeemed, and peace was brought through the blood.
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:09.940]   And then Revelation 1, 5, it says, "And from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.380]   of the dead, and the ruler of the kings on the earth, to him who loves us and has freed
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.780]   us from our sins by his blood."
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:21.460]   We are ransomed, we're redeemed, we were made peace by his blood.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:24.780]   We were freed from our sins by his blood.
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:29.260]   And then Hebrews 9, 22, it says, "Without shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:32.140]   of sins."
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:41.580]   So chapter 17 reserves the drinking of the blood as sacred because the life of the animal
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:47.960]   is in the blood, and that life was meant to be for the purpose of atoning sins.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.020]   That ultimately pointed to Christ.
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:57.660]   And so we come to the New Testament, it points to the sacredness, not of the animal's blood,
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:03.660]   but chapter 17 points to the sacredness of the blood of Christ.
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.340]   You follow?
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:11.620]   Because all that is happening in the book of Leviticus is to prepare, it's kind of like
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:17.300]   learning the ABC so you would learn how to write poetry and novels later on.
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:23.020]   So the root understanding of the sacrifice of Christ is mentioned in chapter 17 so that
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:28.460]   Israel understood the sacredness of the blood, that without the shedding of blood, there
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:32.360]   is no sacrifice, there is no forgiveness of sins.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:36.260]   And so therefore, blood is sacred.
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.000]   That's what was embedded into their culture.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.100]   So when Christ comes, he says, "No, this blood you must drink because my life is in
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.100]   this blood.
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:50.420]   And if you don't drink of my life, you cannot live."
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:54.420]   And that's the language that we see here in Hebrews 10.29, "How much worse punishment
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.660]   do you think will be deserved by the one who has spurned the Son of God and has profaned
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.940]   the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified and has outraged the Spirit of
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.420]   grace?"
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:12.460]   So if in the Old Testament, profaning the blood of an animal caused capital punishment,
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:18.420]   how much more when somebody profanes the blood of Christ, spurns his grace, in other words,
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:19.420]   rejects it.
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:24.700]   Ultimately, that's what he's talking about.
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:29.180]   Christ shed his blood for them and he doesn't consider it sacred and he rejects it.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.780]   So remember the scripture talks about there's one sin that cannot be forgiven, it's the
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.700]   blasphemy of the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.340]   And what is that sin?
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:41.820]   Rejection of the blood of Christ.
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:49.220]   So all of this to teach the sacredness of what it is that we already have in Christ
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.380]   as a Christian.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:58.780]   And to not to live day to day recognizing what it is that's been done for us.
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.340]   You know, we're kind of like, "Yeah, Jesus died for us on the cross."
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:05.820]   And the longer you've been a Christian, the less and less fantastic it becomes.
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.180]   Like you were excited when you were beginning, when you were telling your testimony, but
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:14.540]   after you've been a Christian for 10, 15 years, you're kind of like, "Okay, what else?"
[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:18.380]   And part of that, or a lot of that, is because we don't understand the weight of what it
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.440]   is that has been done for us.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.020]   And that's what Revelation was for.
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:28.920]   And so the Jews had that embedded into their culture for hundreds and hundreds of years.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:33.620]   So when they heard, when they understand the blood of Christ, they already had all the
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:34.620]   ABCs.
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:38.540]   They went from elementary, you know, from kindergarten all the way up to college and
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:42.660]   they're getting their PhDs in Christ, but they kind of took the proper steps to get
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:43.660]   there.
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:47.100]   Gentiles, you and I, we jump in at the PhD.
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:50.620]   And so we graduate, but we don't know how to do the math.
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:52.520]   We don't know how we got here.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.900]   That's why the study of the Old Testament is so important.
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:34:00.460]   Because we know the answer, we don't know how we got to the answer.
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:01.460]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:02.460]   We cheated.
[00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:05.260]   We went to the back of the book and we found the numbers and we filled in the dots and
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:10.060]   we passed the test and we got our PhD, but we don't know how we got here.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:14.820]   And so it's important for us to study Leviticus and numbers and different books because all
[00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:18.820]   of these things were stepping stones that led to the cross.
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.180]   You understand?
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:24.660]   And why we're going back, you look at the book of Hebrews and Galatians and Romans,
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:29.700]   why it makes so much more sense once you know what God was doing in the Old Testament.
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:30.880]   Right?
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:36.660]   So my point is, if you've been sleeping through the Bible study all this time, to
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:39.260]   wake up because it is important.
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:44.180]   It's going to affect how you understand the New Testament in a different level, the more
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.420]   you understand what we're talking about Leviticus.
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.420]   Okay?
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:48.420]   All right.
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.600]   So that's where we're going to be ending it today.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.340]   Next week we're going to do a review.
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:57.420]   So if you, some of you, and I know the study of Leviticus is not easy.
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.720]   It's not something that you can jump in in the middle and then just kind of, you know,
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.900]   like you're doing the epistles, you really need to kind of wrestle with it.
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:09.540]   So I'm pretty sure even if you've been following, there's probably gaps in your understanding.
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:16.900]   So what I'm going to ask you to do is we're going to take some time to review.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.840]   We're going to take next session.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:22.620]   And then the first session that we have after we come back from our break, I'm going to
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.820]   try to answer some of your questions.
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:25.820]   Okay?
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:30.660]   So next week I'm going to do an overview study or just a review.
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:36.060]   And then if you can send in, okay, if you can email and send in, like, I don't understand
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:37.060]   it.
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:38.180]   Can you re-explain this?
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:43.060]   And I'm going to try to touch upon some of that to try to get you up to speed so that
[00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:46.660]   next time we open this up, you'll be at a better place.
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:50.100]   So you don't kind of feel like you're lost and you're just kind of getting bits and pieces.
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:51.100]   Okay?
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:57.260]   So I'm going to ask you to take the initiative if you're lost, say, "Hey, can you cover this?"
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.700]   But don't say, "Can you cover all of it?"
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.060]   Because obviously I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:04.100]   Be specific and I'll try to target some of that.
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.100]   Okay?
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.100]   All right.
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.860]   So the discussion question, God made it very clear that he did not want his people to worship
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:12.620]   him in a manner that reflected pagan worship.
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:17.140]   Where do we draw the line between worship that reflects the world and biblical God-centered
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.140]   worship?
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.140]   You understand the question?
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.380]   All right?
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:25.180]   God made it very clear that he didn't want the worship of Yahweh to look anything like
[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:30.140]   pagan worship, like the demon goat or goat demon worship.
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:31.140]   Right?
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:36.580]   So today, and I'm not saying that that's what it is today, but if we're not careful, we're
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:45.540]   so concerned about making non-Christians comfortable in the church that we could easily, not deliberately,
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:50.620]   but easily twist certain things to make it more comfortable and the next thing you know,
[00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:55.620]   the worship of God starts to look like, you know, some rock concert or whatever.
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.620]   Right?
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:57.620]   But where do we draw the line?
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:00.860]   Number two, why do we think idolatry was so attractive to the Israelites?
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:04.500]   In what form is idolatry practiced today?
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:08.600]   Obviously, we don't have the same kind of idolatry we have in the Old Testament where
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:13.540]   you actually have figures that they bow down to, but idolatry is described as anything
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.700]   that takes the place of God in worship.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.300]   So do we worship idols today?
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:19.300]   Yes.
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.740]   It's just not carved out by hands.
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:22.740]   Right?
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:27.540]   Worship money, worship success, worship family, worship children.
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.900]   Right?
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:32.140]   Why were these things so attractive to the nation of Israel?
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:36.780]   They had the living God who was performing miracles and God was speaking to them and
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.700]   yet they kept on falling back to idolatry.
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:43.220]   What was going on in their heads?
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.180]   And why was it so attractive?
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.780]   And then how does that reflect what's happening today?
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:48.780]   Right?
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.220]   Number three, the communion table is partaking of Christ's blood and flesh to remember
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.780]   his sacrifice for us.
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:58.100]   So take a few minutes to read 1 Corinthians 11, 26 to 32.
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.740]   How seriously should we be taking the communion table?
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:06.260]   So in 1 Corinthians 11, 26 to 32, basically it says some people were falling sick or even
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:11.540]   dying because they were not taking the covenant cup seriously.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.720]   Right?
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:17.660]   So even in the New Testament communion table, the communion table was considered very sacred
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:22.180]   and we see that ideology embedded in what we studied today in chapter 17.
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.180]   Right?
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.580]   The blood was considered sacred.
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:28.580]   So the blood of Christ that we partake in was considered sacred.
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:34.260]   So anybody participating in a nonchalant manner where unconfessed sins and in that context
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:38.740]   where they were ignoring the poor brothers and it was causing division in the church.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.740]   So as a result of that, some were actually falling sick and dying.
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.460]   Just like it says in chapter 17.
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.460]   Right?
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.900]   So how important is communion table today?
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:47.900]   Right?
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:52.820]   At least in our attitude that it is a sacred time and that's why we always say that this
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:55.900]   is reserved for people who are repentant sinners.
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:56.900]   Right?
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:04.100]   So it's not meant for the non-Christians and I know, you know, I know a church, a pastor,
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:08.940]   and I'm not going to say because I think, you know, many of you will know, and I remember
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:14.300]   having a serious conversation with him because he was opening up the communion table to non-Christians
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.980]   and he was asking non-Christians to come.
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.700]   So I was very concerned about what I heard.
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:23.460]   So I went and talked to him and I said, "Hey, I heard that you're doing this and is this
[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:24.460]   true?"
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:28.500]   And he told me that he was doing it because he didn't want the non-Christians to feel
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.340]   awkward during that time.
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:32.340]   You know?
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:36.180]   And so obviously we had a serious discussion about that and he didn't like what I had to
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:41.860]   say, you know, but it was like even the communion table was open because they're concerned about
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:46.500]   the non-Christians but communion is meant to be a sacred time, a sacred place.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.500]   Right?
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.500]   So take some time to discuss this in your small group.
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:57.780]   Then let me pray for us and I'll have you guys go into your small group.
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.460]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your blessing.
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:06.300]   We thank you, Lord God, for all these intricate details that help us to understand what it
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.100]   is that we already have in Christ.
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:15.260]   The sacred blood, Lord God, that was shed for us and each time we think of our own lives,
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:22.620]   Lord God, it's because you've imputed your righteousness in us and by your sacred blood
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.540]   of your flesh that was broken on our behalf.
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:30.580]   Help us to understand the depth of grace and depth of love that we have in you that
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:37.180]   we would not walk nonchalantly, Lord God, as if it's a peripheral priority in our lives.
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:42.420]   Help us to see the importance of it, Lord, that we may be consumed with it, to understand
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:48.700]   the depth of what it is that we have, that our life would truly be a reasonable response.
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.540]   Bless our time of discussion.
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:54.940]   I pray that you would help us to be open and honest and as iron sharpening iron, let us
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:59.820]   be sharpened as a result. In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
