[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.920]   So, this morning, if you would please take your Bibles and turn to 2 Thessalonians.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.080]   2 Thessalonians.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:25.400]   And this passage, as a fair warning or disclaimer at the beginning of the sermon, if you've
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.880]   heard me preach before, I typically like to give a very simplistic or I guess clear outline.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.640]   Point one, two, three, and then a conclusion.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.920]   This sermon's gonna feel a lot different in that I have many passages to walk through
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.920]   together.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.160]   So, just as a disclaimer first, we're gonna be turning to lots of passages together and
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.080]   trying to get the thrust and the gist of the message.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:57.640]   What I'll do is read 2 Thessalonians 2 verses 1-7, we'll pray and jump into the message.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:05.120]   It says, "Now we request you, brethren, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.820]   and our gathering together to Him, that you not be quickly shaken from your composure
[00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.840]   or be disturbed either by a spirit or a message or a letter as if from us, to the effect that
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.320]   the day of the Lord has come.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.120]   That no one in any way deceive you, for it will not come unless the apostasy comes first
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.480]   and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, who opposes and exalts
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.680]   himself above every so-called God or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.480]   temple of God, displaying himself as being God.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.740]   Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I was telling you these things?
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.020]   And you know what restrains him now, so that in his time he will be revealed, for the mystery
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.600]   of lawlessness is already at work.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.880]   Only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way."
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.240]   Let's take a moment to go before the Lord and pray.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.080]   Our God, we want to thank you for your word.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.840]   Lord, every week and God, during the week, we try together, Lord, to study your word.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.840]   We try to learn and we pray that you will cause that all to be fruitful.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.440]   God, we pray that your truth will truly impact our minds and our hearts, not simply teaching
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.640]   us facts, but God, causing us to be understanding.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.020]   And what's more today, as we talk about and learn from your scripture about the coming
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.360]   of the Lord, I pray, God, that you will cause us not only to know, but be ready.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.760]   I pray, Father, Lord, the posture of our entire bodies, our minds, and our hearts will be
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.160]   directed, Lord, eagerly seeking the return of our Savior.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.040]   And I pray, Father, God, that everything that we're doing will be interpreted in that light.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.040]   God, we thank you.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.040]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.040]   Amen.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.040]   Okay.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.280]   So, I want to...
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.640]   The reason why this sermon is going to be a little bit different is because I pretty
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.440]   much want to take you down my personal experience of walking through this passage.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.640]   I've been doing devotions in this passage.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.280]   And so, a lot of the reflections that I have, I want to share with you.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.640]   Now, in sharing with you how I got there, you know in our Bible study, midweek Bible
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.160]   study, we've been studying Philippians chapter 1 and 2 so far.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.480]   A passage I'd like to reiterate and remind us of.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.480]   Just listen.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.160]   Apostle Paul says, "Conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.760]   that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I will hear of you that you're standing
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.600]   firm in one spirit, one mind, striving together for the faith of the gospel."
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.320]   Okay.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.600]   That is such a profound but often repeated command in the Bible, yes?
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.800]   Almost every letter in the New Testament when Apostle Paul is teaching, he commands us to
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.400]   live worthy of the gospel and desires us to rise.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.880]   To not just simply take the gift of God as something light and say, "Why, thank you."
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.800]   And then to simply live as we were previously, but actually to have our lives be sanctified
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.040]   by this gospel, yes?
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.040]   Now, what's really interesting is in verse 28, this is from Philippians chapter 1, 28,
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.280]   he says, "But in no way be alarmed by your opponents, which is a sign of destruction
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.680]   for them, but of salvation for you."
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.780]   Okay, pause right there.
[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.960]   My thought has been thinking and ruminating about that phrase.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.800]   He challenged us to a great height of living worthy of the gospel, and then he tells you,
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.760]   "Don't be alarmed because you have opponents.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.640]   Don't be alarmed because you're suffering."
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.960]   And he says, "This is a sign, a sign of a destruction for those who oppose you and a
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.960]   sign of salvation for you."
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.040]   So in our standing firm, striving, and trying to live the gospel, there is this element
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:10.240]   of you understanding your current circumstance in light of the gospel you're living and making
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.920]   sense of the fact that you're going to have opponents.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.920]   Accepting the fact that this living worthy is not easy at all, right?
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.040]   As a matter of fact, you trying to live worthy is going to be hit with constant walls, not
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.520]   just from your own flesh, but from the persecution that is around you, from those who hate God
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.240]   and the gospel.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.280]   And what's more, all of that is supposed to be seen by you.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.520]   You're supposed to see and be like, "That's right, this is happening.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.200]   This is a sign that you're supposed to see," right?
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.720]   As opposed to, and we talked about this in Bible study, where oftentimes if we're hit
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.600]   with suffering, something doesn't go right, like, "I'm trying to give you like the most
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.360]   precious gift ever, the love of Jesus," and people just shove that back in your face,
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.360]   you're confused.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.800]   You're thinking, "What's going on?
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.800]   What gives?
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.120]   Did I not do this right?"
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.640]   There is this confusion sometimes, but Apostle Paul is challenging us, "Don't be alarmed."
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.840]   And in order to build a context to how I got then to 2 Thessalonians, turn to chapter 1
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.460]   of the 2 Thessalonians, please.
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.680]   And I'd like to read to you verse 3 through 5.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.580]   2 Thessalonians 1, verse 3 through 5.
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.040]   And as I kind of guide us, again, there is no clear 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 outline.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.960]   I'm going to just say, we're just going to move by the passages.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.520]   So here's the first passage.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.580]   2 Thessalonians 1, verses 3 through 5.
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.800]   He says this, "We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brethren.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.360]   It's only fitting because your faith is greatly enlarged and the love of each one of you toward
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.960]   one another grows ever greater.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.480]   Therefore we ourselves speak proudly of you among the churches of God for your perseverance
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:58.600]   and faith in the midst of all your persecutions and afflictions which you endured."
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.820]   So he's talking to the Thessalonians.
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:06.080]   And similarly to the Philippians, they're experiencing a ton of persecution and affliction.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.080]   But then take a look at this.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:13.960]   Verse 5, "This is a plain indication of God's righteous judgment so that you will be considered
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.240]   worthy of the kingdom of God for which indeed you are suffering."
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.680]   What am I saying?
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.320]   There was kind of a corollary or at least a connection of thought there.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:30.800]   Our living the gospel and then receiving persecution and receiving hardship should be a sign for
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.800]   us.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.800]   Here, he's saying, "All of that persecution and affliction you endured, this is great
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.760]   and I'm praising you for it.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.560]   This is a plain indication."
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.920]   It's also a sign of what?
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.100]   Of God's righteous judgment.
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.080]   I'm going to read further down.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:53.380]   Verse 6 and forward, it says, "For after all, it is only just for God to repay with affliction
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.640]   those who afflict you."
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.640]   Whoa.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.280]   Have you guys read that and just paused for a second?
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.380]   That sounds serious, right?
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:09.380]   It's only right for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you?
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.860]   Well, let's keep reading.
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:16.060]   "And to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when the Lord Jesus will
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:22.100]   be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels and flaming fire, dealing out retribution
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:28.180]   to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.780]   These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction away from the presence of the Lord and from
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:38.100]   the glory of his power when he comes to be glorified in his saints on that day and be
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:43.020]   marveled at among all who have believed for our testimony to you is believed.
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:48.260]   To this end also, we pray for you always that our God will count you worthy of your calling
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:53.040]   and fulfill every desire for goodness and the work of faith with power so that the name
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.580]   of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you and you in him according to the grace of our
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.580]   Lord and the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.060]   Okay.
[00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:11.000]   So with that passage, this is I want us to have our minds think about something here.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.060]   And the question is, what's next?
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.400]   I titled this sermon, "What's Next?"
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:22.100]   Because we should be thinking about what is coming in the future, in the years to come,
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:27.540]   the next kind of timeline of God's plan of redemption, what's next?
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.700]   Okay?
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:36.060]   And clearly, this is really sobering because this passage is reminding us, remember, Christ's
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.540]   return.
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.820]   Christ is going to return in a fashion where it is dramatic.
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:45.900]   I mean, I don't know what else words to use, but incredibly dramatic.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:51.060]   Mighty angels and flaming fire dealing out retribution, afflicting those who are against
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.900]   the gospel and against the people of God.
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.340]   Wow.
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.820]   That's pretty profound stuff.
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:04.100]   But I would like us to take a moment here and now and to ask, first and foremost, I
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.500]   have to start thinking, am I living with that kind of expectation?
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.260]   Right?
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.740]   Am I perceiving that that is actually next?
[00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:19.260]   That's a huge, huge frame of thought, mentality, perspective, you can call it a worldview that
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.820]   we're going to be regularly challenged with.
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.940]   And it's so important.
[00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:29.700]   Let me emphasize how important it is by giving us a silly example of driving.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.900]   You know how frustrating it is when the driver in front of you has no idea where they're
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:34.900]   going.
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:35.900]   Yes?
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.500]   Of course, it's never you, it's the guy in front of you.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.540]   They're driving, maybe they're like distracted, they're on their phones, they look up, fork
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.540]   in the road, they don't know what to do.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.020]   What do they normally do?
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.300]   They slam on the brakes.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.260]   And you have to swerve, and one time that actually happened to me, I had to go into
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.500]   like a construction zone.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.020]   Sure enough, that guy ended up going, oh, they go this way, and then a cop pulled up
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.860]   next to me and gave me a ticket for going into the construction zone.
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.620]   Please don't ever do that, okay?
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.740]   If you're lost, don't slam on the brakes in the middle of the road, just go.
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.340]   And then fully safely pull off.
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.160]   Why do I give you a silly example?
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.140]   You know how frustrating it is when someone doesn't know where they're going, and because
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.780]   of that, they can't do anything else but stop.
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.260]   Yes?
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:24.020]   Other driving scenarios, if you yourself, you're getting directions from your navigator,
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.100]   your passenger, and they're giving you directions, right?
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.360]   And they're telling you, oh, turn here, turn there, everything's fine.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.700]   But they say something confusing like, oh, next turn, this one, go.
[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.900]   You're like, wait a minute, this one or the next one?
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.500]   Because the next one's technically after this one.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.900]   But did you mean this one?
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.420]   And then it's like, there it goes, right?
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.420]   You miss it.
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.580]   Now you're all upset at each other, like, dude, can you be a little bit more clear?
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.160]   If it's this, just say this.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.540]   If it's next, say next.
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.540]   You guys have never had that?
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.540]   All right.
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:55.900]   The reason why I gave you this silly example is because if you do not know what's coming
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:01.540]   up, oftentimes you're going too fast to stop, or you have to pump your brakes and you don't
[00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.500]   know what you're doing, you're going to hurt the people behind you, or you're all confused
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.260]   and you're going to get into a fight like, no, this is next, no, that's next, and then
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.580]   you start pointing the finger at each other.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:15.060]   All around bad scenario when we don't know what's coming up next.
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:20.980]   So, if you're not prepared to do anything, can I say it's a fair assessment that living
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:26.320]   here it is very difficult to keep thinking about what's next, right?
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.860]   Living here, most likely, we're getting constantly distracted, not knowing, are we supposed to
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:32.860]   see this next?
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.000]   Are we supposed to see that next?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.860]   Because let me ask you this really interesting question.
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:41.820]   I just posed to you and read to you that the retribution of Jesus when he dishes out judgment
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.820]   is next.
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.900]   Is that true?
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.580]   Just challenged you, is that true?
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:54.780]   Is what's next on the table simply Christ is going to return and dish out retribution?
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:13:00.900]   Well, that's really interesting thing to think about, and that's how we get to the next passage.
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:06.420]   Please go over to chapter two, 2 Thessalonians 2, verse one through two, I'm sorry, one through
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.420]   three.
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:12.620]   Again, original thought, thinking through all this stuff, what's next?
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.220]   And am I thinking about what's next?
[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.780]   Am I aware of what's next and what's going to be happening?
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:24.380]   Verse one through three of chapter two, sorry, I'm going to say 2 Thessalonians chapter two,
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.380]   verse one through three.
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:29.420]   He says, "Now we request of you, brethren, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:35.180]   Christ and our gathering together to him, that you not be quickly shaken from your composure
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:41.420]   or be disturbed either by a spirit or a message or a letter as if from us, to the effect that
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.260]   the day of the Lord has come.
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:50.140]   That no one in any way deceive you, for it will not come unless apostasy comes first
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:54.620]   and the man of lawlessness is revealed and the son of destruction."
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.420]   Okay.
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.340]   Take a moment to think about that for a moment.
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:04.940]   I asked you, is what's next Jesus is coming and he's going to dish out retribution?
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:09.340]   And then it kind of makes it sound like maybe not.
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.380]   Now I want to give you just a forewarning.
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:18.540]   Today we are not going to sit here and delineate every single dot on the timetable of God.
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.540]   Why?
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.580]   Because we don't know.
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.220]   There are certain things we do know generally.
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.980]   There are certain things that's good and proper for us to work through.
[00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.820]   Is there a tribulation to come?
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.700]   Is there a millennium to come?
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.620]   Is there a future judgment, the behemoth judgment?
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.260]   Is it going to happen?
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.580]   All those things are good and godly to think through because it's in the Bible.
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.300]   However, that's not my purpose in going through this passage today.
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.940]   My purpose is I'm asking you to think.
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:51.780]   The scripture challenges every single one of us to know and be aware of the signs of
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.820]   the times.
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:58.540]   The scripture is telling us you need to be alert, not only alert but ready.
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.740]   You need to be ready to make that turn.
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.220]   But a lot of times we're like, "Wait, what?
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.220]   Here now?
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.220]   This one?"
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.220]   Okay.
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.620]   But it's a different kind of point more so, right?
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:13.220]   And that's what I'm talking about here is these people were in some ways tempted to
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:20.020]   be disturbed, tempted to be deceived, tempted to be shocked, and back in Philippians, alarmed.
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.260]   What in the world is going on?
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.060]   Is this right?
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.980]   And that's the contrast.
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.820]   If we're not understanding what's coming up, then we will be in a situation of, "This doesn't
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:31.820]   seem right.
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.100]   Am I doing the right thing?"
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.460]   And then there's doubt that comes.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.620]   There is a pumping of the brakes.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.260]   All of a sudden, you're not really sure what you should say.
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:47.500]   And then sometimes if it's really bad, then you'll start being like, "What are you doing?"
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.540]   And we don't want to do that.
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:54.020]   We want to listen carefully and learn what does God want us to know.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:59.220]   Now I told you that this was my devotion and I went through a lot of weird feelings about
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.980]   this.
[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:05.900]   Because I started to then ask myself the question, "Am I shocked in certain ways?
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.100]   Have I lost composure, confused, alarmed?"
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:15.140]   And the thing about it is, if you look closely, take a look again at verse 2.
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:20.300]   And he explains why these people, the Thessalonians, were particularly confused.
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.300]   This would be very confusing.
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:26.940]   He says, "Don't be quickly shaken from your composure and do not be disturbed either by
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:31.780]   a spirit or message or letter, as if from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:32.780]   has come."
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.600]   You see that?
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.900]   So what happened there?
[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.460]   Basically, what happened was either by someone saying, "Oh, I think this letter is from Paul,"
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:46.340]   or, "I think I heard Paul say," or whatever it may be, they were being challenged with
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.140]   this thought, "Jesus already came."
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.140]   Okay?
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:54.780]   Now, here and now, I have never had someone knock on my door, say, "Pastor Mark, I need
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:55.780]   to talk to you."
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:56.780]   It's like, "Why?"
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:57.780]   "Oh my gosh."
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:58.780]   It's like, "What's going on?
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.780]   Jesus already came."
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.220]   You know, like, no one has ever come and asked me, "Is this real?
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.220]   Did that happen?"
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:08.460]   No one, I don't think now, people don't really wrestle with that.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:14.900]   However, think about how, again, we're not cognizant of the Lord's return.
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:20.580]   What was prominent in their time was that people would over-spiritualize the return
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:21.580]   of Jesus.
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:26.020]   As a matter of fact, people would over-spiritualize even Jesus' first coming.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:30.740]   And what they would make of it is there's this general spirit of Jesus and a general
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.780]   special knowledge of Jesus that's around you and it's in you, and you don't need to worry
[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.580]   about the physical stuff.
[00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.580]   You guys know what I'm talking about, right?
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:38.900]   You guys have probably heard that before.
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.660]   A ton of teaching like that before.
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.340]   But what does that do to the future coming?
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:47.740]   It almost makes the literal coming of Jesus unnecessary.
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.460]   It almost makes the literal return of Christ unwanted.
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.180]   Why?
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.980]   Because you're just generally living your spiritual thing now.
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.860]   Could we be in danger of that kind of deception?
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:00.980]   Yes.
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:06.660]   But what's more likely is that some people actually believe Jesus physically returned
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.380]   because they were going through intense persecution.
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.080]   We read that, right?
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.380]   Much persecution.
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.140]   All kinds of persecution.
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.140]   Much affliction.
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.140]   Well, Apostle Paul was teaching them.
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:25.820]   Apostle Paul is teaching them that what is to be surrounding Jesus' next return is what?
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.300]   Intense persecution.
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.740]   So now I want us to think about this.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:35.740]   And we're going to walk down the next portion of the passage, chapter 2, verse 4 through
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.780]   12.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.860]   So we're still at 2 Thessalonians 2, verse 4 through 12.
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:46.780]   And he says, this man of lawlessness, "Who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:51.100]   God or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, displaying
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.980]   himself as God.
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.380]   Do you not remember while I was still with you, I was telling you these things?
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.500]   And you know what restrains him now, so that in his time he will be revealed.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.500]   For the mystery of lawlessness is what?
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.660]   Already at work.
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.980]   Only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:14.020]   Then that lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will slay with the breath of his
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:17.980]   mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of his coming.
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:22.820]   That is the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of Satan, with all power
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:27.860]   and signs and false wonders, and with all deception of wickedness for those who perish
[00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:33.060]   because they do not receive the love of truth, so as to be saved.
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:37.220]   For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence, so that they will believe
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:43.100]   what is false, in order that they all may be judged, who did not believe the truth,
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.980]   but took pleasure in wickedness.
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.980]   Wow.
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:54.300]   I say wow because that's honestly really disturbing if you take a moment to think about it.
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:20:00.260]   Can I take a moment to confess to you that when I was doing my devotions, my silly mind
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:06.900]   went to the theological, the doctrinal, the "wait a minute, I believe in pre-tribulation
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.180]   rapture."
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:12.260]   If you guys don't know what I'm referring to there, we're talking about this promise,
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:17.580]   if you guys remember 1 Corinthians 15, "and the twinkle of an eye will all be changed."
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:24.620]   1 Thessalonians chapter 4, you guys are fretting because your brothers have died before you?
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:25.780]   Do not fret, why?
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.580]   Because Jesus is going to come, we're going to be caught up with him, right?
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.500]   I believe that's going to happen before the great tribulation time.
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:37.620]   Tribulation meaning the great time of testing and the wrath of God prophesied in Daniel.
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:43.820]   Okay, all I'm saying is, I did that while I was doing my devotions and I got lost.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.340]   I was starting to think like, "Wait a minute, what is this?"
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.980]   And I started thinking timeline, I started thinking like, "How does this fit with the
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:54.300]   whole systematic theology?"
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.820]   That's not bad, it's not wrong.
[00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.500]   It's in the Bible, you should think about it.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:07.860]   But if you understood, and if I understood, sorry, that this is a huge chunk, a huge chunk
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.360]   of Scripture.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:13.500]   Chapter 1 and 2 together talking about how Christ is going to return.
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:18.460]   Talking about how people are going to be deluded, deceptive, they'll not love the truth, rather
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:25.100]   hate it, and then they're going to be judged by God for their unbelief.
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:30.660]   God is not going to simply come to judge those horrible, heinous people, the murderers, and
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:36.020]   the wicked rapists, and the traffickers, and they're going to be judged.
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:41.780]   God is going to judge every single individual who does not place faith in Christ, who did
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:46.580]   not heed the command, "This is my beloved Son who I'm well pleased, listen to Him."
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:53.820]   Any individual who said, "No," they will be judged ultimately, fiercely.
[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:58.940]   And then I started to realize, and before that comes, there's going to be droves of
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.380]   it.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:05.740]   There's going to be masses of people who are going to, there's going to be an apostasy,
[00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.700]   meaning they're going to look like Christians, they're going to play the game well, and they're
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.700]   going to fall away.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.300]   Why am I sitting here thinking, "Is this preacher?"
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:18.300]   I should be broken for the people.
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:23.740]   I mean I started thinking, "How would I feel if I'm on this pulpit, and half the people
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.860]   in this room was like, 'I don't like the stuff you're saying.
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.260]   We're out,' and then you started leaving.
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.140]   How would I feel, right?
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.140]   I'll be broken."
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:39.580]   What we see coming, which I believe is fast coming, is a time where there's going to be
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:46.060]   incredible, incredible falsehood, hatred of truth.
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.340]   People aren't going to listen to good reason.
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.820]   They're not going to want to hear it.
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.200]   That's what's actually coming.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.540]   Some people think that's only for the, you know, the end, end time.
[00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.860]   Not now, but like the end time.
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:04.660]   Did you catch that he said the lawlessness is working now?
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:10.100]   Did you catch that this mass apostasy, the fake Christians, whatever it was, is organized.
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.580]   There's an individual who's supposed to be later on, he's going to exalt himself, and
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.700]   droves of people are going to worship him.
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.380]   You think that's going to happen overnight?
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:23.180]   See, what I'm focusing on is not just so much like what's the details of how this is going
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:28.260]   to happen, but the fact that the general temperature of spirituality is going to be no love, no
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:33.340]   truth, and a self-righteousness that's against God.
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:36.020]   And that breaks my heart to see.
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.840]   If I'm sober, I should be broken.
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.140]   And that's why I wanted to share with you.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.560]   Do you understand what's next?
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.320]   Please turn your Bible to 1 Timothy chapter 4, verse 1 through 5.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.220]   Here is another Bible passage for us.
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:58.580]   Talking about, again, massive fruitlessness, massive frustrations, massive falsehood.
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:02.380]   These are some, if you're thinking about driving, I'm going to keep using the driving analogy,
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.020]   I mean, these are like warning signs of what's to come, you guys.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:10.100]   It's like, "Road may flood, rocks may slide, you may fall off and die."
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:14.540]   I mean, these are the kind of signs that we're seeing in terms of the Bible passages.
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.660]   Again, 1 Timothy 4, verses 1 through 5.
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:24.820]   But the Spirit explicitly says that in latter times, some will fall away from the faith
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:30.020]   paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons by means of hypocrisy
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:35.300]   of liars seared in their own consciences as with a branding iron.
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:43.140]   Man, if you guys have ever talked to somebody who's so thick, so stubborn, so unyielding,
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:48.460]   hearing this passage, it talks about many people who seem even far worse.
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.460]   They're like seared.
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:54.740]   Okay, verse 3, "Men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God has
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:59.580]   created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth."
[00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:05.260]   Turn again to another passage, 2 Timothy chapter 3, verse 1 through 9.
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.380]   Okay, here's another passage.
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:11.340]   2 Timothy chapter 3, verses 1 through 9.
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.260]   Again, I know we're jumping from verse to verse.
[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.620]   Oh, awesome.
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.620]   Thank you, Sound Tech.
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.260]   You guys are doing a great job.
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:23.260]   You guys can also follow along in your Bibles.
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:29.580]   Here it says, "Realize this, that in the last days, difficult times will come.
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:34.740]   For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:41.460]   to parents, ungrateful, unholy, unloving, irreconcilable, malicious, gossips, without
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:47.780]   self-control, brutal, haters of good, treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:53.220]   than lovers of God, holding a form of godliness, although they have denied its power, avoid
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.780]   such men as these.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:26:00.060]   For among them are those who enter into households and captivate weak women weighed down with
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:06.020]   sins led on by various impulses, always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.020]   truth."
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.020]   Wow.
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:12.100]   Do you know why that's shocking?
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:17.380]   Because all those descriptions describe somebody who folds to a form of religion.
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:22.620]   All of those descriptions describe an individual who perhaps attend church every Sunday.
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.940]   Doesn't that disturb you?
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:26.940]   It should.
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.740]   Doesn't that also break your heart?
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:30.740]   It should.
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:41.380]   There is, before the end time is coming, there is a season where the fullness of sin, the
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:46.380]   stubbornness of man, it's going to prove itself.
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:50.380]   It's literally going to reveal itself as, "Look how dead we are."
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.140]   God has already described the state of mankind.
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:56.380]   You are so dead in your trespasses, you have no life in you.
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:01.900]   I can probe you with a cattle prod, electrocute you maybe, and you still won't respond.
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:02.900]   Why?
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.780]   Because you're dead.
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:10.260]   And over the course of time, mankind is going to reveal itself like that.
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.420]   That's what the scripture is saying.
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:13.420]   And that's heartbreaking.
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:19.700]   And I confess to you, when I read this, I thought of it more of a theological concept.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:24.380]   But if you think about it, this is the generation that's to come.
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:29.500]   Now I want to confess another thing.
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:36.900]   So again, trying to be an open book about my own time and my devotion.
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:41.260]   The passage, one of the reasons why I was describing this to us, because it's commanding
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:45.060]   us, "Don't be alarmed.
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.460]   Don't be so surprised."
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.620]   And I started to reflect, "Am I alarmed?
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:51.620]   Am I surprised?"
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.780]   And I'm going to confess, yes.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:28:00.180]   One of my bad reactions to listening to this, one of my bad reactions to seeing this also
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.820]   in real life, you know what it is?
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.060]   It's incredible frustration.
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.340]   What?
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.100]   And they call themselves Christian?
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.180]   How dare you?
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:12.180]   And the frustrations.
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.580]   Have you guys ever tried to help somebody who doesn't want your help?
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.860]   Gives you the stiff arm?
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.860]   Not only gives you the stiff arm, but tells you like, "You're unloving, you're judgmental,
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.900]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.700]   If you've ever received that, you know how discouraging that is.
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.540]   What's more, the frustration mounts up inside you.
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:29.540]   Why won't you listen?
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.780]   Listen, look, what you're doing is A, what you're doing is B, put it together and it's
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:34.780]   sin.
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:35.780]   Right?
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:39.340]   Like you try to show people, it doesn't work.
[00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.340]   And then what happens?
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.940]   You get so frustrated and you start saying some, "I don't get it.
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.100]   What's the problem?
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.840]   What's wrong?"
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.460]   And then, you know, have you guys ever debated people on politics?
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:55.580]   Oh man, the intensity of frustration just starts to peak.
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.940]   People start to just mock each other like, "I don't understand what's wrong with these
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:28:59.940]   people."
[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.740]   And then they start to really bag on them.
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.540]   They're just stupid and da, da, da, da, da, right?
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:05.540]   We start doing that.
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:09.800]   You get into these debates, people start doing that kind of stuff.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.940]   And then I started realizing, "Mark, what are you doing?
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.900]   Why are you responding to sin this way?
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:21.860]   Why are you responding to hardness of heart this way?
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:25.460]   Are you surprised?"
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.860]   And then it kind of revealed in my heart.
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.140]   And then so now I want to confess another part to you.
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.500]   Oh man, open confession.
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:39.380]   I realized part of me, even as a pastor, I think like, it makes sense, right?
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:43.820]   We teach the Bible, people cry, and we have a great time of fellowship.
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:47.060]   It's supposed to work like that.
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.060]   I'm just being honest.
[00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.820]   Like I had a very simplistic, you have a bunch of people who are not growing, you get them
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:54.260]   in a room, teach them the Bible and they grow.
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:56.580]   That's the way it's supposed to work.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.680]   And then broaden that out, my life.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:05.820]   I'm a young man trying to walk this life, raising my family, being involved in the church.
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:11.060]   I'm supposed to, Scripture says, "Try to live a quiet life, work hard with your hands, and
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.940]   as much as it depends on you, be at peace with everyone."
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:14.940]   You know that's in the Bible, right?
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.260]   Romans 12, I think it's verse 8.
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.260]   So yeah, that's what I'm going to try and do.
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:22.700]   And as I do that, I'm going to watch my kids grow, I'm going to go off to college, I'm
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:27.100]   going to leave them a nice little legacy of this and that, and then we're going to work,
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:31.500]   labor in the church, it's going to be awesome.
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.020]   But here's the problem.
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:38.140]   That's my picture, right?
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:43.500]   And all of a sudden, when persecution comes, people don't listen, you know, my own kids
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.140]   don't listen sometimes, right?
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:48.780]   And all these things don't go right, all of a sudden, like, "What's going on?"
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.900]   All of a sudden, I'm alarmed.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:57.060]   Brothers and sisters, I'm trying to challenge you by showing you my progress through this.
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.900]   I was over here when I was reading.
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:04.740]   My heart had this high anticipation, "Your future is bright.
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:07.140]   The future of our church is bright.
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.140]   Everything is bright."
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:09.140]   I was just an optimistic.
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:15.140]   And then I read the Scripture, and it's like, "No, there are hard times ahead, and there's
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.380]   going to be a mass drove of people who are going to leave the church.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.740]   Does that not break your heart?"
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.580]   And I repented, "God, that breaks my heart."
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.260]   Okay?
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.820]   But did you accept this?
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.660]   Do you understand and accept this truth?
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:31.660]   And then it intensifies.
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.660]   What do I mean by it intensifies?
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:38.500]   Take a look at this.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.460]   Turn your Bibles to Mark chapter 13.
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:44.820]   It intensifies because if I was over here optimistically thinking everything is going
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.900]   to be great, I just teach the Bible, everybody turns.
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.940]   And then the Bible tells you, "No.
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.580]   Remember the words of our Lord."
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:55.860]   Mark chapter 13.
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:01.380]   He says, and I hear some papers, so I'm going to give you a couple minutes to get over there.
[00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:08.020]   Remember, I'm talking about your perspective of you having a clear picture of like, "This
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:11.980]   is what's next, you guys, and I'm going to tell you why it's necessary."
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.620]   This is what's next, you guys, and why it's necessary that you think that.
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:16.620]   Verse four.
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:20.860]   "The disciples say, 'Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.760]   all these things are going to be fulfilled?'
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:28.180]   And Jesus began to say to them, 'See to it that no one misleads you.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:31.100]   Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he.'"
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.300]   Okay, I want you to just ignore that.
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:37.980]   Many will come in my name and say, "I am he," and will mislead many.
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.120]   "When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be frightened.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.380]   Those things must take place.
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:47.580]   But that is not yet the end, for nation will rise up against nation and kingdom against
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.580]   kingdom.
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:50.380]   There will be earthquakes in various places.
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.540]   There will also be famines."
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:55.540]   So here it's talking about the natural disasters, right?
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.860]   Here it's talking about wars, rumors of wars.
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:03.260]   I mean, I'm not going to be one of those people that's like, "Oh my gosh, you guys, it's going
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:06.440]   to happen now," because we had earthquakes, right?
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.440]   We did.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.180]   We had some earthquakes and it scared us.
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:14.180]   Now the fact of the matter is, all of these things are still things that cause good and
[00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.540]   godly Christians to still be like, "What is going on?"
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.540]   I remember when there was disaster happening and many people died.
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.180]   People started wondering, "What's going on?
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:23.180]   What gives?
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.180]   Isn't God sovereign?
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.180]   Isn't he in control?
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.180]   Doesn't he see?
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.280]   Doesn't he watch?"
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.820]   People are confused.
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.240]   Let me continue on.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:34.780]   He describes and says, "These things are merely the beginning of birth pains.
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.460]   But be on your guard, for they will deliver you to the courts.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:42.040]   You will be flogged in the synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.620]   for my sake as a testimony to them.
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:48.020]   The gospel must first be preached to all the nations.
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:52.860]   When they arrest you and hand you over, do not worry beforehand what you are to say,
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:56.700]   but say whatever is given to you at the hour, for it is not you who speak, but it is the
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.140]   Holy Spirit.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:03.060]   Brother will betray brother to death, and father his child, and children will rise up
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:06.260]   against parents and have them be put to death.
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.900]   You will be hated by all because of my name.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:15.060]   But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved."
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.060]   I was here.
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:20.860]   I'm going to live a godly life, preach the Bible, and everything's going to be peachy.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.660]   No, it's not.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:26.380]   And then he says, "It's going to get to a degree, Mark.
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:30.460]   Maybe you might not see it, but the generations next to you will see it.
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.460]   People will hate you.
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:35.540]   They'll hate your guts to the degree they'll want to kill you, throw you in prison."
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.860]   Huh?
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:43.580]   But I live in Lake Forest, and I live near Irvine.
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.860]   Now, you guys have heard that phrase, right?
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:46.860]   Orange County Christianity.
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.980]   And there was times I was like, "What do you mean by all that?
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.680]   You know, Orange County Christianity.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.900]   Just because we have peace and safety?
[00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:56.340]   That's not sinful.
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.860]   We should all thank God for it.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:58.860]   Lord, thank you."
[00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:02.420]   Because if I sit here and you're like, "Don't you dare live in a nice house!"
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.380]   No, that's false too.
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.380]   Praise the Lord.
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.260]   Praise the Lord that you're living where you're living.
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.940]   You have, you know, you have what you have.
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:10.940]   Honour God with it.
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:15.540]   But why is it that Orange County Christianity is so dangerous?
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:22.140]   Is because once you believe this is normative, then everything outside of that is alarming
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.660]   to you.
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.220]   Right?
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:30.180]   Is any part of this picture a potential reality for you?
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:33.340]   Could it even be the case in your life?
[00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:36.020]   Could you even imagine your life going down that way?
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:42.260]   Or have you tried to keep the normative so strongly, you've tried every measure to make
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.820]   sure none of those threats are true?
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.260]   Right?
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:49.300]   That's the danger of Orange County Christianity.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:58.580]   But now, I want to then bring to you guys some points here of challenge and heart.
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:03.980]   Why is it necessary that you and I accept this as what's coming next?
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:08.620]   Why is it necessary that we see this, what could be a very depressing, very dire, very
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:13.860]   sad state of affairs, where there's going to be hardship, persecution, suffering, and
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:15.300]   mass apostasy?
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:19.860]   Why is it necessary for us to think this?
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:27.420]   Because practically speaking, when you see the dire need, that's when you're going to
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.580]   actually preach.
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:32.300]   That's when you're going to have clarity.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.860]   For example, I know people have already talked about it.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.460]   I know you might have already thought about it to some degree.
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:43.300]   Currently speaking, there are friends that I have who are on the fence.
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.060]   "Oh, I don't really know.
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.860]   I don't really know if I believe."
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:50.820]   And there's been this trend, it's something noble, like, "I got to really deconstruct
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:55.740]   what I believe, my traditional beliefs, and I got to make sure," essentially they're doubting.
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:58.340]   "I don't know if this is all true.
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:02.060]   Just culturally, I was in a conservative church, and I happen to believe this."
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:07.460]   And again, because of current affairs, there are famous musicians and artists who are denouncing
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.460]   their faith.
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.740]   There are famous pastors who are denouncing their faith.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.660]   And then there's Christian community who are looking at it thinking, "Ah, you know what?
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.300]   You got to just kind of give them time."
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:18.700]   No.
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:22.820]   You got to convince me that this end isn't coming.
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.940]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:29.620]   We just literally read there's going to be mass hardship leading up to a fullness of
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:35.580]   sin so that when God judges, He is righteous and revealed to be glorified to judge sin
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:38.500]   because it's so sinful.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:42.340]   And He's going to dish out retribution.
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:45.180]   If I'm going to sit there and be like, "Yeah, you know, I guess I got to give these people
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.580]   time, give these people some space.
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.580]   I don't know what to say to them."
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:53.460]   Then you got to convince me that that's not happening.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.780]   But it is.
[00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:03.940]   And that's why I feel the urgency to make sure whoever I talk to, "Do you know Jesus?"
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:05.780]   Right?
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:08.100]   Sometimes a youth group student, when I was in youth group, the new youth group student
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.780]   come in and immediately I'd ask them like, "So who brought you to church?
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.860]   Did you ever have a moment of repentance?"
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:14.860]   And they're like, "Whoa."
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:16.140]   And I tell them, "I know.
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:17.140]   It's awkward.
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.900]   I know I'm getting really up in your face really fast.
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.700]   I get it.
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.500]   It's worth it.
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.820]   This conversation is worth it."
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:29.380]   Some of us are so afraid of making things awkward, so afraid of like, "I don't have
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:30.540]   a good transition."
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:33.300]   So afraid of being up in their faces about it.
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:40.220]   The only thing you have to know is, is this conversation worth it because of what's happening?
[00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:44.140]   And that answer to us should be, "I see it.
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.100]   I've got to talk about it.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:48.700]   Are we in the clear with God?"
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:54.540]   See if we don't know what's coming and we don't know what's before us, how are you even
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:55.540]   going to say anything?
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:59.500]   You're just going to throw up your hands and say, "I don't know."
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:03.300]   Now what's more, understand this.
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:10.020]   I felt like I was, you know, or God was pastoring me and thinking, "Mark, you have a lot of
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:14.700]   assumptions in your mind and worldview that needs to change.
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.420]   You really thought like, you know, you're just projecting out your life and your planning
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:19.980]   and all this kind of stuff.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:20.980]   Great.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.020]   If the Lord wills, fine."
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:31.420]   But the reality is that the vast majority of what's to come is really, really sad.
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:35.260]   And then the reality is, when you say really, really sad, we're talking about things like
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:40.540]   father and son being against each other, mother and daughter being against each other.
[00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:43.900]   This is the spiritual reality that Bible has already predicted.
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:44.900]   Yes?
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:50.700]   And therefore, because it's so intense, you are going to need that much more courage and
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:55.300]   strength and clarity to speak in this scenario.
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.300]   Why?
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:01.940]   Because what God is saying is clearly from now till the end, we are not going to be hitting
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:07.180]   this amazing ministry where people in droves are going to listen to you.
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:11.740]   You, like, I'm pretty confident I can say this to you, the vast majority of you, if
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:16.500]   I were to give like a fair assessment, you know, 10 out of 10 times, how many times was
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.140]   your evangelism successful?
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:21.420]   You're going to have a fruitless ministry.
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:22.420]   Right?
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.940]   Is that like too harsh for me to say?
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.260]   Am I being super pessimistic?
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:28.340]   No, I'm not.
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:31.260]   God has already told us.
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.340]   Wide is the road.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.180]   Narrow is the road to life.
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.180]   What's more?
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:40.500]   The scriptures of scripture, Apostle Paul warned us that a time will come, people will
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.900]   not endure sound doctrine.
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.580]   They're going to want to have their ears tickled.
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:49.120]   They'll accumulate people, teachers in accordance to their own desires, and they will turn away
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.900]   their ears from the truth and will turn to myths.
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.100]   They will say, "I know that's true.
[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:58.940]   I know that's a whole lot of fancy wishful thinking, but I love it."
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.940]   That's what's going to happen.
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.180]   Why do I say this, guys?
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:12.260]   It's because I realize like, man, if I base my ministry, not just as a pastor, but even
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:17.620]   as a brother counseling another brother, if I base what I'm going to say on how people
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:21.020]   respond to me, I'm lost.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:22.460]   What am I saying?
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:26.300]   The ministry that we have in the gospel and preaching the gospel of Christ, we have to
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:27.500]   be so convinced.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.300]   I already know the road ahead is going to be super hard.
[00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.580]   As a matter of fact, probably nine out of ten times, I'm going to get the door in my
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:38.340]   face, but yet I will preach.
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:39.580]   And we're going to need that.
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:40.580]   Why?
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:42.340]   Because that's the reality.
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:48.020]   I remember this one time, I was out and then this other pastor, we were talking pastor
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:51.040]   stuff and he was like, "You know, we should partner together.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.520]   My goal is to reach a million people for Jesus.
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.700]   Let's team up and do it."
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:57.700]   And I sat there.
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:58.700]   I didn't know what to say to him.
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:03.500]   I was like, "Something about that is like, ah."
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.540]   I wish I was reading in this passage.
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.140]   Are you going to force that?
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:14.380]   Listen, our ministry is not going to be because all of a sudden droves of people are listening
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.900]   to me and everybody's like, "Yes, give me more."
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.300]   Why?
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:22.020]   Reality is the majority are going to reject.
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:26.180]   Please turn your Bibles to Isaiah chapter 6, verse 8 through 13, and this has been the
[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.380]   case.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:32.380]   What I just described to you now has been the case for generations.
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.020]   For generations.
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.340]   Isaiah sees an amazing vision.
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:41.340]   Again, this is Isaiah chapter 6, verse 8 through 13.
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.860]   Isaiah sees an amazing vision of God on the throne.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:48.180]   He's in control, train of His robe, filling the temple.
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:51.880]   There might not be a king on the throne, but there is God on the throne, right?
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.540]   Such an encouraging vision.
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:59.420]   In verse 8, this is what he says, "I heard a voice of the Lord saying, 'Whom shall I
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.580]   send and who will go for us?'
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.380]   And then I said, 'Here I am, send me.'"
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:07.220]   Listen to God's reply.
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:10.020]   God replied, "Go and tell this people.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.500]   Keep on listening, but do not perceive.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.100]   Keep on looking, but do not understand.
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:20.180]   Render the hearts of this people insensitive, their ears dull, their eyes dim.
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:24.740]   Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.220]   hearts, and return and be healed."
[00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:31.700]   What?
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:35.260]   He said, "Here I am, send me to go preach."
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:40.900]   Why in the world would God say, "And tell them you're not going to understand."
[00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.980]   They're going to be dull.
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:48.740]   They're going to see, but they're never going to actually sense.
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.060]   What in the world?
[00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:53.340]   And so look at his reply in verse 11.
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.100]   So then how long?
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:56.740]   Why?
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:03.880]   Because every single one of us, if you and I go out and we preach, if you and I counsel
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:09.420]   and we speak, if you and I try to share and we get the door, we're going to be tempted
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:10.820]   to give up.
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.540]   We will be dismayed.
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:15.460]   And many people in this generation, do you know what they said?
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:17.420]   We're not doing the right thing.
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:18.540]   It's not working.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:21.620]   We can't just put the Bible in their face.
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:23.020]   Even in counseling, I hear this all the time.
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.260]   You can't just throw Bible verses at people.
[00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:29.780]   Yeah, I can't throw it at people, but that's all I've got really.
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:33.100]   All I pretty much have, the power of His Word.
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:37.180]   So in this generation, people are alarmed, people are dismayed, people are like, "Whoa,
[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.540]   shocked that people aren't listening."
[00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:39.540]   So what do they do?
[00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:40.540]   They change their methodology.
[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:41.540]   "Maybe we should try something else."
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:46.580]   Brothers and sisters, that's what I'm talking about.
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:51.740]   If we're going to summarize the sermon today, my whole point is you have to see what's next
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:57.020]   because it requires so much strength.
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:59.980]   It requires that kind of dedication.
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:03.780]   It requires you preemptively already knowing, "I have to be alert.
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.060]   I have to be sober."
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:06.060]   Why?
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:13.460]   Because God has called me to preach in a time where everybody, not everybody, but the mass,
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:17.900]   the masses will reject you until the time of His judgment.
[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:19.920]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:25.020]   And so in some kind of way, I want to conclude my thoughts here.
[00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:30.300]   Man, God has told a long time ago Isaiah that this would be the case.
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.260]   God has told Paul that this would be the case.
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:34.260]   God has told...
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.700]   I mean, He's told all the disciples.
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:40.100]   He warned them, "You're going to go, they're going to threaten you, they're going to judge
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.880]   you."
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.420]   Are you already accepting of that?
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:48.520]   Or did you just somehow wish, "I want to live...
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:53.380]   Over here, I want to live this godly Christian life, peace out with everybody, and I hope
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:56.740]   to just do this thing and go.
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:01.300]   And eventually, by the time I retire, I'm going to have the state of solid Christian,
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:04.220]   served at my church, and I'm good."
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:09.380]   My challenge to you is, bless the Lord if you can do that, but open your hands because
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:12.180]   He might put into your hands something more.
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.180]   Yes?
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:18.060]   Now, as I say this, there was another moment in my devotion where I really felt like God
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:19.060]   was challenging my heart.
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.540]   What do I mean?
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:27.660]   I started thinking like, "God, that's weird, isn't it?
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.660]   You know all these people are going to reject you.
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:33.860]   You know all these people are hardened of heart, like Scripture describes, and a stiff
[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:36.860]   neck, like they won't even move.
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:42.740]   And you've already sent your disciples, and you're going to send us now too?"
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:47.300]   And then the Scripture is pretty much responding like, "Yes, but why?"
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:51.420]   Turn in your Bibles to 2 Thessalonians 3, verse 1-5.
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:57.260]   2 Thessalonians 3, verse 1-5.
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:05.820]   And well, the Scripture says, it's kind of like a weird command plus rationale behind
[00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:09.380]   it that kind of answers quite a lot.
[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:15.620]   He says, "Finally, brethren, pray for us that the word of the Lord will spread rapidly
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:22.500]   and be glorified just as I did also with you, and that we will be rescued from this perverse
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:24.020]   and evil man.
[00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:30.740]   For not all have faith, but the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you from
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.260]   the evil one.
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:36.900]   We have confidence in the Lord concerning you that you are doing and will continue to
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:38.420]   do what we command."
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:39.420]   Now listen to this.
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:42.540]   If you highlight, this is one to highlight, verse 5.
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:48.140]   "May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the steadfastness of
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:50.940]   Christ."
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:54.860]   I think one of the things I realized was I started to have this complaint like, honestly
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:48:01.340]   speaking, why would anybody sign up and say, "Here I am, send me," if all of counseling
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:07.140]   or all of preaching and all of evangelism is going to be met with a wall and people
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:10.540]   who reject you, who would sign up for that?
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.540]   Right?
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:15.380]   That's a fair question to ask.
[00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:19.540]   And as I felt that way, I started to pray and I realized there is a bit of a complaint
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:24.920]   in my heart like, "God, honestly speaking, there are more effective ways that this can
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:25.920]   come out, right?
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:28.260]   There's more fruit to be born."
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:32.500]   And then you realize it's not always about the end fruit.
[00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:33.540]   Why?
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:37.060]   God is going to be glorified either way.
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:41.220]   God's glory is not dependent on the masses coming to Him.
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:47.280]   God is glorified when He was willing to go chase one sheep when the 99 sheep wasn't really
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.780]   paying attention.
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:50.260]   Right?
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:58.220]   Let's say if God went to preach Himself and everybody, everybody rejected Him.
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:48:59.780]   God would still be glorified.
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:00.780]   Why?
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:06.580]   He says, "Even though heaven and earth may pass away, my word stands forever."
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:08.880]   God stands just and true.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:13.460]   And at the end of days, it's going to be that His perfect holiness, justice, and righteousness
[00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:16.140]   will be revealed, but so will His love.
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:19.780]   And His love is shown here in that little statement in verse 5.
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:24.940]   All it said was, "May the Lord direct your hearts into the steadfastness of Christ."
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:33.460]   And I realize, oh my goodness, think about the perseverance of Christ.
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:39.340]   Think about not wanting to sign up for a fruitless ministry.
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:42.540]   Could you dare ever say that to Jesus?
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:44.540]   I don't want to sign up for this ministry.
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:46.660]   People aren't listening.
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:49.900]   Could I pray that to the Lord?
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:53.580]   I don't know because my family is going to think I'm weird.
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:57.340]   Could Jesus not have ridiculed from His own family?
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:01.420]   I don't know because my friendship is going to get all awkward.
[00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:08.220]   What can I possibly say as an excuse for not signing up for the ministry of God, especially
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:11.120]   to the face of my Lord Jesus?
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:17.460]   And I realize part of all this, the vast majority of it is for the glory of God, but then another
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:21.860]   part of it is for me to understand this has been the heart of my Savior.
[00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:25.140]   Let's pray.
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:31.780]   Lord, we want to thank you so much for your grace.
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:40.260]   Lord, Scripture has told us that you are a patient God who has stretched out your hand
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:45.820]   of mercy to an obstinate people all day long.
[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:51.140]   And then to think, God, that even in this generation, when masses of people like fluff
[00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:55.460]   more than your truth, and yet you still give us your word.
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:57.860]   What a grace of mercy that is.
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:04.140]   So Father, we thank you so much, and we pray that we will be alert, we will understand,
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:07.300]   we will know and have the perspective of what's coming.
[00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:12.260]   And God, we would not have our own picture of what our life should be.
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:13.580]   We eagerly wait for you, Lord.
[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:14.820]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:15.260]   Amen.
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:24.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
