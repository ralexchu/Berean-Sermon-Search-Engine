[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   - Hello, everyone.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.920]   This is lesson 22 through our inductive study through the Book of Ephesians.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.760]   That's a lot of weeks and we're still excited to go through our last chapter,
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.760]   chapter 6.
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.440]   We are essentially then on the tail end of the study.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.080]   There are so many practical applications and important truths for us to apply.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.480]   We're praying for a lot of fruitfulness, especially as it relates to our home
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.000]   lives and the relationships that we have.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.280]   Before we jump in, let's pray and ask for the Lord's blessing on our time.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.680]   Lord, we thank you, God, for your grace.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.520]   Father, we pray that all the truths that we learn, we will take the step,
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.840]   the necessary step to examine our private lives through it.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.960]   Especially, Lord, and even the comforts of our own home in the daily experiences and
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.360]   the relationships that we have.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.920]   In those contexts, Lord, help us to live out your truth.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.360]   Particularly, Father God, with the empowerment and strength of your spirit,
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.000]   help us to know what it means to serve the needs of others,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.040]   to submit ourselves to the good of those around us.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.160]   Ultimately, seeking, Father God, that people all around us will come to a
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.000]   saving knowledge of you.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.040]   And we pray, Father God, that by us living in faith, you would magnify yourself.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.280]   Lord, we thank you so much for your truth tonight, and pray, God,
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.320]   that again, you would use it in our lives in a mighty way.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.880]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.320]   Okay.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.880]   Well, let's take a look at chapter 6, verses 1 through 9.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.280]   And I'm reading out of the NASB, and it says here, "Children, obey your parents
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.960]   in the Lord, for this is right.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.640]   Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment,
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.600]   with a promise, so that it may be well with you, and that you may live long
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.760]   on the earth.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.440]   Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.800]   and instruction of the Lord.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.360]   Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh,
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.560]   with fear and trembling, and the sincerity of your heart as to Christ,
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.680]   not by way of eye service as men pleasers, but as slaves of Christ,
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.320]   doing the will of God from the heart.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.280]   With goodwill, render service as to the Lord and not to men,
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.920]   knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.080]   from the Lord, whether slave or free.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.800]   And masters, do the same things to them and give up threatening,
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.840]   knowing that both their master and yours is in heaven, and there is no
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.080]   partiality with him."
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.160]   Okay.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.520]   So, as we take a look at this passage, it does this categorical, you know,
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.600]   places in people's lives, and there's a theme, obviously,
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.240]   within the various commandments that he gives.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.640]   So, if we recall back in chapter 5, verses 20 and through 21,
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.400]   Apostle Paul said, "Always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord,
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.720]   Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father, and to be subject to one another in the
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.720]   fear of Christ."
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.920]   The reason why I included verse 20 is because there is a sentiment that
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.160]   everything you are doing, you're supposed to be doing it with
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.360]   thankfulness in your heart and in the name of the Lord, right?
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.440]   In Christ is the realm in which you are supposed to be living your life.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.960]   And that, he connects it to being subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.520]   So, in you living your life in the context of Christ, there should be an
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.080]   empowerment that now you're able to be subject to one another through your own
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.800]   relationship with Christ.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.760]   And so, as an application of that, we learn, starting from verse 22 of chapter 5,
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.840]   that wives ought to give submission to your husbands, just as you would give
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.520]   submission to Christ.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.240]   And then the husbands, I phrased it this way, you're supposed to be submitting
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.640]   essentially to the example of Christ, just as he gave us that example, okay?
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.440]   He gave us this example to love for the benefit in a sacrificial manner for his
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.120]   church.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.960]   And likewise, then, for the husband is called to submit to that role.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:26.440]   As a head of the home, as a head of the wife, he is to be seeking her good,
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.080]   her spiritual good.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.640]   And then here now, we have then categorical exhortations that that
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.320]   application of the submit to one another should also happen within the relationship
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.880]   between child and father, and then slave and master, okay?
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.960]   So, that's what we're studying tonight.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.760]   And so, the first portion of it, starting from verse 1 through 3, we have here the
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.960]   scripture saying, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord for this is right.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.400]   Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise,
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.760]   so that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth."
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.120]   Okay.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.200]   So, as we take a look at that, the commandments I've highlighted for you
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.320]   there in purple, and it is this idea that we ought to obey the parents and honor the
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.320]   father and mother, right?
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.640]   So, essentially, when we think about children, I mean, it's no like news and
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.800]   something, I guess, novel and brand new to us to say that children should learn how
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.200]   to respect authority, okay?
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.720]   But sometimes, I think that a lot of people expect people to learn that or
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.480]   children to learn that when they play sports, when they get involved in organized
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.280]   activities, or at school.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.160]   But the idea here is they should be learning that initially through their
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.880]   relationship with their parents, right?
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.480]   So, as we think about this, I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time,
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.280]   but we do want to make mention of this fact that there should be in the
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.480]   relationship between child and parent a respect for authority and obedience, okay?
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.160]   Now, one of the things that will be of good question, or at least something of an
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.240]   applicational question, for a lot of people will understand, okay,
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.560]   if you're an underage, right, under 18 years old, then of course,
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.440]   you're supposed to obey your parents.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.360]   But I think for a lot of people, the question comes down to what about when
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.920]   you're an adult, okay?
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.000]   Adult child, are you supposed to be obeying your parents in everything?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.920]   What if you're married and you actually are now the man of your own household?
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.200]   Are you supposed to be obeying your parents?
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.280]   Doesn't the scripture say that husband and wife should leave and cleave?
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.200]   Essentially, for this reason, a man should leave his mother and father.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.720]   And essentially, the line of authority has changed.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.000]   So, all that is true.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.880]   What I'd like to say about that is, notice how it's not just simply that you
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:54.160]   should obey no matter what, without qualification, in everything,
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.800]   through the rest of your life, to your parents.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.840]   But actually, the commandment has to do a lot with also the honor and the respect due
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.560]   to father and mother, okay?
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:11.240]   So, one of the things that I would like to highlight is that within the context of
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:18.640]   child and parent, there should nevertheless be what I like to call the open ear, okay?
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.920]   The open ear.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.000]   Because let's take a moment to acknowledge the fact that since we were children,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.320]   to our parents, we were disobedient.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.640]   And when we are children, a lot of times, what we give them is the closed ear.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:37.600]   What I mean is, when we're little kids, we have to almost be forced to open our ears, right?
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.080]   When our parents call our name, we push the envelope and we try to test the waters
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.200]   on how many times we can ignore them before they get upset.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.960]   When we're teenagers, how many times were we just simply upset,
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.200]   not because they told us to do something horrendous.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.440]   They didn't ask us necessarily to sin.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.040]   They didn't try to harm us, but we just didn't like them telling us what to do.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.440]   Because why?
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.200]   Because we're an adult now, right?
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.000]   Respect me, right?
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.080]   We just don't like people telling us what to do.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.960]   And what's really interesting about all this is there's a passage I would like to read for you
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.120]   in 2 Corinthians 3, verses 1 through 6.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.760]   Okay, 2 Corinthians 3, verses 1 through 6.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.880]   I don't have this on the PowerPoint, but you can take a moment to look at that.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.800]   And it says, "Understand this, that in the last day, there will come times of difficulty.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.000]   For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.320]   disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, heartless, unappeasable,
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:45.120]   slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, treacherous, reckless,
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.000]   swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.560]   having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.000]   Avoid such people."
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.240]   Okay.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:01.760]   When you think about this, the general sentiment and tide of the day is going to be an absolute
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.760]   callous and closed heart.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.720]   They'll be so set in their own way, in their own arrogance, and so stubborn,
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.760]   they're not going to open their ears.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:18.080]   And so, in that kind of discussion, I want to say, for us, the contrary,
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.520]   or at least in Christ, how we would look different is that, yes,
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.720]   even if, let's say, you grew up with pretty horrible parents.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.560]   Let's say your parents aren't godly, like their character isn't respectable.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.440]   But nevertheless, would you still give them an open ear to hear them out,
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.160]   to try your best to at least learn?
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.960]   Let's say they give you nothing but earthly wisdom.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.800]   Would you still learn that earthly wisdom from them?
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.640]   Or would you just say, "I'm the man now, I'm older, and you need to listen to me."
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.760]   Because I don't think we necessarily need to win that battle.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.000]   Now, clearly, there are parameters.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.920]   Clearly, there are exceptions to when you wouldn't be listening to your parents,
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.040]   because that earthly wisdom is completely in contrast,
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.680]   in conflict with biblical wisdom.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.240]   But nevertheless, are you showing them honor and respect, even as an adult?
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.280]   Because that should be the case.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.480]   Here's another important just inductive study kind of question,
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.520]   is notice how it says, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord."
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.560]   And I want to pose to you several questions here.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.240]   What does this "in the Lord" mean?
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.200]   You know, what's really interesting is I was reading kind of commentaries.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.800]   And one commentary tried to just give all the options,
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.920]   like possible options, the way that you can interpret it.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.120]   And I thought that was kind of interesting.
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.440]   So I copied some of those things down here.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.480]   Does the "in the Lord" just mean parameters?
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.720]   Like so long as the instruction is biblical, then you can obey.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.120]   Does it actually more so mean the source of your power?
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.440]   Like obey your parents, because I know it's hard,
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.040]   but do it in the Lord, because He's going to empower you.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.040]   Okay?
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.840]   Or does it simply mean the character of the parents?
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.640]   Like obey your parents who are in the Lord.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.680]   Obey your parents who are a Christian.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.600]   Or does this generally mean the context of your life?
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.040]   That in the power of Christ, in your living for His glory in the Lord,
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.040]   you're obeying your parents.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.520]   And that's the way that I would like to think of it.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.680]   Because the idea is as you live your life in the Lord,
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.480]   a practical ramification of you living your life in the Lord
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.560]   is going to be an ability, a motivation to give respect, honor,
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.440]   and obedience because of the way God has made things.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.560]   Because of your ability to submit and obey Christ,
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.680]   and that kind of obedient heart is in you,
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.640]   and you're living in the power of Christ and for His glory,
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.760]   you're going to be able to do that.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.080]   Okay.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:45.520]   Now, what's really interesting as we keep looking at this portion of the text
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.440]   is that this "in the Lord," obeying your parents in the Lord
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.040]   and honoring your father and mother has a rationale to it.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.720]   Okay.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.520]   For example, I put some brackets for you there.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.200]   It says, "For this is right."
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.360]   And what's more, this commandment is the first with a promise.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:07.800]   Verse three, "So that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth."
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.960]   Okay.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.000]   Now, when you take a look at this passage,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.440]   then the rationales can be summarized into two statements,
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:19.200]   which is essentially number one, the standard of God says this is right.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.720]   It's a standard and expectation of the way God has created things.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.480]   God has created a relationship with Father and Son.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.720]   And I believe everything in this life, the physical world that God has created,
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.560]   He uses to show us the spiritual realities.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:43.840]   This world, those shadows, the examples are either tainted, lacking, and sometimes perverted.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:49.240]   But nevertheless, in its original intent, God has desired that to show His glory
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.480]   and the realities of the spiritual life, which is our relationship with the Father.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.560]   What's more, He talks about how this is for your good.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.600]   So right here, Apostle Paul applies the good inductive study methods,
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.280]   which is to observe, "Hey, did you observe that this is one of the first commandments
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.720]   with a promise to you among the 10 commandments in the list of 10?"
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.040]   Remember how the first section goes up to the Lord and your dealings with God
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.280]   and the second has your dealings horizontally.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.560]   And of the first, it says, "You need to obey your parents
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.160]   because this is going to be well for you."
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.320]   So essentially, this is not only the standard of God, but this is for your own blessing.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.000]   Okay?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.280]   This is to your own blessing.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:32.000]   And this to me, again, points to the gracious, provisional nature of God.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.680]   Like God is ultimate Father who has laid down provisions for His people
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:46.560]   that as children are raised up, they're under the protection of the parents in their realm.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.080]   And as they abide in that, that is to them their blessing.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.800]   And so again, in the original intent of God and how He has structured things,
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.880]   that is to our good.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.720]   And the people who want to say, "You know what, Freak?
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.320]   I don't like people telling me what to do.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.360]   I'm my own man.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.200]   I don't need parents.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.680]   I don't need this."
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:13.000]   I mean, in the end, again, we read 2 Timothy 3 when it started talking about this day and age,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.920]   that kind of radical independence, that kind of arrogant thinking is contrary to the creative order of God.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.040]   Okay?
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.400]   All right.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.920]   So there's a lot for you guys to think through there.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.520]   I didn't answer necessarily everything, but at least we started looking through the command.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:30.840]   Okay?
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.720]   And then we started looking through the parameters or at least in Christ.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.080]   And then we looked at the rationale.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.880]   And what we're going to see is that that pattern repeats itself multiple times throughout this section.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.560]   Next, going to the fathers.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:43.840]   Okay?
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.640]   Going to the fathers.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:54.000]   It says here, to the fathers, "Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.280]   but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord."
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.280]   Okay?
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:05.240]   So here, it particularly speaks to fathers, but obviously, it's not saying like, "You know, moms,
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.960]   just do whatever you want.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.760]   Anger them and then provoke them as much as you want."
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.680]   All parenting includes in this.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:17.600]   And one of the things I just want to mention is I really like the author, Paul Tripp,
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.440]   when it comes to parenting.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.040]   And he has a lot of great books, like multiple books when it comes to that.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:29.160]   Now, here, in our observation of this text, what's really interesting to me is he kind of highlights,
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:34.240]   Apostle Paul highlights, you know, the scriptures highlight here one perhaps tendency that has
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.360]   happened a lot.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.320]   Okay?
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.240]   And so there's a negative command that says, "Do not provoke your children to anger."
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.080]   Okay?
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:47.680]   And so when we look at that, we realize, "Hey, there is a pattern where parents,
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:53.520]   perhaps in their use of the authority that God has vested into them above their children,
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:59.080]   this can also go sour to the irritation, frustration, and anger of the children."
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:15:59.840]   Okay?
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.480]   And so we'd have to start kind of thinking, "What are some of the things,
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.960]   what are some of our habits that anger children?
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.680]   What are some of those things that we're doing?
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.280]   What are ways that parents really set people off?"
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.480]   And you could even just kind of imagine your own upbringing, you know?
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.800]   Again, not to like dig up old wounds, but you can just start thinking about your own past,
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.880]   like, "Huh, what were things that caused anger?"
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.840]   And the reason why, even if you're single, even if you don't have kids yet,
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.800]   all that kind of stuff, you should be thinking about this is because you realize that when you
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:37.800]   are placed in a scenario where you now have vested authority and you have a lot of authority,
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:43.640]   I mean, think about how much authority is vested and entrusted to the parent by God.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.960]   It's a lot.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:51.600]   The whole realm of care, instruction, raising up and discipling,
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.040]   it's in the authority and responsibility of the parent.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:00.520]   And so as you think about that, we as sinners, when we are given that amount of authority,
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.160]   we have a tendency to go astray with it.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.920]   We have a tendency to pervert it.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:11.040]   So when I think about it, some of the top things that come to mind typically is that the mom is
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:15.160]   absolutely over-controlling and that the dad is absent.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:20.280]   This has been kind of like the tendency throughout history, right?
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:25.200]   The father is at work, a bit absent and out of the lives of the children.
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.920]   The mother, in her desire to nurture and care, now all of a sudden becomes smothering,
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:36.520]   over-controlling, has incredible unrealistic expectations for the children.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:41.560]   And so as a challenge to every single one of us, I mean, to which tendency do you let?
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.640]   When you're given a certain authority, do you smother?
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.320]   Do you become overly restrictive?
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.080]   Don't do this, don't do that.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.000]   I mean, you think about sometimes, you know, these terminologies like tiger moms and
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.800]   helicopter moms and da-da-da-da-da, right?
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:00.200]   These stereotypes exist because these are common experiences that a lot of people can
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.440]   attest to.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.000]   But the fact of the matter is we all can do this.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.120]   I mean, the other day I was just laughing at myself because I was like telling my sons
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.240]   like eat this, eat that, like something fell off their plate, just eat it.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:19.360]   And then, I mean, I just kind of stopped myself because am I going to be that guy, that parent
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:25.280]   that has to point to what you specifically eat on your plate in that moment?
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.480]   I mean, I just kind of stopped myself.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.400]   And sometimes, yeah, that could be necessary, but I have to at least kind of like check
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.400]   myself, right?
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.480]   But on the other flip side, do I have a temptation to be non-involved because I'm tired, because
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.520]   I have enough to care for on my own, because we're busy?
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:48.920]   Because sometimes trying to engage another person and try to like pull conversation out
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.160]   of them is even harder mental work than just going and mowing the lawn or something like
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.160]   that, right?
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.760]   Do we have the temptation to neglect important people in our lives?
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.960]   And the answer is absolutely yes.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.960]   But there's more.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:06.480]   And again, I'm not going to spend a crazy amount of time, but there are a lot of things
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.480]   that we can do.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:13.360]   Through the Bible, there are things that are shown to us.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.840]   People have always used manipulation strategies to get what they want.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.840]   Sometimes parents do it.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.840]   Threats.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.720]   I'm about to get angry.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.120]   Don't make Appa angry, right?
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.920]   Sometimes we say, "You know what you always do?
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.160]   You always push my buttons, right?
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.360]   You can do immature things to our children sometimes.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.640]   Sometimes we use strange consequences and reward systems.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:41.040]   Parents, please do not bargain with your children, right?
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:47.120]   You need to set a kind of like, "This is what the Lord expects from you.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.120]   God has placed me as responsible over you."
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.480]   Those are things that you need to communicate.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:57.440]   Scripture has shown us that playing favorites is the worst, whether it be Jacob and Esau,
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.680]   whether it be this person and that person with King David.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.520]   You have a lot of different things.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.520]   Sometimes what frustrates children the most is that kind of comparing of one child to
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.360]   another.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:18.440]   Parents who play this favoritism generally lead the children to fight, compete, and it
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.320]   just exacerbates the situation.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.240]   Do we abuse the authority that we've been given?
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.480]   Again, I don't want to necessarily spend too much time on that, but you guys don't know
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:34.200]   what I'm talking about is when we sometimes have that responsibility, we can end up doing
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:39.560]   all sorts of things to try to exercise authority.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.600]   Sometimes rather than actually exercising the authority that God has given us, we turn
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:48.880]   to human wisdom and the challenge for us to make sure that we don't do the opposite of
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.160]   what we're trying to do, which is essentially just enrage somebody rather than following
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.160]   us.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:59.920]   The positive portion of this, Scripture says, is that we need to be bringing them up in
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.400]   the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.200]   Here's a passage from 2 Timothy 3:10-17.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:12.520]   Now just by way of context, remember 2 Timothy 3:1 started off by saying, "In the latter's
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.720]   days it's going to be horrible.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:21.160]   We're going to find all kinds of rebellion, disobedience, thanklessness, hard hearts, arrogance,
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.760]   and all kinds of vile things.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.760]   What are we going to do?"
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.400]   You know sometimes when I talk to other parents, it's like, "Oh my goodness, I feel sorry for
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.560]   the next generation.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:34.360]   I am so worried and so concerned for the next generation.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.240]   What kind of world are our children going to grow up in?"
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:44.080]   In one sense, that is a legitimate concern because Scripture says things will go from
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.760]   bad to worse.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:51.000]   Well here essentially is part answer to that.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.760]   What's interesting is starting from verse 10, Paul says to Timothy, "Now you followed
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:22:01.280]   my teaching, conduct, as example, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance, persecutions,
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:06.520]   and sufferings such as happened to me at Antioch, and Iconium, and at Lystra.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:12.120]   What persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord rescued me.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:17.200]   Indeed, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.760]   But evil men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.360]   You however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.480]   whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.560]   which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.600]   in Christ Jesus.
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.320]   All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.920]   Parents, your job is to teach.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.560]   For reproof, parents, your job is to reprove.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:52.960]   For correction, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be adequate, sorry,
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:57.080]   adequate, equipped for every good work."
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.040]   Think about this passage.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.920]   The Word of God is sufficient for every generation.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:10.720]   God's been for 2,000 years and more, many thousand years, will be for years to come.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:15.800]   For our children, I try to make sure that I'm trying to connect them.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:21.880]   When I want them to correct their behavior, I try to always instill with them, this is
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.200]   what God expects of you.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.800]   I want God to bother their conscience.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.840]   Even if it's they're just fighting for some toy, I don't sit there and say, "What are
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.840]   you doing?"
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.840]   Right?
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.840]   "You're making me mad.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.840]   Just knock it off.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.560]   You're making me mad."
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.560]   Right?
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.680]   I say, "Hey, you think God's proud of you?
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.760]   So you got all the Legos in your bucket.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.600]   You think God's just saying, 'Wow, good job.'"
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:52.520]   No, no, God expects of you to take care of your brother to a degree and to feel what
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:58.040]   it feels like to know that to give is better than to receive.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.640]   You care for your brother so much, you're willing to say, "You know what?
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.640]   I've got this thing.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.880]   Do you want to play with it?"
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:08.720]   This is a small little example, but we need to be regularly impressing upon the children
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:13.640]   the expectations of God and what is pleasing to Him and not pleasing to Him.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.680]   Because we have to bear upon the children the wisdom of God.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.680]   You know what's really interesting?
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:26.320]   This passage, when it tells us that we have to be disciplining and instructing the children,
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:32.840]   the idea for instruction is a word, "nuthesia," where essentially it's the idea of putting
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.460]   into someone's mind.
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.240]   It's a correction of their thinking.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:41.360]   And one of the things that I've heard, which was so helpful to me, is whenever you're trying
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:48.120]   to show someone how to make a decision, you have to show them the wisdom behind that.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.880]   You have to show them how they got to that decision.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:57.200]   And that to me has been really, really valuable in terms of how I'm trying to instruct and
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.920]   guide our children.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.920]   Okay.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.760]   Moving forward.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.440]   Number three.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.280]   To the slaves.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:11.920]   It says here, "Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh,
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.920]   with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart as to Christ, not by way of
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.200]   eye service as men pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.000]   heart.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.320]   With good will, render service as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that whatever good
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:37.880]   things each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free."
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.120]   Now, this is kind of difficult, right?
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:46.600]   Given the current day sentiment, any talk of slavery might be just like, "That was the
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:47.640]   most heinous thing.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.240]   That's an unspeakable topic."
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:55.160]   And this passage perhaps for a lot of people, they might feel like, "Let's pass on this
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.640]   one," right?
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:03.760]   Because essentially it is calling slaves to be more obedient than they are.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.640]   Right?
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:12.560]   It doesn't say, "Put your foot down and rebel."
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.920]   It says, "Be even more obedient from the heart."
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.720]   That's a pretty incredible command.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.560]   And I believe that this is important for us to think through.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:29.120]   How can Apostle Paul write this to slaves?
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.400]   The fact of the matter is, it comes with the authority of God.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.160]   As we think about this, we ask the question, I just highlighted slaves there.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.080]   And yes, when we ask the question, "Who are these slaves?"
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.120]   And is there any kind of corollary today and application to us?
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.200]   There is.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:49.120]   First and foremost, slaves are in fact what we're thinking in terms of people who are
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.160]   deemed as property.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:56.080]   Throughout mankind's history, I mean, think about this.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:01.240]   Early on, even in the book of Genesis, famous characters like Joseph, what was he sold as?
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.200]   A slave.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:11.400]   Slavery existed for so long because there was absolute perversion in the heart of man.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:17.440]   And the crazy part of it is, throughout mankind's history, human beings were sold, traded, and
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:20.520]   sometimes thrown away.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:25.040]   Does this passage condone what we're thinking then of slavery?
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.920]   And the answer is no.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.040]   The answer is no.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:38.320]   See, scripture in the Old Testament has many, many laws related to how to deal with those
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:44.120]   who are outsiders, prisoners of war, slaves and servants.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:48.400]   And what's very incredible is the scriptures, when we think about sometimes the Old Testament,
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.360]   some people think like, "Yeah, the word of God is in the Old Testament is like wrath."
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:57.120]   Actually, the word of God and the laws of God were merciful.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.520]   It included things like years of jubilee.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.760]   It included things like periodic rest.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:06.080]   It included things like when you harvest, consider the lowly.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.120]   And it's particularly for slaves, did you know that in the Old Testament law, Israelites
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.640]   could not sell off one of their own.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.880]   You cannot kidnap somebody.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:21.200]   There were laws that talked about how an individual who is willing to subject themselves to another,
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.880]   let's say someone who's more powerful, there is an essentially kind of like an indentured
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.080]   servanthood.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:31.920]   There are rules for periodic times when you allow slaves to be freed.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.880]   There are rules concerning the marriages of slaves.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:39.120]   There are rules concerning protection and asylum for slaves who ran away.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:44.160]   There are rules related to slaves who loved their master and voluntarily committed himself.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.920]   There were lots of rules that did what?
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.600]   Protect them.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.760]   The word of God protected them.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:57.320]   Essentially even here you can see, yes, the word of God tells a slave to be obedient,
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:04.760]   but what comes next is telling masters, masters to regard the slaves with honor.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:14.400]   So what's very interesting is that in the spectrum of God, there is this incredible
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:19.840]   power in the gospel, incredible power in the realities of the relationship that God can
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:28.560]   produce where a slave can be obedient and render service even to a greater degree.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:35.640]   Now I want to ask you this really interesting question, which is this, can a godly master
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:39.840]   and slave relationship actually exist?
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:44.040]   And what's incredible about that is the obvious answer is yes, it can.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:50.600]   You see, what man perverts, what man continues to cause to become sour through his greed
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:58.280]   in the heart and turn into oppression, turn into abuse, turn into taking advantage of,
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.920]   turn into harm.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:03.840]   God is able to redeem even that relationship.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.600]   So let's take a look at the commands here.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:12.040]   Scripture here commands a slave to be obedient to those who are your earthly masters according
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.040]   to the flesh.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:20.320]   And verse seven it says, "With good will, render service as to the Lord."
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:27.400]   So what's really incredible here is Apostle Paul commands that the attitude behind the
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:34.880]   individual who is subservient would be obedient and with an intentional heart attitude desiring
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.000]   to serve.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.080]   And so one of the things that we want to notice here is that the whole passage here related
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:44.720]   to slaves has so much to do with attitude of the heart.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.600]   What I did was all I did was just list out from those two commands, the various portions
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:56.000]   that describe the condition of the heart behind obedience and service.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.960]   And what he says is, let's take a moment just to filter through some of these things.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:06.760]   He says that the slave should be obedient with fear and trembling.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:14.280]   Now by way of corollary to us, still to this day we have employer-employee relationships.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:18.960]   We have relationships where somebody is dictating to you what you need to do with your time
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:23.480]   and your resources, your intellect and your skill at this moment and you're going to get
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.720]   paid for it.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:30.520]   Basically they are giving you their agenda for you to accomplish.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.520]   They have authority.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:37.000]   And within this he says, show fear and trembling.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.280]   So my question is even for us, again, drawing that line and relating to this, are you showing
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.760]   respect and honor to your employers in your office?
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:53.240]   So many times we are tempted to see the deficiencies of our bosses and call them like, "Oh, that
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:32:00.320]   incompetent, that naive, that idiot, I should be in that position," whatever it may be.
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:05.360]   And one of the toughest things that's going to happen is with humility and respect to
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:10.240]   somebody who doesn't necessarily deserve that kind of honor, we give it.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.720]   We give the respect.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.720]   Why?
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:19.920]   Because Christ in his mastery over us, he deserves our respectful character.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.700]   What's more he says, in the sincerity of your heart.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:30.240]   So one, if we can summarize, the attitude of the heart that Christ desires from us is
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:36.280]   a respect, but also the attitude of the heart that Christ desires is sincerity, meaning
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.880]   there should be pure intentions.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.520]   When we're talking about sincerity, how are you to be sincere?
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.320]   It's like, "Oh, I really mean it."
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.080]   Like is that sincerity?
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:49.440]   Or is it more so talking about you sincerely desire the good?
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.440]   You sincerely want what's best for them.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.480]   You sincerely want what's best for the company.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.160]   And that is something that Christians can shine in.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:04.800]   When you care for your boss and you want your boss to do well, that kind of sincere intentionality
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.880]   for your boss will shine.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:07.920]   Because why?
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.580]   Because the wisdom of the world says, "I'm number one.
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:16.000]   I care whether I'm going to succeed, or I'm going to get credit for the work I put in,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   where I'm going to be respected, where I'm not going to be taken advantage of."
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.520]   But no, our heart and care for them says, "I'm going to make sure I think about that
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.240]   even for you."
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.720]   And therefore, you show the sincerity of your heart.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:34.340]   So within this, he says, "So not by way of eye service and as pleasers of men."
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:39.320]   So asking you, do you fake like you're being really productive at work?
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.120]   Like 50% of the time you're on Facebook and watching YouTube, and then whenever the boss
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.240]   walks by, it's like, "Oh, tab over."
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.280]   Are those the kind of things that we're doing?
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:53.080]   Or are we actually desiring to be intentionally serving well?
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:59.120]   The passage tells us that as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, that
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.360]   there is this motivation.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:07.120]   There is this internal desire and intent to do good and render service.
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:12.140]   So that's what I mean, those two categories of respect and pure intentions for you.
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:15.400]   Are you exhibiting that in your work?
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.440]   The next part of it, he gives us this rationale.
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:23.520]   It says, "Knowing that whatever good things each one does, this he will receive back from
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.760]   the Lord, whether slave or free."
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:32.440]   When we read verse eight, we ask the question in meditate, what is the rationale?
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:36.720]   When it says that you're supposed to keep this in mind when you go to work, what are
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.640]   you supposed to keep in mind?
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:44.360]   You're supposed to know, and you should have inside your head that, "Yes, I am getting
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:50.720]   paid a wage, a salary, or maybe whatever it may be, the benefits I receive."
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:56.720]   But you should have in mind, "Ultimately, I get my reward from my master."
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:02.200]   That every good thing I do in this workplace and every good thing I do within my day, none
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:07.560]   of that is in vain, even if I don't get a single applause or a single credit for it.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.560]   Why?
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.360]   Because by faith I know Christ is my master.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.640]   Because by faith I can look up and say, "I'm serving you."
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.040]   That should be in the back of our minds.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:26.000]   And so when that happens, I believe Christians should be some of the most motivated workers.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   We should be the one.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.920]   I mean, every job description says, "We want to look for a self-starter."
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.440]   You should be the self-starter.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.440]   Why?
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:39.840]   Because you have internally a master and a Lord and already a reward set for you.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.840]   You've been paid.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:48.600]   You should have this productiveness built into your system.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:52.760]   And when you think about the, you know, just, again, sometimes we drag our, again, we're
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.320]   tired.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.320]   Sometimes things aren't going well.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.120]   Sometimes things aren't efficient at work.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:04.440]   But when we show up, we should have this mentality of like, "I want to serve my Lord.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.720]   I want to do the best that I can."
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.720]   Why?
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:12.000]   Because He's both watching, but this is for His glory.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.840]   And so when it comes to this mentality, we have to really make sure that we are shining
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:19.840]   in that fashion.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:26.600]   Now, one of the things I want to highlight for you is in relation to all of this, I think
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:31.120]   this passage to me was kind of like a, "Wow, like I still want to meditate on it," is a
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:36.040]   passage in 1 Corinthians 7, verse 21 through 23.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.240]   Okay?
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:41.160]   So take a moment to turn there, 1 Corinthians 7, 21 through 23.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.720]   And the passage says, "Were you called while a slave?
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.220]   Don't worry about it.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:51.400]   But if you are able also to become free, rather do that.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:57.160]   For he who was called in the Lord while slave is the Lord's freed man.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:02.000]   Likewise, he who was called while free is Christ's slave.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.520]   You were bought with a price.
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.800]   Do not become slaves of men."
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.320]   I kind of think about that and meditate.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:15.160]   You know, like we're right now talking about sincerity of heart, motivation, the drive.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:19.080]   And I'm kind of thinking like, "Yeah, but at the same time," like immediately my head
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:22.160]   goes to, "Yeah, but at the same time, you don't want to be a fool.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.120]   You don't want to be just run over and taken advantage of at work."
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.120]   And that's actually all true.
[00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.360]   You have to be really wise in the way that you carry yourself because some things are
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.560]   just not just.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.560]   Okay?
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.520]   Some things are just truly not fair.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.240]   Like it's not right.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.400]   And you should be speaking truth and love.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.400]   Okay?
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:44.480]   But at the same time, you think about this passage where it's like to the slave, he says,
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.720]   "Were you a slave?
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.720]   Don't let it trouble you."
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.720]   Right?
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.720]   Whoa.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.720]   Okay?
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:56.120]   The slave is not getting any income.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:59.800]   The slave is not getting anything except you get to live in this house.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.800]   That's it.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.680]   You may not even be living in the main house.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:04.880]   Okay?
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.600]   So when you think about that, it's like the contrast.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:13.520]   God gave the slave a command that you need to still be godly in your circumstance.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.960]   Why?
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:19.600]   Because in the gospel of Christ, you have been free to the degree that in Christ, though
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:23.520]   you're a slave, you're a freed man.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.840]   So don't subject yourself like, "No, no, no.
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.160]   I still need to be paid by that guy."
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:32.440]   Why are you putting yourself underneath that man?
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.000]   You're a freed man in Christ.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:41.120]   I mean, if you take a moment just to meditate on that, like the gospel frees us from any
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:48.880]   contractual, like any dependency that I have, any desire for myself to want to be in this
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:55.120]   like contractual, I need the benefit from the people that I'm interacting with.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.640]   I'm freed from all that.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:57.640]   Why?
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:04.720]   Because the gospel frees us not just from oppression, not just from injustices.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:11.840]   The gospel frees us from this entire world, this fallen, broken, decaying world.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.280]   Okay.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:21.640]   So in the next part of it, the last portion, here it says to the masters, "Do the same
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:27.480]   things to them and give up threatening, knowing that both their master and yours is in heaven
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.520]   and there is no partiality with him."
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.920]   Notice how the passage says, "Do the same thing."
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.040]   And you should be asking like, "Whoa, that's crazy."
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:44.120]   Because he just told the slave to obey and then to render service.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.680]   Those are the two commands.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:49.320]   Now is it the same way to the masters then?
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:56.200]   I think what he's talking about is when we become saved in Christ, our desire now becomes
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:00.720]   to honor all that is vested in through God.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.920]   People are made in the image of God.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:08.320]   And so in the book of James, it says, "Don't you dare use your words to curse, to curse
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.080]   those who are made in the image of God."
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:17.760]   The individual being made by God vests value in that person.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:22.320]   And that person's identity then is held by God's creation.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:25.320]   And therefore, we give respect.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:30.000]   And so even masters who have the authority, even masters who have greater power and strength
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   are to show respect even to the slave.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.660]   And what's more, there should be a sincerity of heart.
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:40.760]   There should be good intention, goodwill.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:44.920]   And so just as a challenge for those of you guys who are employers, those of you guys
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:50.960]   who are in management positions, are you showing respect to your subordinates?
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:54.040]   Are you giving honor where honor is due?
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:57.280]   What's more, the passage says, "Give up threatening."
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.240]   Are you throwing your weight around?
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.200]   Are you doing the, "I'm older than you."
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.040]   Do you do that kind of stuff?
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:06.840]   When people don't listen, do you get angry with force?
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:11.600]   Do you demand, "You better listen to me."
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.200]   Is that our attitude?
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:17.120]   Or rather, are we doing what this passage is essentially challenging the masters and
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:22.000]   do the same, is to show that kind of same respect mutually.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:28.040]   And what's interesting here is that the rationale for all this is that the great equalizer is
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:31.800]   Christ our Lord.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:37.640]   You see, for any one of us who has been given authority, whether parent, manager, employer,
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:44.000]   boss, whatever you may be, our authority is so temporary.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:53.480]   We have been given a very temporary stewardship of responsibility.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:59.160]   And God has given us sufficient authority, not all-inclusive authority, but sufficient
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:04.600]   authority that we would hold those responsibilities well to care for the people underneath our
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.480]   management.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.520]   And that's the way we need to think of it.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:12.640]   And to me, this is kind of wild because when we think about the future, what's going to
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:19.440]   happen is whether we are slave or master, whether we're employer or employee, we are
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:24.120]   all going to kneel before Christ in the same way, giving account for our lives in the same
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.240]   way to the Lord.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.640]   But we don't even have to think about the future.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.640]   Why?
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:32.280]   Because think about the church.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:38.680]   When slavery existed, when people come to church and worship God, they sit in the pews
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.720]   the same.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:46.400]   And underneath God's perspective, the front row was not reserved for the mighty.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:50.040]   The front row were not reserved for those who were educated.
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.200]   The front row were not reserved for the elite.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.400]   He said, "No, you know what you should do?
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:56.400]   You should just go to the back."
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.800]   And he rebuked those individuals who wanted any kind of jockeying for position within
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.000]   the church.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:09.440]   But think about that scenery, where individuals who owned slaves, perhaps they were trading
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:14.840]   people, now be redeemed by Christ, they're convicted of their sins.
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:19.680]   And they realize they need to now look at the slave that they used to own, and in the
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:23.320]   church call him brother.
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:28.880]   Sit next to the other person, raise their hands in worship, kneel in prayer, because
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:32.920]   Christ Almighty is our great equalizer.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:36.640]   Before God, we're the same.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:41.920]   Before God, we're God the Father, we're his children, brothers and sisters.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.880]   Before Christ, we're his servants and bond slaves all together.
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.200]   That is a pretty incredible thing.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:54.960]   There is nothing that is going to have that kind of power to unify those kinds of people,
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:58.400]   to expect for the flesh to now turn.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:04.280]   I mean, imagine from the slave's perspective, to be asked to sit next to a former slave
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:11.240]   owner and to pray and worship together in the flesh, impossible.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:15.640]   Thanks be to God that in the gospel and the power of Christ, what is impossible with man
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:18.880]   is absolutely possible.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.560]   The gospel of God is so powerful, amen.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:26.360]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:37.560]   Lord, we think about what you have accomplished in our lives, and you have changed us from
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:46.320]   foolish, arrogant people who falsely thought that we could make our own way, who falsely
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:52.240]   thought that we could make our world better to preserve it, and then we ourselves become
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:55.360]   the master of our own domains.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:02.400]   Thank you, Lord, for saving us from that kind of folly, for showing us, Lord God, that this
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:08.120]   world is under condemnation, and we need to be saved from this perverse generation of
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:11.240]   which we are a part of.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:16.360]   Thank you, God, that you are showing us that to us, what is our great glory is to be found
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.520]   in Christ, to be changed.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:24.560]   And Lord, what's more, thank you, God, that you have called us in to your household, to
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:28.240]   be your children, obedient to the Father.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:32.960]   I pray, Lord, that you would continue to teach us what it means to humble our hearts and
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.880]   to obey you as our loving Heavenly Father.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:42.040]   God, we recognize that in so many different facets of our lives, we still try so hard
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:48.360]   to grip and maintain our own control, but I pray, God, that you'd grant to us humility.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:55.000]   Lord, you'd grant to us submission of heart in trust, in trust of your goodness, and in
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   trust of your sovereignty.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.600]   Lord, within this generation and this time now, there is so much conflict.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:07.400]   There is so much angst and indignation, but I pray, Father God, that we would have so
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:15.440]   much more confidence to turn to the gospel, to reconcile any of the woes, any of the sins
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:21.280]   that we see in our own hearts and in the world, to realize, Father God, that in the flesh,
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:24.400]   we are completely incapable.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:29.880]   And what's more, not only that, but even good laws and good intentions are not enough.
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.760]   And therefore, what the law cannot accomplish, only Christ can do.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.280]   Father, we want to thank you again.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.280]   It's in Christ.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.280]   Let me pray.
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:37.280]   Amen.
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:47.140]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
