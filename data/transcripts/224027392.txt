[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.500]   Heavenly Father, we come before you desiring to know your Word.
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.220]   We pray that our study would lead us to a greater and more specific vision of who you
[00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.900]   are.
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.340]   Help us, Lord God, not to be caught off guard like the world, that your coming would be
[00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.420]   like a thief in the night.
[00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.140]   Help us, Lord, to watch carefully that we may live sober lives, knowing, Father, that
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.680]   this life is passing.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.500]   Help us to know the signs of the times, Lord God, that we may live lives truly worthy of
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.480]   the calling that you've given.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.900]   We ask that you would bless this time, that your Word would go forth and that your people
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.700]   would hear the voice of your Son, Jesus, and that they may follow him.
[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.180]   So we pray for your blessing this afternoon.
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.180]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.180]   Amen.
[00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:04.380]   All right, so we're looking at chapter eight of the book of Revelation.
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:14.820]   So if you look at the picture that I got from Google here, you'll see each one of these
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.460]   horns actually depicts the picture that you hopefully remember from your reading.
[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.700]   So just get a one glimpse and you kind of digest that, okay?
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.780]   It's amazing what you can do with Google.
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.300]   Just type in "seven trumpets of Revelation" and boom, there it is.
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.940]   All right.
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.820]   So in the beginning, in Revelation chapter eight, remember there was a, if you remember
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.180]   the seven seals, that the first four seals, what were the first four seals?
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.780]   First four seals.
[00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.220]   Anybody remember?
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.780]   The horsemen, four horsemen, right?
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.860]   Each of the horsemen.
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.020]   Anybody remember the order?
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:12.700]   White, red, black and pale.
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.700]   Okay.
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.700]   So those are the four.
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.220]   And then after that, the fifth seal is talking about the martyrs, right?
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.940]   And then the sixth seal, there's an intense judgment on the sixth seal.
[00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.180]   And then there's kind of a parenthetical statement.
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.060]   Chapter seven was a description of the 144,000.
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.980]   And then it describes the multitudes that are seen in heaven when they're all in worship,
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.980]   right?
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.460]   And then chapter eight begins with the last seal, the seventh seal.
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.380]   Remember the question I asked you, like if you look at the seven seals and the seven
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.380]   trumpets and the seven bowl judgments, like are they overlapping each other?
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.700]   Or are the seven trumpets, like within the seventh seal and the seventh seal, it opens
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.700]   up the seven trumpets.
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.700]   What do you think?
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.700]   You don't have to say anything.
[00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:10.260]   I just want you to think for a little bit, right?
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.020]   Do you understand my question?
[00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.340]   Is this seven years, right?
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:23.260]   Or seven different judgments that are overlapping each other, seven seals, seven trumpets, the
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.300]   seven bowls, it's talking about the seven different things, but it's talking about the
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.420]   same time period.
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:38.020]   Or is it seven years and then on the seventh year, it opens up the seventh trumpet.
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:45.020]   And then at the end of the seventh, at the seventh, was it the trumpet, it opens up the
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.380]   seven bowl judgments.
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.700]   Okay.
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.620]   So, that's the question.
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.140]   I just want you to be thinking about it because obviously if you're trying to look for the
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.140]   application of some of these things, it would make a big difference if you're looking at
[00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.980]   it as this increasing and intensified, or if it's seven years just overlapping, talking
[00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.420]   about different kinds of judgments.
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.940]   So there are different views on both, right?
[00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.620]   Now, remember we talked about there are different approaches to the interpretation of the book
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.620]   of Revelation.
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.940]   So, if you happen to be a part of the group that looks at the book of Revelation as already
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.500]   fulfilled prophecies, meaning that it was talking about Rome, it was talking about the
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.460]   Roman soldiers coming in and destroying the temple and all of this judgment is allegorical
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.900]   about some historical event, right?
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.500]   If you believe or if you've been taught that that's how we ought to look at Revelation,
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.820]   these are all fulfilled prophecies that happened.
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.060]   And so, when you read the commentaries, they're going to tell you that it looks like these
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.500]   are the Romans and this is what happened in AD 90 or the gathering of the early church,
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.660]   but these are all fulfilled prophecies, right?
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.940]   Now, again, you don't have to answer me, but if you look at the prophecies that are laid
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:09.500]   out so far up to where we've come, remember I told you that you're going to see an increase
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.260]   in intensity of these judgments?
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.340]   Remember I told you that?
[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.860]   And I'm sure you probably noticed it already.
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.660]   The trumpet judgments are much more intense than the judgments that you saw with the seal
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.860]   judgments.
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.340]   And then the bowl judgments are always going to take it to a next level.
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.300]   So if you haven't read the bowl judgments, you're probably wondering what could possibly
[00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.740]   happen that's going to be even more intense than what you've seen, but that's exactly
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.740]   what you're going to see.
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.620]   There's an increase in intensity.
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.780]   Now, if you were to try to apply that in the first century as it being fulfilled, in my
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.300]   opinion it's very difficult to apply that because it's extremely grossly exaggerated,
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.940]   meaning a third of the heavens, a third of the sea, a third of mankind.
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.340]   You know, I mean, so unless you're interpreting a third as, you know, a certain small portion,
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.580]   a third represents a number of something and you have to allegorically apply it, it's really
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:10.260]   difficult to apply that, you know, unless you really allegorize every single thing that
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.180]   they say, right?
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.780]   That's why I think it's very difficult to try to see that all that was fulfilled in
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.980]   the first century, that it seems like to me that this is revelation of some intense judgment
[00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.580]   that's coming at some point in the future, and I think that's the best way to look at
[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.580]   that, okay?
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.620]   Well, we're at chapter one.
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.180]   It opens up the seventh seal and it doesn't tell us a whole lot about that other than
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.260]   the fact that there's silence, right?
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.580]   So there seems to be a kind of a pause of silence and presence of God or before God
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.460]   unleashing great judgment.
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.140]   So in the Bible, whenever there is a moment of pause or silence, it's because there's
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:58.420]   a sense of awe, either God has showed up and they're in terror or fear, or God is about
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.540]   to speak and say something and so everybody's just kind of staying hushed and silent and
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.820]   it seems kind of like that's what's happening, right?
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.860]   The two verses, I'm going to call it that.
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:15.100]   All right, so the two verses I put up there in Zephaniah 1-7, it says, "Be silent before
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.140]   the Lord God for the day of the Lord is near.
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.420]   The Lord has prepared a sacrifice and consecrated his guests."
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.940]   So the Lord is about to bring judgment and he says, "Be silent."
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.980]   And Zechariah 2-13, "Be silent all flesh before the Lord for he has roused himself
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.120]   from his holy dwelling."
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:37.060]   So not just these two verses, I mean, I can find many other passages where God, right
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:43.180]   before he acts, there's kind of a dramatic pause, almost kind of like he wants everybody
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.860]   to pay attention to what either he's going to say or what he's going to do.
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.500]   And in this case, clearly what he's about to do.
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:56.820]   So there's a moment of silence and considering what we see after and each one of these trumpet
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.060]   judgments come and it's just devastation after devastation.
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.660]   If one thing doesn't wipe you out, the next thing comes and if you somehow survive that,
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:09.300]   the next thing comes and it just kind of keeps adding and then you think you're kind of at
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.580]   the end and then boom, you have the seal judgments that's going to come in.
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:18.220]   You know, when I thought about this, this moment of silence before the trumpets are,
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.780]   you know, we move on to the trumpet judgments.
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.460]   I remember, I don't know, some of you guys may remember, I don't know how old you were
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:29.900]   when 9/11 happened, but I remember I got a phone call from somebody who was my youth
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.900]   student years ago and I haven't talked to her in a while and then she called me out
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:38.540]   of the blue early in the morning and she said, "Hey, Peter, you got to turn on the television
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.180]   because something's going on."
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:45.380]   And I turn on and the plane, the first plane has already crashed and it was burning.
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:51.860]   Now, you know, for a split second, it's so surreal because the Twin Tower in New York
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.540]   is kind of like the, what do you call it, the Statue of Liberty.
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.340]   I mean, that's been there as long as I can remember.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.340]   You know, it was a tourist attraction.
[00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.660]   It was one of the main things that you think of when you think of United States, it was
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:08.140]   Twin Tower and to have it, an airplane crashed and then seeing that burning and then hearing
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:13.020]   all these other news about how another plane is headed toward the Pentagon and how that
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.020]   went, crashed.
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.900]   And then I remember watching this thing and then right in the middle of watching it, another
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.380]   plane crashes into the other tower, you know, and this is all live on television.
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:29.540]   And obviously the whole country is just, we were just shocked and all, just probably in
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:35.020]   silence and then not too long after that, the first one drops and the thought of, oh
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:41.100]   my gosh, that building probably holds at least 40, 50,000 people, you know, and then it crashed.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.340]   So we don't know exactly how many, at that time, we didn't know exactly how many people
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.580]   were in the building.
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:52.380]   And then there's this, this, this sense of, I didn't call it like dread that the other
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.180]   building is also going to fall, you know.
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.980]   And I remember thinking about that and I remember reading this and thinking about this dead
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:04.140]   silence that falls on, on, in heaven for 30 minutes as that kind of scene, like you, you
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:09.100]   know something terrible is about to happen and it's imminent and it's going to happen,
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:15.460]   it's God ordained, but you, you kind of are watching it and it's going to, it's slowly
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.620]   beginning to unfold, but it's unbelievable.
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.380]   And it just kind of made me think about that scene, that, that, how I felt at that minute,
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.220]   that moment when those things began to fall.
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:29.960]   And it just shocked, I mean, obviously the whole nation was in shock.
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.780]   But that's basically how chapter eight opens, right?
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:39.180]   The last seal is open and this dead silence and the silence isn't everybody just being
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.460]   quiet and just resting.
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:44.300]   It's dead silence because something, something horrendous is about to happen.
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:48.220]   God's judgment is about to be unleashed and it's almost kind of like heaven knows what's,
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.940]   what's about to come.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.880]   And they're, they're just fearfully and in awe watching.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.500]   And that's exactly what happens.
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:01.100]   Once it opens up and then the trumpets begin to blow, the judgments begin to unravel and
[00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.220]   every one of these judgments could, could be the end of the world, but it just keeps
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.900]   coming one after another.
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.640]   Right?
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:18.180]   So we look, we see the seven angels, they're given seven trumpets to blow to initiate the
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.940]   second set of judgments.
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:20.940]   Right?
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:25.500]   And we're not told exactly who these angels are, but we are told early on in chapter one
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.820]   and two that there are seven angels above the seven churches.
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:36.440]   So we're not sure if it's those angels or a different set of angels.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.140]   And the trumpets in the scripture were used for all kinds of purposes.
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:44.200]   I mean, I'm not going to go through all of them, but to either gather people or sign
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:51.020]   of warning for the tribes to, to maybe scatter during times of war.
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:57.740]   Here it seems like it's being blown kind of, kind of like it happens in Zephaniah 1, 14
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:01.940]   and 16, like that, that it's heralding the day of God's wrath.
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.940]   So let me read you that passage.
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.940]   Now come back to that.
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.540]   The great day of the Lord is near, near and hastening fast.
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.700]   The sound of the day of the Lord is bitter.
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.420]   The mighty man cries aloud there.
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:17.380]   A day of wrath is that day, a day of distress and anguish, a day of ruin and devastation,
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:22.500]   a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness, a day of trumpet blast
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:27.700]   and battle cry against the fortified cities and against the lofty battlements.
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:33.300]   I mean, if you, if you think about the way that the second coming of Christ is revealed
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:38.780]   to us in scripture, you know, obviously as Christians, we look forward to the consummation
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.540]   of Christ's coming and redeeming the church.
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:47.700]   But before he does that, before we are caught up into heaven and we are in his bosom for
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.860]   eternity, all this is going to unravel.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:56.060]   And it is going to be like something that we've never seen before.
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:01.980]   And again, that's the silence that comes upon them, the whole heaven.
[00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:07.580]   And so basically the blowing of the trumpets is a warning sign for everyone to pay attention
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:13.220]   that this is exactly what's happening so that there's no, there's no mistake that this is
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.460]   not just a natural disaster.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:21.620]   This was not just a mistake that what is about to happen is God ordained.
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:26.540]   So they blow the trumpet, "Hey, God is about to act and it's going to be terrible what's
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:27.900]   about to happen."
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:43.460]   But he wants everybody to know that this is not, this is God ordained.
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.780]   Right after that in verse three, it says, "Another angel came and stood at the altar
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.400]   with a golden censer.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.980]   And he was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints and on the golden
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:53.180]   altar before the throne."
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:58.540]   So aside from the seven, it seems like there's another angel that appears and he seems like
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:03.900]   there's, he has more authority than the other seven because he's the one giving instructions
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.140]   and he's the one who's throwing out the judgment.
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:12.620]   Now there are several angels in the Bible that actually given names and I'm sure there's
[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.860]   more than, more than these that are mentioned, but there are two in particular that's of
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.080]   interest to us.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:25.660]   The angel Gabriel in Daniel 8, 15 to 27, he appears there and he interprets the visions
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:32.080]   and he's the one who's speaking to Daniel and opening his ears and the minds of people
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.140]   so that they can understand the vision of God.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:40.860]   Luke chapter 119 is where Gabriel appears and he prophesies about the coming of the
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.140]   Messiah.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.980]   So this angel, it seems like he's not just an ordinary angel.
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.020]   He is maybe one of the top angels, right?
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.660]   But we know that he's not the top angel because there's another angel.
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:01.300]   There's another angel mentioned in the Bible and he's the archangel, the chief angel.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.180]   Anybody remember his name?
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.180]   Huh?
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.700]   Michael, right?
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.420]   Michael is called the archangel, meaning that he is the captain.
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.880]   He's the chief of all the angels.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.180]   And this is probably where Satan was.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:24.140]   So archangel Michael may have been a subordinate to Satan, but after Satan falls, he takes
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.580]   his place, right?
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:31.660]   Now obviously the other angel that's mentioned is Lucifer, Satan.
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.180]   He's also mentioned, but I didn't put that up there.
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:38.800]   So we don't know if this angel, this particular angel that comes and he's the one who's throwing
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:45.100]   the fire down on the earth, but because he's not specifically named by name.
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:52.040]   But again, we know that Michael, archangel Michael and Gabriel, these two are, they appear
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.620]   throughout the scriptures and they're the ones who are conveying God's message and speaking
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.840]   to the prophets.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:05.860]   And again, in Michael, he's mentioned in Jude 9 where speaking of Satan, he says, you know,
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:12.120]   the Lord rebuke you, and then he's rebuking the church at that time for taking Satan lightly.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:18.340]   That even archangel Michael, you know, not respect as in reverence, but respect his power
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.720]   to not to just go against Satan and talk about him loosely like that because he's powerful.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:30.380]   So you know, if you look at, again, the biblical account, Lucifer was above Michael, right?
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:37.420]   So he's, so in book of Jude verse 9, it tells us to be careful.
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:42.520]   Now again, we don't know if it's one of these two, but it would be fitting if they were
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.040]   because that's how they're presented to us in the other parts of scripture.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:53.980]   So you know, there's a whole spiritual realm that is mentioned in the scripture that we
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.760]   don't typically pay a lot of attention to because there's not a lot of details, right?
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.720]   Of angels, of fallen angels, Satan.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.840]   In fact, there's other name that we're going to run into, I think in chapter 10, the beast,
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:10.260]   the dragon, there's all these different things that are being presented in the scripture
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:16.920]   that we kind of vaguely know, but we don't really understand the spiritual realm.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:22.480]   But there's definitely a world that you and I don't understand in the spiritual realm.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.920]   That's why the scripture always says that our God is the God of heaven, earth, and under
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:33.320]   the earth, meaning that there's a, there's all of this is God's creation.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.740]   That it's not just a physical world that exists.
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.740]   There's a whole new world.
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:44.400]   In fact, the spiritual world in some sense may be more real than this because once we
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:50.380]   die, we're going to be in glorified bodies and we're going to be with Christ, right?
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.360]   So again, I think it's interesting for us to think about all this because there's a
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:18:00.440]   whole aspect of the spiritual realm that we don't really think about, but I think we should.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.120]   I think we should because it's there for a reason.
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.120]   There are spiritual things going on that we don't know.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:11.560]   So there's a spiritual warfare that is going on that the scripture calls us to participate
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.560]   in.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:18.000]   That our real war is not against flesh and blood, it says, right?
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.060]   It's against spiritual forces of powers in high places.
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:28.240]   So what is being revealed to us in Revelation, right?
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.840]   In the epistles it tells us about it.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.640]   We just don't know the details.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:37.800]   But this is the scene that the scripture tells us is happening in our daily lives, either
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.360]   in some sense is participating in this war.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.360]   And we see that, right?
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:47.240]   Later on we'll see that in the prayers of the saints, how our prayers are lifted up
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:51.120]   and it plays a role in the unraveling of all of this stuff, right?
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.800]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:59.080]   I'll mention it again when we get there, okay?
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.280]   The scene in heaven suggests that there is something sacrificial about our prayers, which
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.960]   I just mentioned.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.900]   And both the believer and his prayer enter the presence of God by way of the altar.
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:18.480]   So it says in verse four, "In the smoke of the incense with the prayers of the saints,"
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:23.920]   you notice how the incense was something that you offered up at the altar, but along with
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.240]   that the prayer of the saints rose before God from the hand of the angel, right?
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.920]   "Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:37.800]   the earth, and there were peals of thunder, rumbling flashes of lightning, and an earthquake."
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:47.120]   It almost seems like what's about to happen happens as a response to prayer, right?
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.160]   Where these prayers and the incense and the sacrifices are going up to God, and then he
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:57.080]   takes these incense, right, and then that's what he throws to the ground.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:05.320]   And then earthquake and fire and rumbling and flashes, they begin to take place.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:13.420]   Now why do you think that the saints, our prayers, we don't know exactly how and what
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:17.880]   role it plays, but clearly it involves us.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.480]   We're not just onlookers just observing and saying, "Oh, God's acting."
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:26.000]   We are actually in some sense participating through prayer, through spiritual warfare,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   right?
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.160]   It doesn't say God responded to this particular prayer and he's answering these prayers.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.160]   He doesn't say that.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:37.380]   He doesn't go into the detail, but it does say that in response these incense and these
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:42.040]   prayers go up, and when it receives, is on the throne, and it kind of triggers this judgment
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.840]   coming upon mankind, right?
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:51.720]   Now if you think about it, in the previous passage it says that the martyrs were crying
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   out to God.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.880]   Remember what they were crying out?
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:03.480]   In the previous, I think it was the fifth seal, the martyrs, they were crying out, "How
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.920]   long, O God?"
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.760]   To vindicate them, right?
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.600]   Against their enemies.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:19.040]   And so, so much of their prayer is basically asking God to step in in this spiritual battle.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.200]   Yes?
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.400]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:27.000]   So during all of this happening, it seems like the persecution and the suffering of
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.440]   the Christians are increasing, and in that context, as the suffering of the Christians
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:36.400]   are increasing, they are crying out to God, and it is their prayers that this angel takes
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:41.680]   up, and then that triggers the next judgment that comes, right?
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.680]   In response.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.480]   So when the full, remember he says, you know, that he's not going to come, the end is not
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.520]   going to come until, what does he say?
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:54.400]   There's other brothers and sisters who are going to be added to this number of martyrs,
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.400]   right?
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.400]   Remember that?
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.460]   In the fifth seal?
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:03.920]   And so it seems like when this judgment happens, is a fullness of number may have come, and
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.720]   their prayers, their crying is reaching up to God, and God responds, and then the judgment
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.160]   begins, the trumpet judgment begins.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:20.600]   That's what it seems like, right?
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:25.840]   The seven trumpet judgments, before we get into it, are divided into two groups, and
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:31.520]   again, very similar to the seal judgments, if you remember, the four horsemen, and then
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:38.760]   the fifth seal is kind of like a, fifth and sixth seal are different than the first four,
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.760]   and then there's almost a break between the sixth and the seventh, and that's exactly
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.120]   how the trumpet judgments are laid out.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:50.040]   The first four are natural disasters, just one after another, and then we get to the
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:55.200]   fifth and sixth, it's the judgments differ a bit, and then there's a long break.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:03.240]   In fact, chapter nine, no, chapter 10 and chapter 11 is kind of a parenthesis, where
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.200]   the sixth seal is opened up, and then all these other things are mentioned, it's kind
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.880]   of like a parenthesis.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:15.900]   And then it doesn't, the seventh trumpet doesn't even open up until end of chapter 11, right?
[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:20.840]   So it's kind of like the outline or the break is very similar to the seal judgments, the
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.260]   trumpet judgments.
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:26.480]   And that's why some people think that maybe this is overlapping, because the theme seems
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:32.040]   very similar, right?
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:38.280]   Which I already mentioned, the first four are plagues directed toward the world of nature,
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:44.040]   whether it is the mountains or the earth or the sea, but there's intense judgments that
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.080]   are coming.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:51.080]   And then the fifth and sixth are separated from the seventh trumpet in parenthesis, right,
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.040]   before the final trumpet blows.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:24:00.440]   And then the intensity of this judgment, trumpet judgment, becomes progressively more intense
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:08.520]   in comparing to the seal judgments.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:18.480]   So imagine, which we're going to get to in a bit, this judgment is like, if we're not
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:22.880]   mistaken, and this is exactly what's going to happen.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:28.960]   And I know there's an element in the church that allegorizes all of this stuff, and that
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.120]   maybe a lot of this stuff is talking about what happened in the first century and it's
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.160]   not going to happen.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.760]   But to me, it doesn't make sense.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.800]   I don't think that that's the best way to interpret this.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.000]   I think this is going to happen.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.200]   And I also think that we are, as a church, going to go through the tribulation, because
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.400]   the language that I see is that He's going to preserve us through all of this stuff,
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:56.440]   meaning that not to take us out, but to give us strength to test the real faith.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.280]   So people who have real faith and people who don't have faith are going to be changed.
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:05.440]   And one of the reasons why I believe that the best way to interpret all of this is to
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.080]   take it as literally as possible.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.680]   Some of them are obvious that you're not supposed to take it literally, but a lot of
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:16.680]   times, as much as possible, because if you look at the prophecies that are fulfilled
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:21.320]   through Christ, it was literal.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:26.480]   Where He was born, how He was going to die, how He was going to suffer, somebody was going
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:31.520]   to betray Him, He was going to ride on a donkey, He was going to be nailed on a tree, the leaders
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.000]   are going to betray Him.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.880]   So if you look at the prophecies that talk about Christ, so much of that was word for
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.300]   word fulfilled.
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:45.400]   And Jesus kept on saying over and over again that this has happened to fulfill prophecy,
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.040]   to fulfill prophecy.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:52.680]   And so it seems to me the more consistent way to understand prophecy is to take it as
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.360]   literally as possible, because remember, the Jews couldn't understand.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:01.880]   A lot of the passages that they couldn't understand, they just kind of shelved.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.360]   Going back at it, it says all these things are about me.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.720]   You go to Isaiah 53 and all these prophecies, now we're looking back at it, clearly that
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.240]   must be talking about Christ.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.720]   But it didn't fit their image of Christ.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.040]   Christ was going to come and conquer, He's going to be our King, why would He be suffering?
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.040]   Why would He be meek?
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.740]   Why would He be riding on a donkey?
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:23.580]   And so all of these things didn't fit, so they just kind of shelved it.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.920]   You go back and look at it, it's clear.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:33.440]   So I think we look at the book of Revelation that as much as we can or clearly seems like
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:39.800]   we should interpret literally, that we should take it literally, right?
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:47.440]   Now the reason why I say all of this stuff is if all this stuff is going to happen literally,
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:52.700]   think about the devastation that's coming before He comes to redeem His church.
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.380]   Think about what's going to happen to this earth.
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.080]   Think about what's going to happen to the people.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:05.280]   And all the time invested to make this place a beautiful place, heaven on earth, like preserve
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.280]   and recycling.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:12.420]   I'm not against recycling, but I'm just saying like so much time and effort and energy and
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:17.860]   heartache is going into preserving this place when the scripture says that God is going
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:22.660]   to ordain this, that this is coming.
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:27.120]   So again, I'm not against recycling, I'm not against social justice, all that stuff.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:32.520]   I think Christians should be responsible, but our primary duty should be to save people
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:37.080]   from this, right?
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:41.560]   Primary duty, primary motivation for Christians is to save people from the wrath of God that's
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.880]   coming, right?
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.080]   And I think that's what was intended.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.120]   Whether we fully understand how it's going to be fulfilled or not, the intention is so
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.960]   that we would live soberly and that we would evangelize other people knowing that this
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:57.000]   is coming, right?
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.240]   And Luke chapter 21, 25, 26, Jesus says, "And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.800]   and on the earth distress of nations and perplexity because of the roaring of the sea and the
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.360]   waves, people fainting with fear and with foreboding of what is coming in the world
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.440]   for the powers of the heavens will be shaken."
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:28.840]   So Jesus himself said that these are signs that you ought to be watching for.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.360]   So the first judgment.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.680]   And you'll notice that the term "a third," "a third of the heavens," "a third of the
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.260]   surface" is going to be consumed, right?
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:49.500]   So first thing that he says in verse 7, "The first angel blew his trumpet and there followed
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:54.780]   hail fire mixed with blood and these are thrown upon the earth and a third of the earth was
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:29:00.700]   burned up and a third of the trees were burned up and all the green grass was burned up."
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:08.500]   So the first trumpet blows and right off the bat, just utter devastation, a third.
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:12.820]   A third of the trees being burned up, which means that all the fruits needed for food
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:13.820]   will be gone with it.
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:18.120]   So again, because you and I don't live in the farm and we go to the supermarket to get
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.160]   our food.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.180]   So imagine if you were living at that time saying a third of the trees are being burnt
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:24.180]   up.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.180]   What does that mean?
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.980]   You know, it would be equivalent to saying like a third of the supermarkets are going
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.980]   to be shut down, right?
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:34.900]   A third of the resource for whatever that sustains you is going to be wiped out.
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.420]   So imagine the kind of famine that's going to create, right?
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:43.300]   Not only a third of the trees, but what does it mean for a third of the grass?
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:49.700]   You know, people primarily, either you were a fisherman or you were a carpenter, but a
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:54.660]   lot of people were living off the land and your wealth was measured by your livestock.
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:58.180]   So you had goat or you had sheep or cows or whatever.
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:02.420]   So if all the third of the grass is wiped out, what does that mean?
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.100]   Not a third, all of the grass is wiped out.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.720]   Your livestock can't survive, right?
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:13.260]   So today we may think all grass is gone and say, "Oh, our house is going to look ugly,"
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:17.340]   you know, because we don't think of grass as food or somehow sustaining us.
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:23.620]   But think of it at that time when all the grass is gone, it basically means no livestock.
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:28.740]   Your livelihood is going to be gone.
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:34.780]   And then the second, verses eight and nine, right?
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:41.340]   So not only the third of the earth, the trees and all of the grass, but even the sea.
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:46.060]   Verse eight, "The second angel blew his trumpet and something like a great mountain burning
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:51.060]   with fire was thrown into the sea and a third of the sea became blood."
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:31:01.220]   What does that sound like?
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:04.860]   So it says, "The trumpet, something like a great mountain burning with fire."
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:18.060]   What does that sound like?
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:26.060]   Could be a comet, falling star maybe, volcano maybe, right?
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:32.620]   We don't know, but when I think of mountain burning, the first image that I have is maybe
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:39.420]   a volcano, but this volcano has to be gigantic because it's going to destroy a third, right?
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:43.380]   Third thrown into the sea and a third of the sea became blood.
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:47.060]   And it said, "A third of the living creatures in the sea died and a third of the ships were
[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.060]   destroyed."
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.300]   So basically not only land, right?
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.860]   But everything that we know, even the ships will be destroyed.
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:56.900]   That's how devastating this is going to be, whether that's an earthquake or maybe a comet,
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:57.900]   right?
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:04.900]   A lot of people, I remember when I was younger, you know, like pastors or people would give
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:10.300]   seminars on the end times and whenever they would get to these scenes, they would always
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:16.060]   equate it to a nuclear fallout because the devastation is so huge.
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:20.900]   Like what could possibly happen that a third, right?
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.900]   It can't be just any volcano.
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:32.540]   Volcano is not going to destroy a third, but maybe an earthquake, maybe an asteroid, right?
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.820]   And then some people say it could be a nuclear bomb, maybe.
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:36.820]   You know what's interesting?
[00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:41.820]   I don't know if I have it in my next slide.
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.540]   It says a third of the creatures are going to be destroyed in the sea.
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.260]   So the livelihood for their food, even in the sea.
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.860]   So you happen to be a fisherman, right?
[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.300]   It's like, "Oh, we're safe because we don't have livestock."
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:58.220]   It's like, "Well, even fishermen are going to be affected by that."
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:03.740]   And at that time, at least, you know, where they are in Galilee, obviously more people,
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.540]   you know, probably were eating fish.
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:12.580]   But the devastation, the point is that devastation is going to be very thorough and no one's
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:29.460]   going to be exempt.
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:37.620]   The third trumpet, the plague is going to consist of burning star that falls from the
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:42.140]   sky and the inland water is turning bitter and causing the death of many people.
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:47.580]   This is where I remember very specifically a pastor was giving a seminar on this.
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:51.340]   And you know, like, I don't know if you've ever been to a seminar about like, you know,
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:55.020]   not to get chips in your arm or tattoos that's the mark of the beast.
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:34:00.140]   And you know, the Left Behind series kind of got everybody stirred up when that book
[00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.140]   first came out and they made a movie out of it.
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:07.580]   So a lot of people were talking about the end times, even in Presbyterian churches,
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.420]   because that movie like really made an impact on everybody.
[00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:14.840]   And I remember one of the things specifically he said, he mentioned this particular passage
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:24.900]   in verse 11, the word wormwood.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:25.900]   What's a wormwood?
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.900]   Does anybody know?
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.180]   No botanist.
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:33.780]   Okay.
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.820]   So, wormwood basically is just bitter herbs.
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:43.660]   And so the word wormwood is equated in scripture with something bitter.
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:46.580]   God's going to bring judgment and honey is going to turn to wormwood.
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.100]   And so the scripture uses the term wormwood.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.700]   You know, what's interesting is, again, when I was younger, a pastor was giving this seminar
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:59.380]   and he said, and he thinks that this judgment, this particular judgment is a nuclear fallout.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:05.300]   And the reason why he believed that and he was saying it's being fulfilled was, you know,
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:08.500]   some of you guys may remember, no, you're not going to remember, but you probably read
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.500]   about it.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:16.580]   Remember the Chernobyl, the nuclear fallout and it destroyed thousands of people, homes,
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:20.340]   and it's still abandoned today because of the fallout.
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.420]   You know what that city was called?
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.420]   Wormwood.
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.460]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:28.460]   Look it up.
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.700]   I didn't believe it either, but it's called Wormwood.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.700]   Go look it up.
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.700]   Go Google it, Wikipedia.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.940]   All right, Wormwood, Chernobyl.
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.220]   So the name of that city was Wormwood.
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.540]   So I remember that pastor was going nuts over this.
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:45.780]   Like this Wormwood, you see it's being fulfilled, it's happening now.
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:52.100]   Whether it is or not, I thought it was interesting that a lot of this massive devastation, like
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:56.260]   what could cause a third of the earth, a third of this, a third of the sea?
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:58.020]   I mean, it could be.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:08.180]   I mean, it doesn't mean it has to be, but it could be.
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:14.940]   But only other thing is, let me before we get to that, whether it is a nuclear fallout
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:19.940]   or whether it's natural, I think one thing that is going to be for sure that there's
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.660]   no, there's not going to be guessing.
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:26.180]   Remember when 9/11 happened, a lot of people were like, "Oh, this is a judgment from God,"
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:31.180]   or you know, when that tsunami hit Indonesia and all these hundreds of thousands of people
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.180]   died.
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:35.380]   "Oh, that's judgment from God," and there's debate even within the church.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.980]   I think the only difference at the end when devastation comes, whether it comes through
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:44.300]   natural disaster or through maybe a World War III or nuclear bomb, that there isn't
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:49.220]   going to be any debate that God did it, that this is the judgment of God, because it clearly
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.220]   says it.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.500]   There is no debate.
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:58.100]   At the end of all of this, the response from people is that because God is coming to judge,
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:59.740]   they don't repent.
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:04.700]   They harden their hearts even further, meaning that they know full well that it was God,
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.380]   but they refuse to acknowledge Him.
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.660]   So that's the difference at the end when these things happen.
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.500]   It's not going to be like, "Oh, is God in this?"
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:15.100]   It's like, no, God is coming and it's going to be for sure, it's going to be known that
[00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.780]   it was Him.
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:20.100]   The fourth trumpet is where we're going to be ending today.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:24.820]   The third of the sun, moon, stars were struck with a blow that darkened them for a third
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:29.540]   of the day and the night.
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:34.980]   So if you really think about it, and all the other devastations that happen, and just darkness
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:41.500]   a third of the night doesn't seem as bad, but in Scripture, darkness is always symbolism
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:50.780]   of judgment.
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:55.020]   In fact, it almost seems like, remember when we talked about, Dr. Harris talked about the
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:38:00.700]   darkness that fell upon from 12 to 3, and it was God coming to judge His Son?
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:06.900]   And again, he made that case about how every important ratification of a covenant, God
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:11.820]   appears and He kind of covers because men cannot stand to be in the presence of His
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:12.820]   glory.
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:18.340]   That it almost seems like the earth goes dark because God is appearing, and when He appears,
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.340]   there's judgment.
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:25.980]   Because unless you're covered by the blood of Christ, when God appears, you die.
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:32.780]   And so it almost seems like the fourth judgment that's going to come is going to be devastating.
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:38.260]   And then finally, the fourth trumpet judgment concludes with a cry from an eagle saying,
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:40.620]   "Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth."
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:45.340]   So these three woes are prophecy of the next three judgments that are coming, the fifth,
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:47.060]   sixth, and seventh.
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:52.060]   So obviously, woe is prophecy of judgment coming, and then it's threefold, woe, woe,
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.060]   woe.
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:57.760]   So remember, we learned that anything that is repeated in Scripture is for the purpose
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.020]   of emphasis, right?
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:05.580]   So truly, truly, I say to you means pay attention.
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:10.740]   When it says God is holy, holy, holy, means that that's highlighted above all of His other
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:11.900]   nature.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.200]   So here it says, "Woe, woe, woe."
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.940]   So it's in reference to the woes that are coming, the next three judgments that are
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.380]   coming is going to be escalating in intensity.
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:26.780]   So can you imagine that we're only halfway through the judgments and the woes haven't
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:29.020]   started yet, right?
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.820]   The woes are coming, the three woes are coming.
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:35.380]   So that's where we're ending today, and we're going to get to chapter nine, and the real
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.580]   devastation is coming.
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:43.340]   So all of this stuff, it lays out in Revelation, again, so that we would pay attention, so
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.360]   that we would not be caught off guard.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:52.580]   So if you know any of this and you're looking for it, how can you possibly miss this, right?
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:55.220]   Unless you're just not paying attention at all.
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:40:00.260]   And if you are paying attention, you're looking for this, how can that not affect you, right?
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:04.860]   If you really believe that this devastation is coming upon mankind, and then just kind
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:10.300]   of like, "Oh, yeah, I learned some stuff in Revelation, and I'm just going to go back
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:16.220]   to my normal life and then just save money and retire and die," right?
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:21.300]   Either you believe this, and then you live according to the knowledge of what is coming
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:28.100]   and to live soberly, knowing that this world is going to pass, or you don't believe it,
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:29.500]   but there's nothing in between.
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:33.820]   You can't read this and believe this, and then just kind of live like everybody else.
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.540]   There is nothing in between, right?
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:39.420]   And it is not me, it is not the church, it is not our generation.
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:43.500]   The truth that we profess requires it, right?
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:48.860]   The gospel of Jesus Christ requires us to make a commitment, not to just tag along,
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:59.980]   but to make a commitment, right?
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:03.580]   The three woes, the warning of the severity of the three remaining judgments that is about
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:06.820]   to be unleashed in the second half of the trumpets blowing.
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.820]   So we'll get to that next week.
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:15.260]   And then let me go over the questions with you real quick.
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.260]   Discussion questions.
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.860]   Do you think that non-Christians in our area?
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:24.060]   Okay, and again, not world, because we don't know, but in particular where we live, in
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:29.140]   our area, know that the Bible teaches an intense end-time judgment for those who do not believe,
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.220]   right?
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:37.900]   So when you talk to non-Christians, do they know that the scripture, the God of love that
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:43.140]   is constantly being presented to the world, that do you think that they know that judgment
[00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:48.500]   is coming and just the intensity of this judgment, right?
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:55.580]   And these are, all of this, as horrific as these are, these are warnings, right?
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:56.580]   These are warnings.
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.180]   This is not the final judgment.
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:06.940]   All of these things are a warning to, hopefully, some might turn from their sins and not go
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:09.620]   to hell, right?
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.100]   Because the final judgment is not this.
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.460]   What you are seeing in this is not the final judgment.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:18.100]   The final judgment is when this is all over and the great white throne judgment comes,
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:21.860]   and then the other side of that is the real judgment for eternity.
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:24.460]   So as devastating as this is, this is not the end.
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.600]   This is actually a warning, right?
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:33.060]   So do you think that the non-Christians around us understand and know this, right?
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.900]   And let me say this.
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:39.360]   I think, humanly speaking, we think this is going to turn people off.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:46.100]   So in our wisdom, in our compassion, we think we're doing them a favor by not emphasizing
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:49.380]   this, because I know how they're going to respond.
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.460]   If you do that, you're playing God.
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:56.980]   You're basically telling God that the information you've given is going to scare people.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.080]   It's not going to save them.
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:03.900]   What God has revealed to us to save mankind, I'm going to take some of this off, because
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:09.780]   clearly you don't know what I know.
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:14.920]   Think how arrogant that is to present the gospel that was presented to us in this way,
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:19.060]   to cut some of this off and saying, "God, you don't know my friends.
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.780]   You don't know these people."
[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:25.740]   So it is beyond presumptuous, arrogant, for us to leave any part of this out.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:30.140]   I'm not saying that we go out and all we're doing is preaching judgment, but if we're
[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:34.740]   going to declare the clear gospel, you have to present the whole gospel.
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:39.220]   If we're going to say that Jesus is going to save us, you have to tell them what he's
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:40.660]   going to save us from.
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:43.780]   This is what he's saving us from.
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:48.460]   Two, should we interpret all natural disasters today as God's judgment?
[00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:49.460]   Why or why not?
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.660]   Try to explain from scripture, if possible.
[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:54.420]   Anytime there's a big disaster that happens, that becomes a big debate.
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.240]   Was that God or was that not God?
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.880]   So try to use scripture as much as possible.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:05.360]   Three, take some time to pray for the non-Christians in your life that God would open their eyes
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.520]   and be delivered from the wrath to come.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.260]   I think that's the immediate application.
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:11.640]   I think we talked about that last week.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:15.280]   If you knew that this was going to happen, if you were the first century Christian and
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:20.120]   you read this and there's a real possibility that this may happen, how would you respond?
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:23.720]   I think a lot of you responded by evangelism.
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.080]   That would be the, whatever it is that you're doing, wouldn't seem as important as telling
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.920]   other people about it.
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:32.560]   So let's take some time to think about the non-Christians in our lives, the people that
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.200]   we know, maybe not know, and be intentional about sharing the gospel with them.
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.880]   Take some time to pray before we end.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:48.560]   All right, let me pray first and then I'll let you guys get to your small group.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:54.600]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your living word.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:59.920]   We thank you that you've opened our eyes to see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:04.920]   Help us to be humble, to receive all that you have, that more than simply wanting to
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:11.240]   do the right thing, help us, Lord, to hunger and thirst for you, and that our desire to
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:16.560]   honor you, to glorify you, to worship you would lead to a clear understanding of all
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.280]   that you are doing in history.
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:23.840]   Help us, Lord God, to love you and to love our neighbors as ourselves, that that would
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:29.440]   be our greatest passion, greatest investment, and greatest energy and money spent, Father
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.880]   God, for that sake.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.080]   And so for that end, we pray for your blessing.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.800]   We pray for all the small group time, Lord, that you would bless that time as well.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.440]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
