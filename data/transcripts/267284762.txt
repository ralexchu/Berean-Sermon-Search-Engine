[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles to Romans chapter 13, we're going to be reading
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.960]   verse 8 through 10.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.880]   Romans chapter 13, verse 8 through 10.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.880]   Reading out of the ESV.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.600]   "Oh, no one, anything except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.120]   the law.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.320]   For the commandments, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.120]   not steal, you shall not covet, and any other commandments are summed up in this word.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.160]   You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.240]   Love does no wrong to a neighbor, therefore love is fulfilling the law."
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.840]   Let's pray.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.840]   Gracious Father, we thank you for this morning and for the privilege that we have to have
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.920]   access to the throne of grace.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.560]   We come before you with confidence, not by our own righteousness, but by the blood of
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.940]   Christ.
[00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.780]   We thank you for hearing our prayers.
[00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.780]   We thank you for allowing us, Lord God, access to you.
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.120]   We thank you for caring enough to send in your only begotten Son.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:11.000]   I pray that that truth would always renew us, strengthen us, compel us, help us to be
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.120]   hearers and doers of your word this morning.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   As you guys know, our church has many weddings.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.960]   We again want to congratulate Mr. and Mrs. Chang, Ryan and Kate that got married yesterday.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:34.400]   So let's say congratulations to them.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.360]   Again anytime a young couple gets married, it's a great time of celebration and it's
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.700]   great to have the church gathered together.
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.520]   But along with that, there's always a concern that our non-married singles will look at
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.080]   that and just look in envy and just wanting maybe, "When am I going to get to that stage
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.720]   and waste our singleness?"
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.000]   There is a lot of things in singleness that even some of the married people may look with
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.520]   fond memory.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.400]   And I was thinking about all the benefits of being single.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.800]   Obviously, the freedom.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.600]   You have freedom that the married people do not have.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.360]   You get convicted by a sermon, you can do it.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.360]   Married people have to go and have a discussion.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.760]   Is this even possible?
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.600]   You may look at a brochure, somebody's taking a trip and you say, "Oh, that'd be nice."
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.880]   Married people have the same desires, but that's where it ends.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.000]   You definitely have more money.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.560]   Married people have a lot more responsibility.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.760]   There's things that we need to take care of, bills that we need to pay.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.000]   Not that you don't have bills, but you have a bit more freedom to travel.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.120]   Even as a Christian, you want to go to short-term missions and do various things.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.720]   There's a lot of things that you can do.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.480]   In fact, being married requires a lot of sacrifice.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.840]   You have to share space.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.240]   You have to share your money.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.560]   You have to share your bed.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.520]   And you can't just decide, "Oh, I want to eat this."
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.520]   You have to make sure that the other person wants to eat it too.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.280]   And a lot of discussions, a lot of sacrifices go into being married.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.000]   Esther and I, every once in a while we'll have a conversation and she knows that if
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.640]   I didn't have the family responsibility, I would probably live in a trailer, buy a little
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.040]   motorcycle and just be free.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.820]   So why would anybody get married with all the benefits of being single and all the sacrifices
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.840]   that go into being married?
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.000]   Why would anybody in their right mind choose to partner up with somebody and make all those
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.920]   sacrifices?
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.360]   The answer is pretty clear, because you want to.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.360]   Nobody twists your arm.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.040]   There's not a biblical obligation that if you want to have a good follower of Christ
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.920]   that you need to find somebody and sacrifice and this is where we learn to pick up our
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.660]   cross, right?
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.720]   You just do it because you want to.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.040]   And there's only one reason why anybody would make that choice, because you fall in love
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.680]   with somebody and you choose to share your life with somebody.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.120]   I chose to get married because I'd rather be with Esther and I'd rather be with my children
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.960]   than doing all this other stuff and it was more than worth sacrificing to do that.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.360]   So there's only one reason why you would do that.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.240]   So a marriage without love, all it is is obligations.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.980]   All it is is sacrifice.
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.360]   And that is no different with our walk with God.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:41.800]   If all it is in our relationship is just obligations, then Christianity is one of the biggest burdens
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.280]   of any human being.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.120]   It's hard enough as it is to live a normal life just like everybody else in this world
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.480]   struggles and suffers.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.520]   But if love isn't what's compelling you, if love isn't the reason why God is drawing you
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.840]   to himself, then all it is is picking up your cross and sacrificing and denying yourself.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.040]   And that's what it feels like for a lot of Christians, for a lot of people who are attending
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.120]   church and you feel obligated.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.880]   And a lot of times, I mean, if love isn't what's compelling you, what is compelling
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.280]   you?
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.580]   Sometimes it's habit.
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.460]   Sometimes it's superstition.
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.280]   A lot of times it's because of the peer pressure of friends.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.400]   You just happen to be raised in a Christian home and you don't want to disappoint your
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.380]   parents and all your friends happen to be at church, so if you don't behave a certain
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.920]   way and sacrifice and do certain things, that because you want to fit in, you're willing
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.400]   to make sacrifices and do all of these things.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.200]   But Christianity without love is no different than marriage, with marriage vow with just
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.360]   obligations.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:54.080]   That's why Apostle Paul for 11 chapters has been describing this love that God has given
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.080]   us.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.080]   11 chapters.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.440]   When we talk about justification, you know, we think about it in theological terms of
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.040]   what Christ has done, that our sins have been justified, that now we have free access to
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.800]   God and all of these things are theological things, but if you take a step back and to
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.040]   summarize what justification is, justification is simply God's expression of His love toward
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.040]   us.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:24.360]   So 11 chapters, He's been expounding this unconditional love that He targeted us, sinners.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.640]   And it's in response to that in chapter 12, He says, "In view of this mercy, in view of
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.840]   this love, to live your life in sacrifice to God."
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.000]   And that's why He starts in verse 2 by saying that the correct response to the love of God
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.420]   that He has shown us is to renew our minds, not to be conformed to this world, but be
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.640]   transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.840]   So that at the core of the renewing of our mind is our understanding of love and the
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.160]   world's understanding of love.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.040]   So the world's understanding of love is ultimately is self-centered love.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:04.520]   How we practice love is based upon who helps me to advance my cause, who helps me to become
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:10.040]   more elevated, who advances my cause, who enhances my pride.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:16.160]   But He says our mind has to be renewed, completely renewed in order not to conform to this world,
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.240]   but be transformed and begin to think and to believe and to practice what God has practiced.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:29.520]   And so if you look at the brief outline, in application of God's mercy, He says in chapter
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:37.240]   12, verse 3 to 8, that we are to use our gifts in the church to glorify God, not ourselves.
[00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.980]   Chapter 12, verse 9 through 13, it says, "It teaches us how to deal with our brothers and
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.840]   sisters in Christ in this agape love."
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.920]   In verse 14 to 21, it deals with how to practice this biblical love with those who persecute
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.000]   us and who we consider to be harmful to us.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.880]   And then chapter 13, 1 through 7, last week, we talked about how that love is to be expressed
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.040]   for those who are in authority, for government.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.720]   Today in verse 8 to 10, He's not done with this discussion, but He pretty much summarizes
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.300]   what He has to say in these two verses.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.400]   And in these two verses, I want to just break it up into three parts just to help us in
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.680]   understanding of the three affirmations of this biblical love in conclusion.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.600]   Again, He has other things to say, but He kind of wraps up His argument in these two
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.420]   verses, and that's what we want to look at this morning.
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:32.840]   So the first thing we want to look at when He says in verse 8, "Owe no one anything except
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.440]   to love."
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.920]   Number one, love ultimately is an unpaid debt.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.880]   It is an unpaid debt.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.600]   So much of our frustration in life, from relationship to relationship, from job to job, sometimes
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:58.520]   from church to church, is when people disappoint us because we somehow think that people owe
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.520]   us something.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:05.600]   See, there's a fundamental change in what Paul is saying in this text where he says,
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:11.640]   we are all in one way or another debtors if we're Christians.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.800]   Years ago, Pastor John Piper wrote a book called Future Grace, and in that book, it
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:21.480]   says that God does not want us to live in debtor's ethic, meaning that we are not to
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.640]   live in a way that we're trying to pay God back, and he's absolutely correct.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:31.080]   How can we possibly pay back an infinite God who's given us an infinite love?
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:37.360]   So the idea of somehow we're going to appease God and to live to pay what God has done for
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.560]   us, it would bring us right back to the trap of the law.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:48.480]   What Paul is saying here is not to live as if to pay back the debt that He has given
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.840]   us, He paid for us.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:56.600]   He's saying that every Christian, every Christian has a debt that we owe to God that we cannot
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.240]   possibly pay.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:04.240]   And so therefore, it changes our fundamental attitude toward the way that we look at the
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.180]   world.
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:14.080]   If you remember in Romans chapter 1, Paul says in verse 14 and 15, "I am under obligation
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.940]   both to Greeks and to the barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish."
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.920]   Why is Paul obligated to the Jews?
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.900]   What did the Jews do?
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:29.160]   Other than every synagogue that he went, they wanted to stone him and drag him out and kill
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.160]   him.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.360]   Why does he say he's obligated?
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.920]   What did the Gentiles ever do for him?
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.920]   Every marketplace that he went to, there were a few Greeks who were converted, but for the
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:44.120]   most part, the majority of them wanted him stoned and killed.
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:50.920]   And yet he begins the book of Romans by saying he's obligated to the Greeks and to the barbarians.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:56.600]   Now obviously he's not saying that he's obligated because they've done something for him.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.840]   He's saying he's obligated in light of what God has done for him.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:07.200]   He's obligated not to them, but to God, and his expression of obligation to them is an
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:12.640]   expression of love in response to what God has done for him.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.140]   He's changing fundamentally his outlook in life.
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.040]   And that's the beginning of our walk with God as Christians.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.600]   If we walk to relationship with relationship looking for what that person's going to do
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:28.360]   for me, at some point you're going to be disappointed because they're not going to meet your sinful
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.360]   needs.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:35.920]   No selfish person will ever be satisfied with another person's selfishness.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.760]   At some point it will be expressed.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.660]   Their selfishness is going to conflict with your selfishness, and eventually that conflict
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.860]   is not going to be resolved.
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:51.560]   As a Christian, our fundamental outlook of life changes when we meet Christ.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.840]   Because we won the spiritual lottery.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:59.240]   We've been the focus of a love that we can possibly even imagine.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:05.160]   No matter how much I try to describe this love, it will never do it justice.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:10.400]   In fact the more you study the Bible, the more we are all, but just how deep this love
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.240]   is.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.240]   And so fundamentally we are changed.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.240]   That's what Paul is describing.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:21.600]   And he says, "Do not owe anybody anything except for this depth of love."
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.360]   When you recognize what it is.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:29.360]   Remember Sir Isaac Watts wrote this hymn, and I know many of you know this hymn.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.000]   And you probably sang it many times, you know bits and pieces, but I want to go over what
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.660]   he's saying with you, especially the last part of it.
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:41.120]   When he basically is describing for us the gospel truth, what every Christian confesses
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.600]   at its core.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.480]   When I survey the wondrous cross, on which the Prince of Glory died,
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:53.400]   My richest gain I count but loss, and poor contempt and all my pride.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.120]   Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast and save in the death of Christ my God
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.940]   All the vain things that charm me most, I sacrifice them to his blood.
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.760]   See from his head, his hands, his feet, sorrow and love flow mingle down,
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.600]   Did ever such love and sorrow meet, or thorns compose so rich a crown?
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.040]   For the whole realm of nature mine that were present far too small.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:20.720]   Basically all this that he's saying here is basically a summary of Romans chapter 1 through 11.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:26.920]   When he surveys the cross, this wondrous cross, how all that God has done,
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:32.160]   in light of all that God has done, everything that I have, my pride, my life, all of it,
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.900]   becomes rubbish.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:43.120]   And in conclusion he says, love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:49.420]   Can you imagine what fellowship would look like if everybody who's been affected by the
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:57.260]   love of Christ comes into the room thinking, "How can I pay this debt?"
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:06.140]   Considering what God has done, I owe, I owe my brothers, I owe my sisters, I owe this world.
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:11.500]   I have a debt that I cannot possibly begin to imagine to pay.
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:18.100]   Can you imagine the community how it would change if the Christians lived with this ethics?
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:22.220]   To owe nothing but this debt of love.
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.620]   That's what Paul is referring to.
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:28.980]   Again, this does not mean that Paul is calling us to pay back what we owe,
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.300]   because that's not possible.
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.740]   But he's saying that if we love God, the way we express our love for God is to express
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.980]   our love for our brothers and sisters.
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:45.740]   Ask any parent who has multiple children, "How can I help you?"
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:50.220]   Because so much of a parent's attention is to take care of the children, the best thing
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.000]   that anybody can do is to help us with our kids.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.780]   So if my oldest child comes to me and says, "Dad, what can I do for your birthday?"
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:01.220]   Usually, mom and dad, the first thing that we may say is, "Take care of your brother
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.540]   and sister.
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.340]   Take care of your siblings.
[00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:06.680]   That's the best way to help me.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.060]   That's the best way to love me."
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.300]   And God is basically telling us the same thing.
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.860]   If you love me, take care of my kids.
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.580]   First John chapter 4, 20 to 21, it says, "If anyone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother,
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:21.940]   he is a liar."
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.100]   He does not mix words.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:27.900]   "For he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:28.900]   seen.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:33.700]   And this commandment we have found from him, whoever loves God must also love his brother."
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:41.820]   How many of you have met somebody who's no longer going to church who said to you, "You
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:42.820]   know what?
[00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:43.820]   I love God.
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.140]   I love everything about who Jesus is.
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:50.260]   I love the gospel, but I hate the church.
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.340]   I love about what he has done.
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.100]   I love what Jesus stands for.
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:59.540]   I love who he is, but I can't stand the church."
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.940]   The scripture says it is not possible to do one with the other because God does not separate
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.540]   himself from the church.
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.900]   He says the church is the body of Christ.
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:12.380]   He says, "If you love me, you must love your brothers and sisters in Christ."
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.660]   You know the passage in John chapter 21, verse 17.
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:21.820]   Remember, after Peter denies Christ and after the resurrection, Jesus meets him at the shore
[00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:27.500]   of the Sea of Galilee and he asks Peter to restore him back.
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.500]   "Do you love me more than these?"
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.180]   If you read the commentaries, there's a lot of different discussions.
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.540]   What does Jesus mean here by these?
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:40.900]   And I've heard some commentaries talking about how these are talking about the fish, you
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.900]   know, because they were just fishing and said, "Jesus was pointing to the fish and, 'Do
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.460]   you love me more than these?'"
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.100]   Referring to, "Do you love me more than your previous life?
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:54.460]   Do you love me more than, you know, what you have outside of me?"
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.860]   I don't think it's that complicated.
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:02.420]   I think he's referring back to what Peter said before Jesus went to the cross when Jesus
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.420]   told him that he was going.
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.800]   He said, "Everybody's going to deny you but not me.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:13.540]   These other disciples, these other guys, they're weak but not me.
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.540]   I'm going to prove my love to you.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.820]   Even if they all fall, I won't fall."
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:23.540]   I think Jesus was probably pointing to the other disciples, referring back to his confession,
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.540]   his confidence.
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:25.940]   "Do you love me?
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.020]   Do you truly love me more than these?"
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.780]   Now this is the confidence that he had before, you know, now that he's actually failed, he's
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.380]   on this other side, he's asking him, "Do you really love me more than these?"
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.580]   Peter's affection for Jesus didn't change.
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:46.820]   I think Peter genuinely loved Christ before and he genuinely loved Christ after.
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.740]   But this is a humbled version of Peter.
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:55.060]   Jesus doesn't say, "Well, if you love me, don't do this.
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.180]   Don't do it again.
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:01.540]   If you really love me, next time anything like this happens, you better not deny me."
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:02.540]   He doesn't say that.
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.860]   Remember what he says?
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:09.020]   "If you really love me more than these, if you really love me," what does he say?
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.180]   "Feed my sheep.
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.400]   Feed my sheep.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.620]   If you want to worship me, if you want to follow me, if you want to genuinely love me,"
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.700]   he said, "love the ones that I love."
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.380]   He says, "Feed my sheep."
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:30.540]   It is no different for us if we confess our love for Christ and we hate our brothers.
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.480]   That's hypocrisy.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.280]   You can't love God and hate your brothers.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.740]   And that's basically what he's saying.
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.180]   That's what Paul is saying.
[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:44.540]   He says, "Owe nothing except for the debt of love."
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:49.860]   That every single one of us, every time, any group that we go to, that you don't owe me
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.200]   anything.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.700]   God has given me everything that I need for life and godliness.
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.700]   Everything.
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.580]   It's great to have your love, but I don't need it.
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.860]   It's great to have your support, but I don't need it.
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.420]   It's great to have accountability.
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.380]   It's great to be able to run the race together with other Christians.
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.020]   All of these things are great, but I don't need it.
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.940]   Everything I need has been given to me in Christ.
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:19.140]   So can you imagine how that would affect the church if every single person coming to church
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:24.700]   every time we're gathered together have this attitude that, "Owe nothing except for the
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:28.880]   debt of love," because of what God has done.
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:37.320]   So first and foremost, our recognition of this love is at the foundation of who we are.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.560]   And without that love is no different than a loveless marriage.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.880]   It's just sacrifice.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.920]   It's just religiousness.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.280]   It's just superstition.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:54.200]   Secondly, not only are we to have this attitude, he says love actually fulfills all the commandments.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.200]   Love is the fulfillment of all the commandments.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.400]   But in order to understand this, we have to understand it in context with what Jesus is
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.520]   saying.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:08.680]   Because I've heard some people apply this by saying, "Well, if we love, we don't need
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:13.360]   to obey any kind of commandments because love basically ended the commandments.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.360]   We don't need to.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.440]   So all we need to do is love Jesus and love one another."
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:22.200]   So all this talk about sanctification and holiness, that's against scripture because
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.520]   now the Bible says love fulfilled all of it.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.960]   Remember what Jesus says in Matthew 5, 17 when the Jews were accusing him?
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.400]   "This guy is against our law.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.320]   He's not obeying anything."
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.320]   Not that he wasn't obeying.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.160]   He wasn't obeying their tradition.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.680]   And Jesus corrects them by saying, "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.760]   or the prophets.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.560]   I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them."
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:51.840]   So we have to understand a distinction between abolishing the law and fulfilling the law.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:57.760]   The word that he uses here to fulfill is plereo.
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.280]   And basically the word doesn't mean to terminate or to end.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.240]   It means to fill up something that is hollow.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.040]   And that's the word that is used in Ephesians chapter 5, 8 when it says to be filled with
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:15.780]   the Holy Spirit is to have the Spirit of God consume us so that we are influenced by the
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.900]   Holy Spirit in everything that we do and say.
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:25.720]   So when he says the love fulfills the law, basically he's saying it is love that fills
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:31.960]   us up to be able to carry out the law, what God intended.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.600]   Let me give you a perfect example of that in the book of Isaiah.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.640]   You know, we study through the book of Isaiah chapter 1 and one of the harshest indictments
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:44.600]   against the nation of Israel happens right before they go into captivity.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.320]   The Babylonians are going to come, the Syrians are going to come and take them into captivity
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.960]   and he describes the reason why this is happening.
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:56.720]   In Isaiah chapter 1 verses 11 through 17 he says, "What to me is a multitude of your sacrifices,"
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.920]   says the Lord, "I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:01.920]   beasts.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.520]   I do not delight in the blood of bulls or of lambs or of goats."
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.440]   Let me stop right here.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:11.320]   Those of you who have been studying through the book of Leviticus, right, why were they
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:17.040]   giving these sacrifices?
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.480]   Why were they giving these sacrifices?
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.240]   Why were they giving many of these sacrifices?
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:27.840]   Is anything mentioned here in chapter 11 that God himself did not explicitly command?
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.520]   So why does God say he's tired of them?
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.520]   There's nothing mentioned here about idolatry.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.740]   There's nothing mentioned here about sexual impurity.
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:37.980]   He doesn't mention anything.
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:42.120]   Everything he mentions here are the things that are explicitly commanded in the book
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.120]   of Leviticus.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.720]   In fact, if they didn't do it correctly, they got killed.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.200]   And so God here says, "I'm tired of them."
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.480]   So did he change his mind?
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.840]   Did God's economy change that at one point this is what he wanted, and now he changed
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.960]   his mind, and they didn't really know him?
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.960]   He goes on further.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.180]   He says, "When you come to appear before me, who has required of you this trampling
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.360]   of my courts?"
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.000]   Who told them to come to the courts?
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   God did.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   The whole purpose of the tabernacle is that through these sacrifices that they were to
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.480]   come to the tabernacle.
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.000]   And yet he says, "Who told you to come?
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.840]   Who told you to come and trample my court?"
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:25.440]   Verse 13, "Bring no more vain offerings, incenses, and abomination to me."
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.040]   Remember what it says in the book of Leviticus over and over again?
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.080]   What do these incense...
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.280]   How did the Bible describe these incense?
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.560]   A pleasing aroma?
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:41.240]   These burnt sacrifices, these incense that they burned repeatedly over and over again
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:47.280]   was a pleasing aroma to God, and yet he says, "This incense is an abomination to me, new
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.600]   moon and Sabbath calling of convocation.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.720]   I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly."
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:58.640]   Every single thing that is mentioned here, verse 11 through 13, was commanded by God.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:03.960]   And to do this repeatedly, the burnt offering was to be given morning and night by the commandment
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.160]   of God.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.360]   The fire never was quenched.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:11.480]   Once he lit the fire, it was always going.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.480]   Sacrifice was always going.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:17.440]   And he says, "Why do you bring these empty sacrifices?
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.720]   When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.940]   Even though you make many prayers, I will not listen.
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.680]   Your hands are full of blood."
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:31.060]   The whole purpose of the tabernacle, the sacrifices, the burning of incense was so that they can
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:32.600]   draw near to him.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:38.120]   And God says, "My house will be called a house of prayer."
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.240]   And he says, "But now you come to me, I will not listen."
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.240]   Why?
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.880]   Did he change his mind?
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:50.760]   Is God's salvation plan different at this part of Israel's history than it was when
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.760]   he began?
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:56.880]   See, the reason why God was so angry with the nation of Israel was because God's whole
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:04.160]   reason why he told them to make these sacrifices wasn't because he was a connoisseur of barbecue.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:10.080]   It wasn't because he loved the smell of burnt animals, or he liked to see candles being
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:15.440]   burned, or he is an extrovert so he likes the assembly of his people together, that
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.840]   somehow he finds satisfaction in that.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.200]   Look what he says.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:25.320]   "Wash yourself, make yourself clean, remove the evil from your deeds from before my eyes,
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:31.480]   cease to do evil, learn to do good, seek justice, correct oppression, bring justice to the fatherless,
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.400]   plead the widow's cause."
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.080]   In other words, what is he saying?
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:40.400]   Practice love.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.920]   It wasn't about the animals.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.080]   It wasn't about the candles.
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.360]   There's no power in these things.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.580]   What he wanted was an expression of love.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.520]   So if you don't practice love outside the temple and then you bring it into the temple
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.400]   thinking that if you give many sacrifices that somehow that will appease the anger of
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.480]   God, you got it completely wrong.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:08.120]   God was not seeking to see if you just kill a lot of animals that he's going to be satisfied.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:12.560]   If you just stick to this, just do exactly what I tell you to do, and just gather together
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:17.920]   when I tell you to gather together, that somehow is going to appease his anger.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:25.200]   He was angry that they thought that somehow that killing these animals would somehow appease
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.760]   God.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.760]   The New Testament version of that, we see it at the church of Ephesus in Revelation
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:31.760]   chapter 2.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.440]   He says, "I know your works, your toil, your patient endurance, and how you cannot
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.560]   bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.080]   not and found them to be false."
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:49.560]   On the surface, every part of this church is exactly what a church should be doing.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:55.880]   Right doctrine, patient endurance, having the right leaders.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.280]   All of these things are things that are commanded in the scripture.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.560]   And he says in verse 3, "I know you're enduring patiently and bearing up for my name's sake,
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:07.880]   and you have not grown weary, but I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.320]   you had at first.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.940]   You're forsaken your first love."
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:17.960]   This was such a serious problem that he says that if you do not restore your first love,
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.480]   I will take away my lampstand.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.560]   And lampstand in chapter 1 basically is referring to the church itself.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:28.520]   So when he says if you don't restore your first love, to take away the lampstand basically
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.200]   means that God's presence is going to be withdrawn.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.720]   Your worship is going to be meaningless.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.800]   Your gathering would be meaningless.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.960]   Your sacrifice would be meaningless.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.600]   It is not the many times that we come to church.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:48.080]   And again, that's a danger of being in a church and growing up in a church where we think
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.660]   that because of our many Sundays that we're gathered together, that we're better off than
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.320]   everybody else.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:59.040]   That because we made the sacrifices, because we serve the church, because majority of the
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.560]   people around you probably do less than you.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:03.560]   And I'm not talking about non-Christians.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:10.880]   I'm probably, probably among even your Christian friends, you study the Bible more than most
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.280]   of the Christians that you know.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.200]   You're more active at the church more than most of the Christian friends that you probably
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.200]   know.
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.200]   That's my guess.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.920]   It may not be true for everybody, but for most of you.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:29.480]   Because of that, we can naturally think that God is more pleased with me than anybody else.
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:36.880]   He said, but true worship, true worship and true sacrifice ultimately is a fulfillment
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.040]   of this law of love.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.120]   And that's why he says to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength.
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.720]   Love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.920]   That is what fills up.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.960]   That is what God desires.
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.760]   So it wasn't just the burnt animals.
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.380]   It wasn't just the sacrifices.
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:55.840]   It wasn't just cleaning of the church and giving of the church.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:02.880]   All of these things are external expressions, but if it is not done in love, it means nothing.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.400]   We're guilty of the same thing that Israel was guilty of and guilty of the same thing
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.200]   that the church of Ephesus was guilty of.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.160]   That ultimately what God desires is love expressed through giving.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.480]   Love expressed through worship.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:21.280]   Love expressed through service.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.560]   Without love, it's just sacrifice.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.660]   It's just obligation.
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:31.840]   And eventually, we can't stand up under that for too long.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:37.280]   Third and finally, love ultimately does no harm to its neighbors.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:42.760]   And so he says in verse 9 and 10, he says, "For the commandment, 'You shall not commit
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.000]   adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet,' and other
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.200]   commandments are summed up in this word, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:56.300]   In 1 Peter 4, 8, Peter says, "Keep loving one another since love covers over a multitude
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.300]   of sins."
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:01.540]   So when he says love covers over a multitude of sins, he's not saying that if you commit
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:06.500]   certain sins but practice love that God will forgive you.
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.400]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:13.240]   Love is not an excuse to live in sin because somehow it balances each other out.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.240]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:22.360]   What he's saying is if you practice love, it's much easier to be gracious, to cover
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.360]   over sin.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.960]   Let's look at the practical application of this.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:34.240]   How does love, how does the fullness of love fulfill the commandment of not committing
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.240]   adultery?
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:41.000]   You know, people who fall into this temptation will sometimes say, "You know, I fell in love
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.860]   with somebody else."
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:47.240]   But when you take a closer look at what they're saying is they didn't fall in love with somebody
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:51.180]   else, it's lack of love that caused them to get into adultery.
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:55.820]   You know, a lot of times the way that we use the word love, we use it in a way that we
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:59.400]   describe, you know, loving fish, right?
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.840]   And let me describe what I mean by that.
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:08.440]   You know, we say we love fish and say, "Oh, what do you mean by that?"
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.520]   Because I love fish, I catch it, I kill it, and I cut it into small pieces and I put it
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:16.620]   in my mouth and I chew it and I eat it, right?
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.280]   That's what we mean by when we love fish.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.640]   A lot of times when we say we love something, that's what it means.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.100]   So it's not because we love fish.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:29.760]   If we really love fish, we will protect it, feed it, make sure the tank is clean, and
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:34.340]   that it lives a long and healthy, prosperous life, right?
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:38.740]   The Bible says that love is when a friend lays down his life and he gives everything
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.780]   for the sake of his friend.
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:44.140]   He said that's how love is described, when you're willing to sacrifice for the object
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.140]   of your love.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:49.500]   But oftentimes, the way that the world describes love, it's not love for it, it's love for
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.620]   yourself.
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:56.580]   I love the fish, I love you because you give me something.
[00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:03.100]   So he said adultery ultimately is an expression of selfish love.
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:09.940]   He says when we practice biblical love and we're filled with this love, it prevents us
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:10.940]   from adultery.
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:18.480]   It is lack of love for my wife or my children or the people around in my community that
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.940]   causes an individual to walk down this path.
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:24.720]   So that's what it means when he says love fulfills all the commandment, it fills it
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.500]   all up.
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.140]   And that's what ultimately God is intending.
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:32.180]   He's not saying that if you practice love, it doesn't matter if you commit adultery.
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.940]   That's not what he's saying, obviously.
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:40.780]   Without love, it's just self-control.
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:45.340]   You know, the best way to prevent adultery is love your wife.
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:49.040]   Love your wife passionately.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.560]   Commit to your wife.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:56.540]   And if you love your wife and your wife loves you, that's the greatest deterrent to adultery.
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:59.940]   How does love fill up the commandment not to murder?
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:05.820]   You know, murder ultimately is hatred that we give into.
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.980]   And then it bears fruit eventually into murder.
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:11.440]   Obviously, you know, majority of people that we know will not commit murder.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.820]   But Jesus says that if you have hatred toward your brother, it is like it because it is
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:19.140]   the root of love, the root of murder.
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.260]   If you have love, it's a lot easier to be patient.
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:27.780]   I mean, if we're driving down the road and somebody cuts us off and our immediate response
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:30.100]   is rage, how dare you?
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:33.380]   You know, I almost crashed my car.
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:37.580]   And then you drive up fast to see who did this to you and you look in and then you see
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:43.540]   it's one of your elders.
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:48.080]   Or me, I go up and then I look at it's one of our church members.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:55.880]   And you turn into, bless you, brother.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:01.180]   Our relationship, the kind of relationship that we have toward one another helps us to
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.320]   cover over multitude of sins.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:08.780]   Now somebody that you already had something against, they do something wrong, we're eager
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:09.780]   to share that.
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.340]   We're eager to highlight it.
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:14.900]   You know, we already had some animosity, a misunderstanding or something that you've
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:18.780]   never dealt with and all of a sudden they say something wrong, they do something wrong
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:23.780]   and you're so eager to spread it to everybody, let everybody know what they did wrong.
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.900]   Because the root of that relationship is not love.
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:32.580]   But if that was somebody that you really cared about, your brother, your sister, maybe your
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.320]   child.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.980]   I think every parent can directly relate to your child.
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:42.160]   If your child did something, you're not eager to go and spread that on Facebook.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:45.580]   You're not eager to go and tell everybody what he did.
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.380]   Because you love your kid.
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:52.980]   And you want to do the best that you can to help them.
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:53.980]   That's what he's saying.
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:35:00.820]   He said if love is not at the root, our natural response, we're eager to expose other people's
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.660]   sins.
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:07.980]   How does love fill up the commandment, "You shall not steal."
[00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:11.740]   You know, I worry about things getting stolen outside of the house, but inside of the house,
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.420]   because I love them, they love me.
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:18.460]   Typically people steal from people that they don't know.
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:23.140]   So again, all of these things, when it says love is the filling up, and even the commandment,
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:25.980]   "Thou shalt not covet."
[00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:29.860]   When something good happens, they get a raise or they get a job or they get into school
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:34.580]   that you wanted to go to, as much as on the outside we say, "Oh, congratulations, we feel
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:35.580]   good for you."
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:40.820]   But there's a part of us that kind of covets and say, "Why didn't that happen to me?"
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.860]   And it's, you know, we're supposed to rejoice with them, but we don't really rejoice with
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:47.180]   them because we covet what they have.
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:52.140]   Unless it happens to somebody we really love, we genuinely love and care for.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.580]   And when something good happens to them, we can rejoice with them.
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.420]   It's almost like we won.
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.780]   It's almost like we got in.
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:05.540]   You know, somebody asked me, because you know, a lot of you guys know I used to play a lot
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:07.580]   of basketball when I was younger.
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:14.320]   And then when my kids started playing basketball, and my dream was one day that we'd be good
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.280]   enough to play competitively together.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:21.320]   And I realized that I was tanking much faster than they were going up.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:25.900]   And so that line where we cross, where we can play competitively, may have been just
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.740]   a few hours.
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:32.280]   Because we changed hands so quickly.
[00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.120]   And then, you know, people would jokingly say, "Oh, you know, how do you feel?
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.240]   Your son beat you.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.640]   Your son can shoot better than you.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.400]   Your son could do this."
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.880]   And you would think that my response would be, "Oh my gosh, I feel horrible."
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.660]   You know?
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:48.340]   I want my kids to be better than me.
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:51.240]   I want my kids to be taller than me and better looking than me.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:57.000]   It feels good as a father because when good things happen to them, I feel good about it.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.760]   Ask any parent if they feel different.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:05.260]   If love is the base, it deals with coveting.
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.260]   It deals with adultery.
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:07.560]   It deals with murder.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.560]   It deals with stealing.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.280]   And he said that's what he means.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.840]   He said love is the filling up of the command.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:20.400]   Like every command that he gave us, ultimately, it wasn't just not committing adultery.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.120]   It's to love your wife.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.240]   It's not just not stealing.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.080]   You love and you want what's best for them.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.640]   It's not just not coveting.
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.480]   You want what's best for them.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.440]   And this is also true of the commandment for God.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:40.340]   "Thou shalt not have any other gods before me."
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:48.760]   If we don't love God, this temptation from the world is too great.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.360]   Because I mean, think about it.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:57.600]   Billions and billions of dollars are spent to get you to love what they're selling.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.880]   I mean, they dress it up and even the people in the magazine on the things that you watch
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.920]   and they're the most beautiful people that you've ever seen.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:09.800]   You get the top 1% of the universe and you put them on a magazine and they're selling
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.800]   something.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.940]   I mean, and you give yourself to that.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:15.160]   How do you just walk past that and say no?
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.800]   How often are you going to just say no to that?
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:24.400]   See, the first commandment to have no other gods before me is to gaze upon who he is.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:29.560]   And when you fall in love with God, everything else becomes rubbish.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:34.900]   You don't just say rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish and it disappears.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:40.400]   You gaze upon the beauty of God and the only thing that can compete, the only thing that
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:46.280]   can compete with the attraction of this world is the glory of God.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:53.100]   So when you fall in love with God, all these other things are a hindrance to this joy.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:57.800]   So love is the filling up of that commandment.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:04.000]   Thou shalt have no graven images of me to make him something that he's not and worship
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.200]   it to ultimately worship ourselves.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:14.720]   You know, when heresy and blasphemy things are being said and done in our culture, sometimes
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:20.840]   Christians respond with indifference as if it was something that's just disconnected.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:24.080]   You know, maybe these are things that the pastors should worry about or theologians
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.040]   should worry about.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.900]   That's because there's a disconnect in our affection for our God.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:35.020]   And I mentioned this to you before, years ago when that book came out, Dan Brown's book,
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:39.560]   you know, and he came out, the Da Vinci Code, basically he said Jesus had an extra marital
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:45.480]   affair with Mary and he had children out of wedlock and they were saying all this and
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:50.880]   then when they confronted him about his facts, all he said was, "Oh, it's just fiction."
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:54.200]   You know, some of it is true and some of it I made up, but it's just to sell books.
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.200]   It's just a fiction.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:00.840]   But what surprised me was how many Christians were entertained by this book.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:05.500]   And I remember having conversations with some Christians thinking, "This is your God that
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:13.200]   you worship who died for our sins that supposedly that we love and worship every single week.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:17.260]   Now what if I said that I'm entertaining an article, not a book, about how your mother
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.480]   is a whore?"
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.880]   I'm pretty sure all of us, you know, even just the fact that I said that made you feel
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:23.880]   uncomfortable.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:28.820]   And the reason why it made you feel uncomfortable is because you love your mom, your dad, or
[00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:29.820]   your kids.
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:34.160]   So even the thought of saying that makes you feel uncomfortable because you have affection
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.800]   for your mom.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:41.600]   And yet when it comes to the God that we worship, it's just so cerebral.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.080]   It's like, "Oh, okay, we should.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.080]   That's wrong.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:45.080]   We shouldn't be doing that.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.080]   But we're not outraged."
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:56.360]   See, when we love our God and we've seen the glory of who He is, all these things that
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:00.600]   He's, all these commandments are just an expression of this love.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:05.540]   That's why we, even the keeping the Sabbath holy, it's not about, "Oh, Sabbath, you know,
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.540]   we shouldn't do this.
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.540]   We shouldn't do that."
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:08.540]   Remember what Jesus said?
[00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:12.800]   "Man was not made for Sabbath, but Sabbath was," what?
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.740]   "Made for man."
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.740]   It was given to you as a gift.
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:22.640]   So the corporate worship of God is not a burden for us to come together and say, "Oh, I have
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.880]   to do this because I'm a Christian.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.200]   I have to go to church."
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:30.860]   He says, "No, the Sabbath was given to you to worship."
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:36.980]   But if love is not what fills us, if love is not what compels us, if love is not what
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:43.440]   moves us, yeah, that's exactly what it is, just an obligation, just a sacrifice, just
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.400]   a bunch of duties.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:49.900]   And eventually it gets old.
[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:59.240]   But when love is what fills us, it changes our fellowship, it changes our prayers, it
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:04.920]   changes our worship, it changes our gathering, it changes evangelism, and everything that
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.960]   God commands us, what does He say?
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.720]   "It is no longer a burden."
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.360]   This is where we find life.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.380]   We find life in obedience.
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:16.940]   We find life in worship.
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.020]   We find life in sacrifice.
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:23.680]   When love is what compels us.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:28.380]   That's why love is not a peripheral issue.
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.260]   Love is not one of many virtues.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:35.640]   It is the virtue of love, faith, and hope.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.860]   Consider faith is what saves us.
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.840]   Consider hope is why we are persevering.
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:43.660]   But even among all of that, he says, "Faith is the greatest."
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.720]   Because faith leads us to love.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.620]   Hope causes us to persevere to get to this love.
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.680]   Love is the core.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.840]   Love is our foundation.
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:52.960]   Love is the fuel.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.800]   And love is our goal.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:00.860]   And so that's how we evaluate everything that we do.
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.100]   How are you doing spiritually?
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:04.920]   We typically answer, "Oh, I did quiet time."
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.240]   Or, "I didn't do quiet time.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.480]   I memorized some verses.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:08.600]   I shared the gospel.
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.640]   I'm serving the church.
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.400]   I'm giving."
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.680]   You can do all of that without love.
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:18.200]   All of these things should only be an expression of that love.
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:21.520]   So when we ask ourself how you're doing, the number one thing that we should be asking
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:25.800]   ourselves is, "Where is my affection?
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.080]   Where is my affection?
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.080]   Do I love the Lord?
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:31.920]   Am I pursuing the Lord to love Him?
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:36.240]   And then is that love causing me to love my neighbors?"
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:42.640]   Let's take a few minutes to pray, again, as we ask our praise team to come back up.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.480]   And I want to encourage you.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:51.600]   There's some of us that are always struggling with discipline, like prayer, reading the
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:57.360]   Bible, and doing various things that we're supposed to do as Christians.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:03.720]   And I want you to take a step back and ask yourselves, "Why is prayer and the Word so
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:06.160]   difficult for you?
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:13.640]   Is it simply a matter of discipline, or you do not connect that with Christ?"
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.760]   That's not an avenue to pursue a loving relationship with Christ.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:20.280]   Maybe you don't have faith.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:27.320]   Maybe that's the reason why studying the Word of God and prayer is just an obligation,
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:30.840]   to take a step back and examine ourselves to see where we are.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:34.480]   Some of you are very good at discipline.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:38.680]   You've always been an A student, and you're so frustrated with other people who are just
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.920]   not jumping through the hoops as well as you are.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:48.520]   We need to take a step back and ask ourselves, "Is my focus love for God and loving others?"
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:52.840]   Why is it that every time somebody asks me how I'm doing, I'm only talking about how
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:56.200]   frustrated I am with other people?
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:45:00.320]   Not about His love, not about what He's done for me, not about the fact that you and I
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:03.680]   are debtors of this love.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:10.200]   And again, to take a step back and examine ourselves, where is our affection?
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.960]   Let's take a few minutes as our worship team leads us to really come before the Lord and
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.320]   ask the Lord, "We want to love you.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.360]   Help us."
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.360]   Let's take some time to pray as they lead us.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.280]   (thud)
