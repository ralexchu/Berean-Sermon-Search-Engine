[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.580]   - So good morning.
[00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.420]   So as I was preparing this message,
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.600]   a lot of people were asking,
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.600]   "I haven't seen you up there before.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.440]   "How long has it been since you've been,
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.600]   "have you ever preached on a Sunday?"
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.800]   Yes, the answer is yes, I have.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.800]   It was a very, very long time ago,
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.240]   probably before most of you came to our church,
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.240]   so that's why you've probably never seen me here.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.240]   It's back many years ago, before we even had two services,
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.740]   so that's how long ago.
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.740]   Interestingly enough, this Bible that I have
[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.240]   is very old and it's an NASB,
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.240]   so when our church transitioned to NASB, I pulled it out.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.240]   And as I was preparing this pulpit today, this morning,
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.240]   so the date, 2019, or January 19, 2020,
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.240]   in my Bible, I found a program from 2001.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.240]   So God gave me an illustration,
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.240]   at least in terms of our church was very different,
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.240]   probably just like this section right here, back then.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.240]   So it's been a long time,
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.240]   and this pulpit has been faithfully preaching God's word
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.240]   for decades now, and I've been a beneficiary of that,
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.240]   so I come to this place with privilege,
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.240]   with a privilege and blessing
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.240]   that the word of God has been faithfully preached
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.240]   through men here, especially Pastor Peter.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.240]   He's been doing this a long time,
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.240]   and I've been fortunate to sit under
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.240]   probably a thousand sermons, thinking through that.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.240]   So Pastor Peter Chung mentioned,
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.240]   as we were going through the covenants,
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.240]   the very practical nature of the covenant
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.240]   and the signing of that covenant by our members.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.240]   And he mentioned, and he kind of reiterated
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.240]   that we want our church to adhere
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.240]   to what Paul encourages Timothy,
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.240]   to watch our life and doctrine well.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.240]   So I get the privilege of getting to the very,
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.240]   very practical, your money, right?
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.240]   So let's jump into this covenant.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.240]   So it's, in covenant number eight says,
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.240]   "I commit to tithing and giving financially
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.240]   "in accordance with Christ's lordship over my life."
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.240]   Let me read that again.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.240]   "I commit to tithing and giving financially
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.240]   "in accordance with Christ's lordship over my life."
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.240]   So when we think about finances in general,
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.240]   we need to think rightly,
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.240]   and with the proper perspective.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.240]   Finances permeates every day, most days of our life,
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.240]   how we spend our money.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.240]   Maybe we eat out, maybe we're spending, paying bills.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.240]   Obviously those things are permeating
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.240]   through our day to day.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.240]   And how often are you self-reflecting
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.240]   or evaluating your thinking about finances and money
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.240]   and how you spend money, right?
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.240]   So unfortunately, we have heard in the church
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.240]   many stories of bad things, right?
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.240]   If you've been in the church, you know that
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.240]   we've heard the news over the years of theft,
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.240]   of embezzlement, of fraud,
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.240]   all of these things in the church.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.240]   So your initial reaction might be,
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.240]   as you give, where's my money going?
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.240]   Where's my money going?
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.240]   Is it being used properly?
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.240]   And those are things that we should be intentional about
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.240]   and we should be thorough about.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.240]   And as one of the elders,
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.240]   or the elder that handles our financials for our church,
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.240]   and for the most part, I'm very encouraged by our members
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.240]   that they adhere to this and give,
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.240]   and with intentionality.
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.240]   Not just because you signed a covenant to say,
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.240]   hey, I'm gonna tithe and give financially,
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.240]   'cause I signed it,
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.240]   but there's intentionality for the most part.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.240]   So in terms of this topic,
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.240]   there shouldn't be anything new about
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.240]   the idea of giving for God's kingdom and for his church, right?
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.240]   And this message is not trying to milk you
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.240]   for more money or anything like that,
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.240]   so that's not the goal.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.240]   If it ends up happening,
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.240]   then that was the spirit convicting you to give more, right?
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.240]   It's not me trying to milk you for that, okay?
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.240]   So what does the Bible say about money, right?
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.240]   As I was preparing this message,
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.240]   it came across, I was just overwhelmed.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.240]   Overwhelmed with how much the Bible talks about finances
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.240]   and attitudes towards money.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.240]   I can't do it in one message.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.240]   There's no way.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.240]   But I'm gonna try to touch upon some major points.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.240]   So if you flip the next slide, just the Gospels, okay?
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.240]   So as I was studying, as I was preparing,
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.240]   there's probably about 38 to 40 parables
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.240]   that Jesus gives in his ministry.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.240]   One out of three are talking about finances and money.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.240]   Let's go through this.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.240]   The hidden treasure, parable of the pearl of great price,
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.240]   the lost coin.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.240]   And you should kind of have an idea what these are about, right?
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.240]   The talents, easy one, the prodigal son and money, right?
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.240]   He blows the money.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.240]   The rich man and Lazarus.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.240]   Caesar's taxes.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.240]   The rich young ruler.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.240]   The laborers in the vineyard.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.240]   So there's many more, and that's just the Gospels, right?
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:02.240]   Money issues and money teaching is not ambiguous in Scripture.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.240]   So as I was thinking through this,
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.240]   the idea of what are the most sensitive areas of discussion
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.240]   when you talk to people?
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.240]   What are the things that people say don't talk about
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.240]   with other people?
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.240]   I Googled it, of course.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.240]   The three things not to discuss in polite company.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.240]   Number one, religion, right?
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.240]   You've heard of these, religion.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.240]   Number two, politics.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.240]   And number three, money.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.240]   So I get two of three that I get to talk about.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.240]   I would argue number two touches religion.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.240]   But we're not going to talk about politics, right?
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.240]   If you want to talk to me offline or away from the pulpit,
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.240]   I'll be happy to discuss those things with you.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.240]   But I get to touch upon this sensitive issue of don't talk about this
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.240]   with other people.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.240]   Money, religion, politics, all of these things.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.240]   So if you follow along with the outline,
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.240]   I'm going to give it up front as our pastors have been doing.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.240]   Number one, offerings and ties.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.240]   Number two, obligation versus free will, the idea of lordship.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.240]   And then the practical, the rubber meets the road.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.240]   So as I was speaking to our pastors and Pastor Mark and I had a discussion,
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.240]   I think last week, about topical messages.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.240]   Topical messages are difficult.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:33.240]   We both agree that there's so much material out there to try to get a topic addressed.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:39.240]   It's a lot easier sometimes to have a passage and dive into expository
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.240]   kind of exposition on that passage because you have a place to go.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.240]   You can look at the passage through all angles.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.240]   Topical is very big.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.240]   So what I said was, "Well, okay, I'm going to do this.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.240]   I'm going to exposit the covenant."
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:00.240]   It gives us a platform, at least for me, to jump off of.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.240]   So it's broken down into two sections.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.240]   I commit to tithing and giving financially in accordance with Christ's lordship
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.240]   over my life.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.240]   Personal commitment, I commit.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.240]   And built into that statement is the idea of motivation.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.240]   In accordance with the lordship of Christ.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.240]   So when we think about tithe, the Greek word is "masar," tenth.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.240]   Literally tenth.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.240]   So I looked up in the dictionary as well.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:34.240]   The dictionary definition of tithe is the tenth part of agricultural produce
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:40.240]   or personal income set apart as an offering to God or for works of mercy
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:46.240]   or the same amount regarded as an obligation or tax for the support of the church,
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.240]   priesthood or the like.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.240]   So when we put this into the covenant, well aware that the New Testament
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.240]   doesn't necessarily address tithe as the word, right?
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.240]   But the Old Testament required it.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.240]   It was required in the law.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.240]   So when we think as we go through the Old Testament,
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.240]   as we see that the tithe is ultimately a bare minimum of what the Old Testament
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.240]   believers were giving.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.240]   So what I wanted to do is kind of a brief case study through the Old Testament
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.240]   sacrificial system.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.240]   For those of you who were here during Leviticus study,
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.240]   we're going to touch upon some of the things you probably already learned.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:34.240]   But if you turn to Deuteronomy 12, 4 through 7,
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.240]   it's up there for your reading if you don't have your Bible
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:43.240]   or you can't get there fast enough.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.240]   And it says, "You shall not act like this."
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.240]   Okay, sorry, let me set this up.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.240]   The first few verses of this passage,
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.240]   he's talking about the comparison between idol worshipers and other nations.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:01.240]   So it picks up in verse 4, "You shall not act like this toward the Lord your God.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.240]   But you shall seek the Lord at the place which the Lord your God will choose
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:09.240]   from all your tribes to establish his name there for his dwelling.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.240]   And there you shall come.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:15.240]   There you shall bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes,
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.240]   the contribution of your hand, your votive offerings, your freewill offerings,
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.240]   and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.240]   There also you and your household shall eat before the Lord your God
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:31.240]   and rejoice in all your understandings in which the Lord your God has blessed you."
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:37.240]   So there was this requirement as they approached God,
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.240]   God required offerings.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.240]   So when were these offerings taken?
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.240]   Pretty much every gathering of the people of God, right?
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.240]   The festivals, the feasts, the announcements,
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.240]   they brought an offering before the Lord.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.240]   What sort of offering was required?
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.240]   Something, you can't come empty-handed, right?
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:05.240]   So you bring an animal, some grain, a drink offering.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.240]   The point is you don't come empty-handed before the Lord
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.240]   as you approach him in worship.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.240]   So what typical sacrifice dominated the Old Testament system?
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.240]   I found this chart or this graphic, the five offerings.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:26.240]   It's kind of a lot of there, a lot of things to read,
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.240]   the highlighted circles, right?
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.240]   The burnt offerings, sin offering, guilt or trespass,
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.240]   peace offering, meal offering.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.240]   But I want to kind of focus on the blood atoning offerings,
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.240]   the burnt offerings, the sin and guilt.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.240]   That was a gateway into appeasing God, right?
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.240]   That he's holy.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.240]   Those had to be addressed first.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.240]   And then we see the Thanksgiving and meal and picnic type of offerings, right?
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.240]   Where people would give out of Thanksgiving and appreciation,
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:03.240]   they would sit down with their families and have a meal together.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.240]   So how does this principle apply to us today?
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:13.240]   So the most important sacrifice has been done, accomplished for us, right?
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.240]   Hebrews 7.26 talks about that.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.240]   "For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest,
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.240]   holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.240]   and exalted above the heavens.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.240]   Who does not need daily like those high priests to offer up sacrifices,
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.240]   first for his own sins and then for the sins of the people?"
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:37.240]   Because this he did once for all when he offered up himself.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.240]   And for those of you who are going through the first John memory,
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.240]   and I'm so encouraged, side note,
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.240]   there's 100 people in our church going through this.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.240]   That's awesome.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.240]   But Chapter 2, he's atoning sacrifice for our sins,
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.240]   but not only for ours, but also for the whole world.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.240]   And that's the NIV version.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.240]   I've chosen to memorize the NIV version.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.240]   So we'll leave it at that.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:07.240]   So we're not required to bring an offering of an animal to shed blood
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.240]   and all that, like the Old Testament believers, right?
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:16.240]   But we have the privilege of bringing offerings of appreciation and thanksgiving.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.240]   We don't need the blood sacrifice anymore.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.240]   That's been atoned for.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:27.240]   But we have the privilege to still come and bring offerings of appreciation and thanksgiving.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.240]   So what is that offering?
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.240]   The New Testament's clear, right?
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.240]   That sacrifice and offering that we bring now is ourself.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.240]   That's what this Scripture teaches, right, in Romans 12, 1 and 2.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:47.240]   In light of the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ that Paul expounds for 11 chapters,
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:51.240]   Chapter 12, "Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God,
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:57.240]   to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God,
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.240]   which is your spiritual service of worship.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.240]   And do not be conformed to this world,
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.240]   but be transformed by the renewing of your mind
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:09.240]   so that you may prove what the will of God is,
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.240]   that which is good and acceptable and perfect."
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:19.240]   So the question is, what kind of offering sacrifice do you bring?
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:28.240]   What does presenting your bodies a living sacrifice mean when it comes to finances?
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:35.240]   So the obligation versus free will, the lordship side of this.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.240]   The expectation is your whole life, right?
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:42.240]   Romans 12 talks about that. It's your whole life.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:50.240]   Namely, as we think through the financial side of things, it's time and money, right?
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:57.240]   Pastor Nate last week touched upon this idea of do not forsake the meeting together
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.240]   and looking out for one another as he went through the one another's, right?
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:06.240]   All these aspects of looking out for the interests of others in time, right?
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:13.240]   That's where we can rubber meet the road in terms of how to apply that covenant.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:19.240]   As well in this aspect, we need to think of the resources and the finances side of things.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:26.240]   So let's kind of look through what we studied in Philippians chapter 4, verses 15 and 17.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:33.240]   "You yourselves also know, Philippians, that at the first preaching of the gospel after I left Macedonia,
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:38.240]   no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you alone.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:44.240]   For even in Thessalonica, you sent a gift more than once for my needs.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:51.240]   Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek for the profit which increases to your account."
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:58.240]   So giving allows us to profit an increase to our account.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:08.240]   In other words, we are the beneficiaries as we participate in giving, in participation of gospel ministry and work.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:15.240]   Acts 20, our brother Peter read that, "In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work,
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:20.240]   we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.240]   It is more blessed to give than to receive."
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:29.240]   The NIV talks about partnership and partnering, participation in the gospel.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:36.240]   So another thought came to my mind, "Are you gospel-centered?"
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:41.240]   So when I say gospel-centered, maybe you're thinking of other things.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:47.240]   Maybe gospel-centered isn't the normal kind of thought process of financial or resources.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.240]   Maybe it brings some baggage because there's a lot of things that gospel-centeredness brought about
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.240]   in the church.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.240]   But let's break it down. God-centered.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.240]   Is your aim in your life for gospel purposes?
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:09.240]   Does gospel-centeredness mean that the gospel is the goal? Of course it does.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.240]   So we talk about vision number one, right, at our church.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.240]   We want to give God-centered worship, not man-centered.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.240]   So what is God-centered worship then?
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.240]   Looking at everything through the prism of God, right?
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:26.240]   So when you think about God, what is God-centered about?
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.240]   Meaning God himself. He is gospel-centered.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:35.240]   God-centeredness is gospel-centeredness.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.240]   So everything needs to be applied.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:44.240]   If we're going to use that term to identify ourselves with that we want to be gospel-centered,
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.240]   we want to be God-centered. Everything has to go through that prism.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:54.240]   Your time and your finances as well.
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:00.240]   Philippians chapter 1, 3 through 5 says, "I thank my God in all my remembrance of you,
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.240]   always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for you all,
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:10.240]   in view of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now."
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:22.240]   For context, Paul is using the Philippians as a model in Macedonia to encourage the Corinthians.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:27.240]   If you look at 2 Corinthians chapter 8, he's referencing the Philippians.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:35.240]   "Now brethren, we wish to make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia,
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:43.240]   that in a great ordeal of affliction, their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:48.240]   For I testify that according to their ability and beyond their ability,
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:55.240]   they gave of their own accord, begging us with much urging for the favor of participation,"
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.240]   again that word, "in the support of the saints.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:06.240]   And this, not as we had expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God."
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.240]   What does that mean?
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:15.240]   So when we think about finances and resources, often we're thinking of investments,
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:27.240]   property investments, cash, credit cards, retirement planning, 401ks, mutual funds, index funds, Roth IRAs.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:34.240]   But how does that relate to covenant number one, where Pastor Mark went through,
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:43.240]   "I confess Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior."
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:50.240]   So when we think through the idea of practical illustrations, I want to give you one.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:55.240]   God was gracious to give me one in practical life.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:06.240]   So a few weeks back, as I was thinking through this, I was kind of living life, right?
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.240]   I left my house. I had two of my kids, CJ and Corbin, I think, with me.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.240]   We were going to Costco to get some gas.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:20.240]   So I left the house, and unfortunately, I left my wallet at home.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:26.240]   So as I'm driving, as I'm getting on the freeway, I'm like, "Oh no, I left my wallet at home."
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.240]   Not a big deal in my mind, because Costco, you could do everything through your phone.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.240]   So I wasn't going to turn back to get my wallet.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:43.240]   My second son, whose name is Corbin, he says, in response to my comment, "I left my wallet at home,"
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:52.240]   he's like, "Appa," which means "Daddy" in Korean, "money is very important."
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.240]   And I'm driving, and I heard that, and I was like, "Yeah, it is. It is important."
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:03.240]   I chuckled about it, but as I'm thinking about financials and what I'm going to address with the church,
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:08.240]   I was like, "That's so true. Money is very important."
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:15.240]   The Bible talks so much about money and our attitudes towards it.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:23.240]   Oh, and by the way, Corbin, if you don't know what Corbin means, it means "offering devoted to God."
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:27.240]   So interesting, and it didn't come from my first son, CJ, but Corbin.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:35.240]   So God ordained illustration, I believe.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:42.240]   So that thought came to me, more and more, the importance of money in light of Scripture.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.240]   And like I said, I can't do it justice.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:52.240]   These verses and these parables, we can sit down and go through all of them.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.240]   But what is the motivation to give?
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.240]   Is it an obligation?
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.240]   Is it just out of our own accord?
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:06.240]   Is it the mindset of the definition of tithe, right?
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.240]   He talks about taxes to the church.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.240]   I don't necessarily like that idea.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.240]   Who likes the idea of taxes?
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.240]   Is that the mindset we should have in terms of church?
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:21.240]   That I have to give because they're going to go after me then.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:26.240]   Not the civil government, but the church government's going to go after me.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.240]   Wrong attitude.
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:40.240]   Don't view giving to the church as a tax that you would pay your property taxes or income taxes.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.240]   It's gospel enterprise.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:47.240]   It's for the gospel to go forth and move forward.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:56.240]   Don't think I got to pay the minimum, as less as possible, to not get into trouble.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   Wrong attitude and perspective.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:07.240]   2 Corinthians 9, 6 says, "Now this I say, he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly,
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:12.240]   and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully."
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:18.240]   Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:25.240]   Not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.240]   We've heard that.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:33.240]   We've heard offering prayers about desiring to be, having an attitude of cheerfulness.
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.240]   What does that mean?
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:38.240]   It literally just means non-reluctant giver.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:42.240]   When we think of generosity, what does that mean?
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.240]   Give liberally like it isn't yours.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.240]   Because it isn't, right?
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:52.240]   How much do you spend time thinking about money?
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:56.240]   Maybe you're in a career of finance.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.240]   Probably you're thinking about money a lot.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:03.240]   But for the most part, I think a lot of us do spend some time thinking about money.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.240]   I don't have enough of it.
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.240]   I have debts.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.240]   I have bills.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:16.240]   I have this I want to save up for, or this college fund I got to think about my kids over.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.240]   How much of time do you spend thinking?
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:23.240]   Remember we talked about the rubber meets the road time and money?
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:28.240]   How much of that time is spent thinking about your finances?
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:37.240]   When you think about finances or investing or investments, do you think about eternity?
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.240]   I'm thinking about my 401(k).
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:48.240]   Is eternity coming to mind in the context of your thinking about how to handle your money?
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:54.240]   And to be fair, this is an encouragement and challenge to me as well.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:04.240]   To think in aspects of how I spend my money, how is that benefiting the gospel enterprise?
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.240]   How are you using that money for the furtherance of God's kingdom?
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:15.240]   One thing is we talk about, if you know anything about finances and financial planners and these people in finance,
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:20.240]   they will say, "Are you investing in your future?"
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.240]   You've heard that phrase, "Are you investing in your future?"
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.240]   What does that mean?
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:32.240]   Are you thinking the long, I have it written down here, the long-term future?
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.240]   And what is that?
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.240]   Not retirement.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.240]   It's eternity.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.240]   The long aspects of our future.
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   Jesus made it very clear in Matthew 6.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:52.240]   He says in verse 19, "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal,
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:26:02.240]   but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:07.240]   For where your treasure is, there your heart will also be."
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:12.240]   So I found this quote from one of my favorite pastors, Pastor John Piper.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.240]   If you could put that on, read this with me.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.240]   He says it like it is.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:24.240]   "My take on tithing in America is that it's a middle-class way of robbing God.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:29.240]   Tithing to the church and spending the rest on your family is not a Christian goal.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.240]   It's a diversion.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:38.240]   The real issue is how shall we use God's trust fund, namely, all we have for his glory?
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:45.240]   In a world with so much misery, what lifestyle should we call our people to live?
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.240]   What example are we setting?"
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.240]   So I kind of stopped there and thought about what example am I setting?
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:59.240]   I thought of the phrase, "Put your money where your mouth is."
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:11.240]   I also thought, when the non-believers hear about you tithing, it's 10% of your income, right?
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.240]   It's a tenth.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.240]   What is their reaction?
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:22.240]   What is the reaction of the world when they say, "You give 10% of your money to the church?"
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:26.240]   What do they think?
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:34.240]   So what percentage is appropriate for a believer in Christ who has received everything?
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:40.240]   This idea of comfort in finance, this idea of comfort in general,
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.240]   we've heard it many times on this pulpit.
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.240]   We like to say Orange County Christianity, right?
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.240]   We've heard that phrase.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.240]   But what is that?
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:54.240]   It's the idea of this push for our whole culture to push for areas of our lives
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:05.240]   that make it easier, whether that be comfort of automation, self-driving cars, efficiencies.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:11.240]   So in those aspects of comfort, how should we view our finances?
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:17.240]   The phrase, "You should have enough to take care of you for the rest of your life."
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:23.240]   Is that how God views how to handle the money he's given to you and us as stewards?
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.240]   Is that what he's saying?
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   "Oh, you should take care of yourself for the rest of your life."
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.240]   And then you could start thinking about others.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:41.240]   So many of us are frugal and track every cent of money that we have.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.240]   Not a bad thing.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:48.240]   So why are we so particular about every single cent?
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.240]   Because, as Corbin Jentz said, money is very important.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.240]   Right?
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:29:01.240]   I titled this sermon, "Is He Worthy of Your Finances?"
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:07.240]   The question is, of course he is.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:12.240]   But do you really think it's your finances?
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:20.240]   This idea of how do we spend our finances for gospel ministry.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:28.240]   I thought about Paul's example of he's using the Philippians as a prime example of their participating.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:35.240]   And he thanks them for financials because it's moving the gospel forward.
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:42.240]   It just so happens, as I was thinking through that, what is going on now?
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:51.240]   We have a team in India, and many of us in our church, I think it's 51.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:55.240]   51 India pastors are supported by our church.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.240]   And that's awesome.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.240]   That's awesome.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:02.240]   What are we supporting?
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.240]   What are we supporting?
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:10.240]   We're supporting them so they can free themselves for gospel ministry.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.240]   And what kind of ministry?
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:17.240]   Think about what we hear from our brothers and sisters in India.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:21.240]   They're literally on the front lines of gospel enterprise.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:27.240]   They walk into villages where they don't know anything about Jesus.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.240]   And what is the result of that?
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.240]   They get persecuted.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.240]   They've been beaten.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.240]   Almost killed.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.240]   Guess what, folks?
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.240]   Brothers and sisters, we are participating in that.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.240]   We are giving our resources for the funding of gospel ministry.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:53.240]   So when you view giving to the church, when you view giving to gospel enterprise, you're on the team.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.240]   You're supporting that team.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:59.240]   I thought about the idea of, you know, we pay money to go see sports.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:03.240]   I remember Pastor Peter just talking about Kobe and his sports.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:11.240]   And I thought about this, that we participate in this team because we pay money to support it, right?
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.240]   In a much grander way.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:25.240]   When we put our finances for gospel ministry, especially with these India pastors, it's kind of like an analogy of World War II.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:29.240]   I don't know how much history you guys read or whatnot.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.240]   World War II is pretty far removed from us now.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:49.240]   But when World War II was happening, America's attitude was we have to ration to support the effort of fighting this evil.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.240]   I don't even want to think about it.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.240]   Imagine if Germany won.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.240]   A lot of us might not even be here.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.240]   I don't know.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:06.240]   But the attitude should be when we're giving our finances, remember I talked about gospel-centeredness.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:13.240]   The aim of our money to be given to the Lord's work is for that purpose.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:25.240]   That we move and think through our finances when we oftentimes think only about, "Okay, what am I going to do with my money?"
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.240]   "Obviously I've got to pay bills."
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:35.240]   And I'm not saying here to not pay your bills and live out on the street.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.240]   That's not the point.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:44.240]   The point is the self-evaluation and hard attitude of how you view this money that God has given to you as stewards.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:47.240]   Given to us as stewards.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:56.240]   So the goal of this topical message and this covenant is to commit to the idea of gospel enterprise.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:01.240]   Gospel work.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:09.240]   So when we think about specific ways to participate in the gospel through the money.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:15.240]   So I kind of laid out some.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.240]   Number one, give finances for the church.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.240]   Let me stop there.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:29.240]   This idea, everything, all of these other things should be run and filtered through the church.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:33.240]   God established the church.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.240]   We are his bride.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:42.240]   We are the body of Christ in the description of the church.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:50.240]   So the priority of finances should first and foremost go to the church for gospel enterprise.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.240]   Missionaries, obviously.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:34:02.240]   We have China, the India support.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:11.240]   As I was thinking through this again, this idea of not to be prideful or confident or anything like that.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:22.240]   But there's a sense of immense gratefulness that we even have this relationship where we can participate and pray for
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:29.240]   and hear these crazy testimonies coming out of India for the furtherance and pushing of God's kingdom.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.240]   Right.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:34.240]   And if you don't know, there's a lot of fruit being born through that.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:44.240]   I don't think we get to disseminate as so much information, but people are coming to Christ by the work of these Indian pastors.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:48.240]   And hopefully the continued support as our teams out there.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.240]   Compassion kids.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:55.240]   Pastor Peter Chung spent many years in compassion.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:58.240]   It's the support of the local church that we're doing.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:07.240]   We're supporting the local church for the furtherance of taking care of these kids for gospel ministry.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.240]   Adoption is the orphans.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.240]   What more?
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:19.240]   What better way to bring them into your home and saturate them with the gospel?
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.240]   And other ministries.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:29.240]   I am the beneficiary of when I was a younger Christian, I listened to a lot of radio sermons.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:37.240]   I spent a lot of time in a car like eight hours a day, and I filled my mind with these radio programs of sermons.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:43.240]   And it was so refreshing.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.240]   So in essence, can we support them as well?
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.240]   Yes.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.240]   Are they gospel centered?
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.240]   Yes.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:58.240]   So this idea of finances, it permeates every day of our life.
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:05.240]   And the covenant says I commit to tithing and giving financially.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:12.240]   But I want to encourage our church, that is in the Old Testament, that was the bare minimum.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:16.240]   I want you and us to think about the percentages.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:23.240]   If you want to think about percentages, what percentage is appropriate for gospel ministry?
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:30.240]   If I left the idea of Romans chapter 12 verse 1, offer your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing,
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:38.240]   and left it at that and said, how are you going to handle the fleshing out of what God says when he says give everything you have?
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:44.240]   How does that apply to my finances for your offering before God?
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:48.240]   We can think through time, how much time can I spend giving to God?
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.240]   But this is the tangible for us day to day.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:57.240]   How much can I think about how much money I'm going to give?
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:05.240]   Again, I want to reiterate, this isn't a desire to milk our church.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:14.240]   This is a desire for evaluating and self-examining how I view the spending of my money.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:19.240]   And we all agree and understand that it's not my money.
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:23.240]   How are we using that for gospel ministry and gospel purposes?
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:33.240]   And that's the encouragement that we sign, in accordance with the Lordship of Christ over our life.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   So, be encouraged.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:40.240]   A lot of people were like, I have my checkbook today.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:44.240]   That wasn't the goal.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.240]   Bring your checks and put it in the offering.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.240]   That wasn't the goal.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:56.240]   I mean, it really hit home for me as I was reflecting and thinking, I have that same attitude sometimes.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:01.240]   Well, what am I going to spend my money on to benefit me or my family?
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:05.240]   Should that be the number one thought process?
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.240]   No, it shouldn't.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:18.240]   If we are gospel-centered people, we need to start integrating that rubber-meets-the-road kind of attitude about money into everything that we do.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.240]   And it's not just about money, it's about our time, everything.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:27.240]   So, I just got the privilege of dealing with this sensitive topic about money.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.240]   So with that, let's go ahead and pray.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:39.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
