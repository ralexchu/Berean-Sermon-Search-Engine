[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.600]   Are we just starting?
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.280]   All right, we're starting.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.400]   Well, good morning, church family.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.040]   We are a little bit more cozy and intimate today
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:28.140]   'cause we do have 800 of us out in the desert.
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.840]   And we're having a good time out there,
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.120]   not to rub that in,
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.680]   but we are just resting and observing
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.720]   the Lord's day this morning.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.800]   And I wanna just read a passage of scripture,
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.820]   five verses for us to meditate on,
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.900]   and then we will begin our service.
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.520]   From Psalm 57, verse seven to 11.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:56.280]   My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.920]   I will sing, yes, I will sing praises.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:04.600]   Awake my glory, awake harp and lyre.
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.860]   I will awaken the dawn.
[00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:10.260]   I will give thanks to you, O Lord, among the peoples.
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.180]   I will sing praises to you among the nations,
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.540]   for your loving kindness is great to the heavens
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.780]   and your truth to the clouds.
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.340]   Be exalted above the heavens, O God.
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.960]   Let your glory be above all the earth, amen.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.220]   This passage is in the context of a lot of wrestling
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.540]   that David is doing.
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:34.020]   And situationally, this is not a good time for him,
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.820]   but he commands his heart to give praise.
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.880]   And so whether you have ample reasons
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.900]   to just say thank you,
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.660]   or it's a little bit more of a wrestling,
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.900]   like, Lord, I know theologically you are so good,
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.620]   but right now I don't feel it.
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.860]   This is when we command our hearts.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.740]   I will give thanks to the Lord.
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.480]   Be exalted, O God, above the heavens,
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.620]   and let your glory be above all the earth.
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:03.300]   And so we're gonna sing about the Lord
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.420]   and his greatness this morning.
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:09.220]   But let me lead us just in a song
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.220]   that you guys know how great is our God.

[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:56.140]   - Let's begin with a couple of announcements.
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:57.940]   As you guys can tell,
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:01.940]   it's a little bit of a sparser gathering this morning.
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.420]   As I mentioned at the beginning, the retreat is going on
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.020]   and they're doing Sunday worship up there
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.540]   with Pastor Carlos right now.
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:14.420]   And so because most of our people are at Palm Desert,
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.900]   there's not gonna really be anything
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.580]   outside of our service today.
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.260]   So we're not gonna have the cafe.
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.620]   I would assume parking was pretty easy this morning, right?
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.860]   And so there's nothing going on
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:29.660]   outside of just a time of just feeding of the word
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.780]   and praise to the Lord.
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:35.460]   But a couple of announcements that pertain
[00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.060]   to things that are coming up,
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:41.180]   our Bible study will begin on August 30th.
[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.020]   And if you have not signed up,
[00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.500]   we need you to sign up because if you don't,
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.740]   you won't be placed in a group
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:49.020]   or you'll be placed in a group afterward.
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.140]   And if you're, let's say 22,
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:53.660]   you might be in a group of 50 year old women, all right?
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:55.340]   Assuming you're a girl, all right?
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.700]   So please do sign up
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.260]   because the groups are still being finalized.
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.660]   And if you don't sign up,
[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:02.620]   then you're gonna be in some kind of a hodgepodge group
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.180]   or you're gonna be stuck with me at my table
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:05.420]   for the whole semester.
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.660]   So that's coming up.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.220]   For the men of our church, September 9th,
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:14.140]   we have a men's ministry fellowship workshop
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.140]   followed by a lunch.
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.420]   And so that's gonna be $10.
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.020]   The signup sheet is on our app
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.860]   and you can just follow along there as well.
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:30.620]   If you are a parent of a child in the elementary department,
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.820]   we call that the Sprouts Ministry,
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:37.220]   there will be just a parents meeting on September 10th.
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.060]   Okay?
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.300]   And there are some, if you're a family member,
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.060]   if you have a spouse and you have kids,
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:45.300]   there are some announcements that pertain to you
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.940]   on the app and on the website.
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.860]   So I will refer you to those.
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:50.700]   Okay.
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.180]   Right now we're gonna take a time of offering.
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.380]   If you have a physical offering,
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.940]   you can bring it to the back over there,
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:59.300]   just at your convenience
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.260]   and whenever your heart feels ready to do that.
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:04.700]   Otherwise, we encourage you to give your offering
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:09.220]   to the Lord electronically through OnlyZell.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.060]   All right?
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.300]   So let me go ahead and pray.
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.420]   We don't have any baptisms or anything today,
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:15.700]   but let me just pray,
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.780]   give you a little bit of time to just prepare your hearts
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:23.380]   and then we'll continue with our time of praise.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.580]   Father, we're so thankful to be gathered here this morning.
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:32.580]   And Lord, we pray for your word to be proclaimed
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:37.260]   in a powerful way to your flock,
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:38.660]   and especially Lord God,
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.020]   to our church family that is here this morning
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:45.820]   and those that have started worship up in Palm Desert.
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.280]   Father, would you minister to your people,
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.740]   not for the sake of us just growing in knowledge,
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.700]   but Lord, that we would grow to be a people
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.820]   who respond appropriately
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.220]   and wholly living in love for our brothers and sisters
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.620]   and love for our neighbors.
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.780]   Lord, ultimately so that you would receive glory
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.140]   in our lives.
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:09.940]   We pray that as we just bring our offering,
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.940]   Lord, it's a sign of just our response to say,
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.820]   Lord God, everything that we have is yours.
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:19.540]   And so continue to give us wisdom
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.900]   to steward all that we have, our time,
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.500]   our resources and our opportunities.
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:29.100]   Help us to steward those well in faith and in worship.
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.820]   So we thank you, God, for just being so kind to us.
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.020]   And we pray that this morning that you would be honored.
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.980]   And we pray all of this in Jesus' name.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:43.280]   (gentle music)
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.700]   (gentle music continues)

[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.180]   - Amen, please be seated.
[00:40:50.180 --> 00:41:02.900]   It really is a joy for us to be able to hear the word of God
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:06.260]   from our guest speaker this morning.
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:09.300]   A lot of you guys know who Pastor James Lee is.
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.860]   He is the senior pastor at Cross Life Bible Church,
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.740]   which is also in Irvine.
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:19.260]   And from the day Cross Life became a church,
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:22.780]   we've been right there alongside with Pastor James,
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:27.020]   praying for, supporting, and encouraging
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.220]   to the best of our ability this church.
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:33.940]   And today he's gonna be speaking the word of God for us.
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.180]   So if you guys can, just as he walks up,
[00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:41.180]   just give him a big warm applause and a thank you in advance.
[00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:43.540]   So let's welcome Pastor James up.
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.700]   (audience applauding)
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:54.580]   - All right, well, it's good to see everyone.
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.220]   It's much more filled than I thought it would be.
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:01.780]   So again, it's a pleasure just to be here
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.980]   and to be preaching God's word.
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:04.980]   Hold on for one sec.
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.880]   Oh, I can't move that.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.700]   That was awkward.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:10.540]   All right.
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.860]   Well, I just wanna begin by saying,
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:15.960]   thank you so much for having me to come
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.900]   and minister the word to all of you.
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:22.740]   Berean is a dear church to us.
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.280]   Your pastors are dear friends to me.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.700]   I just had lunch with Pastor,
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:28.340]   or breakfast with Pastor Peter yesterday,
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.500]   and he treated me out for breakfast.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:35.500]   And your pastor, Pastor Peter, he's a mentor to me.
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.940]   He's an older brother in the faith,
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:39.140]   and he has guided me and helped me
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.600]   as I try to lead and shepherd our church.
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.360]   And I'm just really thankful for him.
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:47.080]   So you are in good hands under his ministry,
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:50.280]   and I'm thankful for Pastor Peter Chung, Pastor Mark.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.640]   Pastor Mark was a classmate of mine in seminary,
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:53.700]   and Pastor Nate.
[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:55.960]   Yeah, wonderful.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.160]   You guys are really blessed.
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:01.320]   And I hope, coming in and out of a church like this,
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.200]   regularly attending a ministry like this,
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.880]   it's kind of easy to,
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.040]   you know, when you're eating steak every day,
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:09.080]   it's just kind of a common thing.
[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:10.340]   You eat galbi every day.
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:12.800]   It's like, it's good, right?
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:13.720]   And then you go out,
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.200]   and then you don't have any of that,
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.120]   you eat porridge, and you're like, man, I had a good.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.020]   You guys are eating, you guys are eating well here.
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.980]   And I want you to realize that your pastors
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:24.840]   who are cooking up this meal,
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:27.840]   they're doing it with much prayer, with much love.
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.160]   And I want you guys to never take that for granted.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.840]   And even Pastor Peter Chung, he was at the retreat.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:34.680]   He was at the retreat.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.560]   He could have just told me to come and just, you know,
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.120]   preach and be done with it.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.360]   But he came all the way here, drove back here
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:45.640]   to minister to all of you and to care for you.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.600]   And that just shows the kind of hearts
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.200]   that your pastors have at Berean.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.700]   So I just want to really encourage you.
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:56.240]   You're at a wonderful place, and you are truly blessed.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.000]   And so, you know, thank Pastor Peter Chung.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.840]   Don't forget to do that.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.640]   He's very approachable.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.900]   When the other pastors come, be sure to appreciate them
[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.760]   and to express your love to them.
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.860]   They are, again, wonderful, wonderful men.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:14.600]   Well, today, I was thinking about what to preach on,
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.660]   and I thought it might be fun and a blessing
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.680]   to go over a subject that is relatively new to me
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.240]   in my theological journey and study,
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.900]   and that is the subject of rest.
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:27.800]   It came to my attention this morning
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:32.800]   that the people who might attend service today
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:37.100]   may be guests, newcomers to the church.
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:38.860]   I totally didn't think about that,
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:41.700]   because there might be some of you
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.300]   who are relatively new to the faith,
[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:48.220]   young as Christians, maybe even seeking
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:50.780]   as seeking and trying to search out
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.660]   what Christianity is about.
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:56.760]   Now, the Bible talks about the pure milk of God's word.
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:59.780]   It talks about milk being given to spiritual infants.
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:04.900]   I realize that today's study is just gonna be tough steak.
[00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:08.740]   So, hopefully, you'll be able to process it,
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:13.740]   and if there are any questions about the study today,
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:17.680]   Pastor Peter and I, we would love to just stay behind
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:20.040]   and talk and chat with you about the gospel,
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.240]   about the word of God.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:24.300]   And so, again, the subject I wanted to talk about
[00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.400]   was the subject of rest.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.920]   The subject of rest is infused
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.320]   with salvific implications and realities.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.420]   Oftentimes, when we think about salvation,
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:35.040]   we normally think about things like justification,
[00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.560]   sanctification, glorification.
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:37.840]   We think about redemption.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.960]   We think about faith.
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.560]   We think about the gospel of the kingdom.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.640]   But a term that may not come to our minds very often
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.800]   is the concept of rest, rest.
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.480]   Now, I was studying through and preaching
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.000]   through the book of 1 and 2 Samuel,
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.280]   and I came across the relationship
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.800]   between the kingdom of God and the concept of rest.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.880]   In the promise of the Davidic covenant,
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:01.240]   it says the following in 2 Samuel 7, verse 10 to 13.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.760]   If you will take your Bibles and turn with me
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.360]   to 2 Samuel 7, verse 10 to 13,
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.520]   we're gonna do a lot of Bible flipping today.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:11.060]   2 Samuel 7, verse 10 to 13.
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:25.920]   So this is the promise of the Davidic covenant.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.680]   2 Samuel 7, verse 10 to 13.
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:31.280]   It says, "And I will appoint a place for my people Israel
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.140]   "and will plant them so that they may dwell
[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:36.520]   "in their own place and be disturbed no more.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.800]   "And violent men shall afflict them no more,
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.140]   "as formerly from the time that I appointed judges
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:43.100]   "over my people Israel.
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:47.500]   "And I will give you rest from all your enemies.
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:49.040]   "Moreover, the Lord declares to you
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.980]   "that the Lord will make you a house.
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:51.920]   "When your days are fulfilled
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.080]   "and you lie down with your fathers,
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.580]   "I will raise up your offspring after you
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:56.700]   "who shall come from your body,
[00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.680]   "and I will establish his kingdom.
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:00.000]   "You shall build a house for my name,
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.100]   "and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever."
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:05.240]   Now take your Bibles and turn with me
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:08.200]   to 1 Chronicles, chapter 22.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.820]   1 Chronicles, chapter 22.
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:15.440]   The chronicler extends the attribute of rest in the kingdom
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:20.080]   to the king himself, to a son of David, a son of David.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.920]   So 1 Chronicles, chapter 22, verse seven through 10.
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.680]   (pages rustling)
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:35.520]   It says this.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:40.380]   David said to Solomon, "My son, I had it in my heart
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:43.200]   "to build a house to the name of the Lord my God."
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.560]   Verse eight.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:47.300]   "But the word of the Lord came to me,
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:48.900]   "saying, 'You have shed much blood
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.500]   "'and have waged great wars.
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.260]   "'You shall not build a house to my name,
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.960]   "'because you have shed so much blood
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.340]   "'before me on the earth.
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:58.640]   "'Behold, a son shall be born to you
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.800]   "'who shall be a man of rest.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.700]   "'I will give him rest from all his surrounding enemies,
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.500]   "'for his name shall be Solomon,
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:10.000]   "'and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.960]   "'He shall build a house for my name,
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:15.080]   "'he shall be my son, and I will be his father,
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:18.380]   "'and I will establish his royal throne in Israel forever.'"
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:22.500]   And so a promise is given that David will have a child,
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.700]   he will be known as a child of rest.
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:25.820]   Now as you know, the promise of a king
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:28.560]   extends beyond Solomon to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:32.200]   Matthew chapter 12, verse 42, it says,
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.920]   "The queen of the south will rise up
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.720]   "at the judgment with this generation and condemn it,
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.240]   "for she came from the ends of the earth
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.660]   "to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:44.120]   "and behold, something greater than Solomon is here."
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:47.180]   And as one who is greater than Solomon,
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.420]   Jesus brings a rest that is much more profound
[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:51.340]   than political and international peace,
[00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:53.440]   but he brings a rest that is spiritual,
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.640]   a rest that is heavenly.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:58.300]   Take your Bibles and turn with me to Hebrews chapter four.
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:48:59.380]   Hebrews chapter four.
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:06.620]   Hebrews chapter four, verse one through 10.
[00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:11.320]   This is the reading of God's word.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:16.820]   "Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.540]   "still stands, let us fear, lest any of you
[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:22.200]   "should seem to have failed to reach it.
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.360]   "For good news came to us just as to them,
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.760]   "but the message they heard did not benefit them,
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.760]   "because they were not united by faith
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.980]   "with those who listen.
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:33.660]   "For we who have believed enter that rest,
[00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:35.620]   "as he had said, as I swore my wrath,
[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:37.420]   "they shall not enter my rest,
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:38.700]   "although his works were finished
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.140]   "from the foundation of the world.
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:43.540]   "For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:46.020]   "in this way, and God rested on the seventh day
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:47.380]   "from all his works."
[00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:49.060]   And again, in this passage, he said,
[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:51.100]   "They shall not enter my rest,
[00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.960]   "since therefore it remains for some to enter it,
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.820]   "and those who formerly received the good news
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:58.200]   "failed to enter because of disobedience."
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:01.040]   Again, he appoints a certain day today, saying,
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.080]   "Through David, so long afterwards,"
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.520]   in the words already quoted today,
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.480]   "If you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:10.040]   "For Joshua had given them rest,
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.860]   "God would not have spoken of another day later on."
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:15.220]   So then there remains a Sabbath rest
[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:16.420]   for the people of God,
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:18.340]   but whoever has entered God's rest
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:21.880]   has also rested from his works as God did from his.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:25.240]   Now, the rest that God offers to us,
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.820]   ultimately, is a rest that is in heaven,
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:30.580]   but to enter that rest, we must find our rest in Christ.
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:31.740]   So today, what I wanna do,
[00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:35.260]   I wanna develop the biblical theology of rest,
[00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:37.780]   the biblical theology of rest.
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:39.900]   But before we do that, join me in a time of prayer.
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:40.740]   Let's pray.
[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:47.660]   Father, how good it is to come before your word.
[00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:51.900]   Your word is holy and it is true.
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:53.620]   It is the revelation from above.
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:58.900]   It is ultimately the words of God, pen through men.
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:02.820]   And Lord, I pray that all of us here,
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:05.380]   as we hear your word, read your word,
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:07.380]   that we will submit ourselves to it
[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:08.520]   and that the truth of your word
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:11.420]   would impress itself upon our hearts, it would convict us.
[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:14.700]   And God, I pray for the congregation here,
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:17.580]   your body here, that they would be a people,
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:23.660]   take a step back from the busyness and the chaos of life,
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:24.940]   the troubles of pain,
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:28.140]   and to realize that there is rest in Christ.
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:32.500]   May we come to you, Lord Jesus,
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.660]   all who are burdened and heavy laden.
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:39.180]   And Lord, we know that we will find our rest in you.
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:40.700]   Pray this in your name, amen.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.620]   One of the things that,
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:47.200]   interesting things about this text
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.040]   in the book of Hebrews, Hebrews chapter four,
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.320]   is that the author seems to talk about three kinds of rest.
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.520]   You notice that when we just read that.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.080]   He talks about three kinds of rest.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.720]   He talks about a creation rest.
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:59.120]   So let's look at verse four, look at verse four.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:02.520]   For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way,
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:05.960]   and God rested on the seventh day from all of his works.
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.520]   So there's a creation rest.
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.840]   The second kind of rest that he talks about
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:12.880]   is a land rest, that is rest in the land of Canaan.
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.920]   You look at verse five, chapter four, verse five,
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.280]   and again in this passage he said,
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.720]   "They shall not enter my rest."
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:22.760]   Verse eight, he says, "For if Joshua had given them rest,
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.840]   "God would not have spoken of another day later on."
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.240]   You know that after the nation of Israel
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:29.520]   was redeemed from Egypt during the days of the Exodus,
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.420]   Joshua, who succeeded Moses,
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:33.880]   led the people of God into the promised land,
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:36.080]   the place of rest.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.440]   And you immediately notice
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.280]   that the two types of rest are very different.
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.600]   The first one has to do with time,
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:42.060]   where God rested on the seventh day
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:43.720]   after he created the world.
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:46.080]   The second rest has to do with the place,
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.020]   the place of rest, where the land of Israel
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.520]   was called the place of rest, the land of promise.
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:54.600]   Now the last reference to rest, the third reference,
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.880]   is to the celestial country of heaven.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.180]   And like the second type of rest, it's a place,
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.200]   albeit a place outside of this world.
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.040]   So if you look at chapter four, verse one, it says,
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.160]   "Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:09.500]   "still stands, let us fear,
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.960]   "lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it."
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:14.800]   And verse nine says, "So then, there remains a Sabbath rest
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.000]   "for the people of God."
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   Talking about heaven.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   Now the question is, how do all of these references to rest
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.580]   relate to each other?
[00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:27.340]   How is creation rest, land rest,
[00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:29.420]   and heavenly rest connected?
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:31.480]   So in order to answer that question,
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.200]   we're gonna dive into each one of these types of rest,
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:34.960]   and then we're gonna string them together
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.440]   to develop a biblical theology of rest.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.520]   Okay, so that's what we're gonna do today.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:40.780]   That sounds like fun, I think it's fun.
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:42.240]   Okay, yes.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.940]   Creation rest, creation rest, let's talk about that.
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:48.140]   Genesis chapter two, verse one through three.
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:50.900]   You can just listen here.
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:52.620]   Many of you are familiar with this story.
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:54.140]   "Thus, the heavens and the earth were finished,
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:55.120]   "and all the hosts of them.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.820]   "And on the seventh day, God finished his work
[00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:59.960]   "that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:02.240]   "from all his work that he had done.
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.900]   "So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy,
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:06.480]   "because on it, God rested from all his work
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.480]   "that he had done in creation.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:13.040]   "And the Lord made the world, he rested on the seventh day."
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.680]   Now, the reason why that is significant
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:18.980]   is because the rest signaled the completion
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:21.940]   of a perfect and sinless creation
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:26.660]   where mankind communed with God in the Garden of Eden.
[00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:28.360]   Okay, I'll say that again.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:31.680]   The reason why it's significant,
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:34.500]   why it's significant that God rested on the seventh day
[00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:38.300]   is because the rest signaled a completion
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:40.660]   of a perfect and sinless creation
[00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:44.260]   where mankind communed with God in the Garden of Eden.
[00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:46.480]   So the biblical idea of rest includes two elements,
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:49.860]   perfect creation, epitomized in Eden,
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:51.220]   and communion with God.
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:52.580]   These are the two things.
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:56.140]   So if you're taking notes, this is two things to jot down.
[00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:58.480]   Perfect creation, epitomized in Eden,
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.120]   and communion with God.
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.160]   Now, within the Garden of Eden,
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.420]   there are several significant items,
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:03.980]   including the tree of life.
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:05.780]   There are rivers and precious stones.
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:07.660]   These are the kind of details you might just overlook
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:10.540]   when you're reading the story, but they're very significant.
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:14.260]   And the reason why it's important to single these things out
[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:17.220]   to pick out these details is because
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:20.380]   when you look at the allusions later on in scripture
[00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:21.960]   with progressive revelation,
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.780]   you'll see the writers referencing back
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:27.640]   and alluding back to the creation account.
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:31.220]   So let's look at Genesis chapter two, verse nine through 12.
[00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:33.380]   Genesis chapter two, verse nine through 12.
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:35.540]   (silence)
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:42.140]   Genesis chapter two, verse nine through 12.
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:43.380]   It says the following,
[00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:45.860]   and out of the ground the Lord God made
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:49.340]   to spring up every tree that is pleasant to sight
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:50.660]   and good for food.
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:53.220]   The tree of life was in the midst of the garden
[00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:55.540]   and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:58.380]   A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden,
[00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:00.620]   and there it divided and became four rivers.
[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:03.060]   The name of the first is the Pishon.
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.840]   It is the one that flowed around the whole land Havilah
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:09.060]   where there is gold, and the gold of that land is good.
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:11.900]   Delium and onyx stones are there.
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:13.540]   So again, very important details.
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.660]   Even though God,
[00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:17.600]   now even though God created the world in perfection,
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:19.260]   we know what happens in Genesis chapter three.
[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:23.140]   Mankind sins against God, and all of creation is cursed.
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:25.060]   Mankind is corrupted.
[00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:27.580]   In Genesis chapter three, verse 17 to 19,
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:28.740]   it says the following,
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:29.560]   and to Adam he said,
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.420]   because you have listened to the voice of your wife
[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:33.500]   and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you,
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:35.000]   you shall not eat of it.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.840]   Cursed is the ground because of you.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:40.100]   In pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life.
[00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:42.860]   Thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you,
[00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:44.740]   and you shall eat the plants of the field.
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:47.260]   By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:48.460]   till you return to the ground,
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:50.900]   for out of it you were taken, for you are dust,
[00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:53.000]   and to dust you shall return.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.620]   In Romans chapter five, verse 12, it says,
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:58.500]   therefore just as sin came into the world through one man
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:56:59.340]   and death through sin,
[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:02.320]   so death spread to all men because all sin.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:07.780]   So as a result, as a result of sin,
[00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:10.240]   rest was stripped away from man.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:14.180]   Creation was corrupted, man was kicked out of Eden,
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:16.260]   and man's relationship, communion with God,
[00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:18.220]   was severed, was broken.
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:21.360]   Life itself will be wrought with sweat, blood, and tears.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:24.140]   Nature would attack man in the form of natural disasters,
[00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:26.320]   including earthquakes, tsunamis, droughts, and floods.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:28.500]   Life would no longer be one of rest.
[00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:31.580]   And again, this is not something that is just theoretical,
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:33.140]   but something that all of us have felt, right?
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:34.660]   We felt all of this.
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:37.900]   I mean, think about 2020, I mean, the virus,
[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:39.720]   that tiny little thing.
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:42.660]   It's just the struggle, the pain that it caused.
[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:44.620]   The thorns and thistles of your daily grind at work,
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:46.300]   the pain of losing somebody that you love.
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:47.940]   And although there's times of respite,
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:51.420]   there's vacation time, there's maybe an escape to retreat,
[00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:55.340]   we will never be able to escape the pains of sin.
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:57.220]   We can never restore the alienation from God,
[00:57:57.220 --> 00:57:59.500]   that separation, or avoid death,
[00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:00.940]   or bypass eternal condemnation.
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:03.500]   And so generally, we can't say that we are at rest.
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.820]   No matter how good things might be on this earth,
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:09.340]   we can never say it's restful.
[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:12.240]   At least we can't say it permanently, finally, ultimately.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:15.100]   The rest of the seventh day after creation
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:17.660]   was disrupted by the entrance of sin.
[00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.180]   The biblical story about man's redemption,
[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:23.780]   therefore, includes his return from chaos and unrest
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:25.780]   of a fallen creation to a new day
[00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:29.080]   where he can once again rest with his creator.
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:36.940]   So that begins the framework
[00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:39.540]   of understanding the concept of rest, creation rest.
[00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:41.420]   Now, the second type of rest
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:44.380]   that the author of Hebrews mentions is the land rest.
[00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:45.380]   And again, when I say land,
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:48.220]   I'm referring to the promised land of Canaan.
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:50.100]   In Psalm chapter 95, verse 10 through 11,
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:51.380]   it says the following.
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:53.900]   For 40 years, I loathed the generation and said,
[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:56.500]   "They are a people who go astray in their hearts,
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:58.660]   "and they have not known my ways.
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:58:59.700]   "Therefore, I swore in my wrath,
[00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:02.820]   "they shall not enter my rest."
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:05.100]   They shall not enter my rest.
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:06.860]   The rest here is a reference to the land of Canaan.
[00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:08.500]   And it's important now for us
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:09.980]   to understand the historical context
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:13.140]   in which this is understood.
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:13.980]   Psalm 95.
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:16.660]   Before Israel made their journey
[00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:18.700]   into the promised land of Canaan,
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:20.180]   they were enslaved in Egypt.
[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:22.380]   Very common story is if you grew up
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:24.780]   in the church in Sunday school.
[00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:26.580]   They were enslaved.
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:28.220]   But God in his great mercy delivered them
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:31.940]   from their bondage by pouring out various plagues.
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:32.780]   Poured out his wrath.
[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:35.540]   And the last judgment that was finally released
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:37.340]   against Pharaoh and the Egyptians
[00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:39.940]   was the death of the firstborn, the last plague.
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:42.020]   In Exodus chapter 11, verse four through six,
[00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:43.540]   it says, "So Moses said,
[00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:45.060]   "'Thus says the Lord, about midnight,
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:46.940]   "'I will go out in the midst of Egypt,
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:50.180]   "'and every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die.
[00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:52.300]   "'The firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne,
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:54.140]   "'even to the firstborn of a slave girl
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:55.340]   "'who is behind the hand mill,
[00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:57.100]   "'and all the firstborn of the cattle.
[00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:59.820]   "'There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt
[00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:04.340]   "'such as there has never been nor ever will be again.'"
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:08.340]   So death of the firstborn, a horrific judgment,
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.940]   horrific plague.
[01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.820]   "But the nation of Israel will be spared from that judgment
[01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.620]   "because they will slaughter a lamb,
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:17.140]   "they'll take the blood and spread it across a doorpost.
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:19.260]   "The blood will serve as a sign to the Lord
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:21.420]   "who would then pass over that household
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.500]   "and spare the firstborn of the family."
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.420]   Effectively, the death of a lamb
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:28.820]   took the place of the life of the firstborn child.
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.220]   Now, of course, in fulfillment of God's word,
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:33.260]   all the families of Egypt lost their firstborn,
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:35.500]   including the household of Pharaoh,
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:39.940]   so that the king finally let the people of Israel go.
[01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:42.940]   What we see is that through the blood of a Passover lamb,
[01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:45.140]   the people of God, they were redeemed,
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:48.140]   they were delivered, they were ransomed from slavery
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:51.220]   and brought into the promised land of Canaan,
[01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.420]   the land of rest.
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:56.100]   So that's the historical background.
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.700]   Now, the question at this point is to ask,
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:03.700]   why was the land of Canaan called the resting place of God?
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:07.820]   Why was the land of Canaan called the resting place of God?
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:12.740]   And the answer is because, this is cool, okay?
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:15.580]   The land of Canaan was supposed to be symbolic
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:17.340]   of the Garden of Eden.
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.100]   Okay?
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:21.460]   It was supposed to be Edenic.
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:24.420]   Listen to the language that is used to describe Canaan.
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:26.500]   I'll just read this for you guys.
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:27.340]   Just listen.
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:29.620]   "And I have come down to deliver them
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:30.860]   "out of the hand of the Egyptians,
[01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:32.980]   "and to bring them out of the land
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.900]   "to a good and broad land,
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:37.420]   "a land flowing with milk and honey,
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:38.980]   "to the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites,
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.420]   "the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites,
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:41.740]   "and the Jebusites."
[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.940]   Deuteronomy chapter six, verse 10 through 11, it says,
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.300]   "And when the Lord your God brings you into the land
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:47.420]   "that he swore to your fathers,
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:49.100]   "to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,
[01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:50.900]   "to give you with great and good cities
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:52.220]   "that you did not build,
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:55.020]   "and houses full of all good things that you did not fill,
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:57.180]   "and cisterns that you did not dig,
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.100]   "and vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant,
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:02.940]   "and when you eat and are full."
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:04.900]   And then it says in Deuteronomy chapter eight,
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:06.300]   verse seven through eight,
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:09.060]   "For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land,
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:11.380]   "a land of brooks, of water, and fountains,
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:14.060]   "and springs flowing out in the valley and the hills,
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:16.660]   "the land of wheat and barley, of vines and fig trees,
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:20.140]   "and pomegranates, and land of olive trees and honey."
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:23.140]   So the Bible uses very vivid language
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:24.540]   to allude back to the Garden of Eden,
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:27.780]   including a reference to rivers and fruit trees.
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:30.300]   And initially when you read something like this,
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:32.740]   the connection may not be very obvious.
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:35.380]   It may not even seem strong to you.
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:38.520]   But the Edenic reference does become much more obvious
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:41.340]   with the building of the temple of God,
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.340]   which was constructed in the heart of the promised land
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:44.880]   in the city of Jerusalem.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:49.780]   When you, and this kind of blew me away
[01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:53.800]   when I came to this realization.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:57.340]   When you read about the temple of God,
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.360]   it was designed to look like a garden.
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.060]   I don't know if you ever caught that detail.
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:04.300]   'Cause you know when you read 1 Kings,
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:05.820]   you read all the details, the lampstand,
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:08.820]   and all the veils and stuff, you just go, ah.
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:11.700]   You know, people try to finish the Bible in a year,
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:14.620]   Genesis to Revelation, and then they're good for Genesis
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:16.300]   in the first half, Exodus,
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.740]   then they die in the wilderness with the Israelites,
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:19.940]   they stop reading, you know.
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:20.860]   (laughs)
[01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:24.440]   You know, and then Levites in the book of Leviticus,
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.280]   like the second death, you know,
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.380]   they try to get back up, go,
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:29.080]   and the book of Leviticus wipes them out,
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.860]   and then they start all over the year after.
[01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:34.120]   Anyways, all that to say,
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.740]   it's very easy to overlook the details
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:40.260]   of the tabernacle and the temple.
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:43.340]   But those details have been given to us from God
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:46.140]   and are meant to be read carefully, intentionally,
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.440]   for they have been given to you for a purpose.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:52.580]   Take your Bibles and turn with me to 1 Kings chapter six.
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:53.780]   1 Kings chapter six.
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:04:08.460]   1 Kings chapter six.
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:11.120]   (clears throat)
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:18.140]   I was talking about the temple, so check this out, okay?
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:19.780]   1 Kings chapter six, verse 18.
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:29.340]   The cedar within the house was carved in the form of gourds
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.180]   and opened flowers.
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:33.860]   All was cedar, no stone was seen.
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:35.020]   Skip down to verse 29.
[01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:38.580]   Around all the walls of the house,
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:42.220]   he carved engraved figures of cherubim and palm trees
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:45.280]   and opened flowers in the inner and outer rooms.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.900]   Skip down to verse 32.
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:49.540]   He covered the two doors of olive wood
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:53.300]   with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and opened flowers.
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:55.580]   He overlaid them with gold and spread gold
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:57.580]   on the cherubim and on the palm trees.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.360]   And if you just read the entire chapter,
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.180]   you begin to notice that a lot of the things
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:03.740]   that were crafted in the temple
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:06.480]   were meant to convey images of fruits, plants, and angels.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.640]   It was made to look like a celestial garden.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:12.220]   Now listen to the description of the lampstand
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:14.360]   that was in the tabernacle and the temple.
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:16.460]   Take your Bibles, turn with me to Exodus chapter 25.
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:17.700]   Exodus chapter 25.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:23.300]   Exodus 25.
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:28.220]   Verse 31 through 33.
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:34.820]   So this is the lampstand, okay?
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:36.060]   Look at this description.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:40.520]   "You shall make a lampstand of pure gold.
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:43.120]   "The lampstand shall be made of hammered works.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:46.200]   "Its base, its stem, its cups, its calyxes,
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:50.340]   "and its flowers shall be of one piece with it.
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:53.500]   "And there shall be six branches going out of its side,
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:56.980]   "and three branches of the lampstand out of one side of it,
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:58.560]   "and three branches of the lampstand
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:05:59.780]   "out of the other side of it.
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:03.200]   "Three cups made like almond blossoms,
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.640]   "each with calyx and flower on one branch,
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.120]   "and three cups made like almond blossoms,
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.360]   "each with calyx and flower on the other branch,
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.680]   "so for the six branches going out of the lampstand."
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:17.760]   Okay, what does that sound like?
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.940]   A tree, right?
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:22.040]   It sounds like a tree, right?
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.760]   It sounds like a tree.
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.620]   I believe it's a direct reference to the tree of life.
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:26.840]   Even when it came down to the entrance,
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:29.000]   both for the garden and the temple,
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.040]   it was located in the east.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.880]   Hence we get the term east of Eden.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:34.320]   In Genesis chapter three, verse 24,
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.880]   it says, "He drove out the man,
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.480]   "and at the east of the garden of Eden,
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.520]   "he placed a cherubim and a flaming sword
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:43.020]   "that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life."
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:45.400]   Exodus chapter 27, verse 12 to 13,
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.100]   this reference to the tabernacle, it says,
[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:49.420]   "And for the breadth of the court on the west side,
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:51.800]   "there shall be hangings for 50 cubits
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.740]   "with 10 pillars and 10 bases.
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:56.860]   "The breadth of the court on the front to the east
[01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:58.480]   "shall be 50 cubits,"
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.940]   which means that the front was facing east.
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:04.400]   And then we get the same detail in the Millennial Temple
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.760]   in Ezekiel chapter 47, verse one.
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:09.000]   "Then he brought me back to the door of the temple,
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.120]   "and behold, water was issuing from below,"
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.560]   very much like there was rivers flowing
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.400]   in the garden of Eden,
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.820]   "Waters was issuing from below
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:21.020]   "and the threshold of the temple toward the east,
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:24.120]   "for the temple faced east."
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.240]   But the most significant detail
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.200]   that is shared between the temple and the garden
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.440]   is the manifestation of God's presence.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.680]   First Kings chapter eight, verse 10 through 11,
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.760]   it says, "And when the priest came out of the holy place,
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.640]   "a cloud filled the house of the Lord.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.420]   "So the priest could not stand to minister
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.260]   "because of the cloud,
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:41.960]   "for the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord."
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.200]   Now, if you remember from what I said before,
[01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:45.300]   the biblical idea of rest includes two elements,
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:48.660]   a perfect creation epitomized in the garden of Eden,
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:50.720]   and man's communion with God.
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.720]   The land of Canaan, with all its fertility and fruitfulness,
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.760]   was a picture of the divine garden
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.600]   epitomized in the temple,
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:00.780]   where God manifested his presence before the people
[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:03.040]   through the intermediary ministry
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.080]   of the priest and the high priest.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.360]   And so the reason why God calls the land of Canaan
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:11.160]   his place of rest is because it is a faint shadow
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:15.720]   and an image of paradise lost, a picture of Eden.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:18.700]   And so the psalmist says the following
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:20.200]   about the temple of God.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.880]   In Psalm 132, verse seven through eight,
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:24.000]   "Let us go to his dwelling place.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.040]   "Let us worship at his footstool.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.700]   "Arise, O Lord, and go to your resting place,
[01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:30.640]   "you and the ark of your might."
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:34.480]   What the Bible is trying to present
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:38.840]   is a story that connects the idea of national redemption
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.960]   to the resting place of God.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:44.080]   The nation of Israel was redeemed by a blood of a lamb
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.160]   to embark upon a wilderness journey
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.040]   to the Edenic lands of Canaan
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:52.240]   to commune with God in his place of rest.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:55.880]   And this isn't just some fanciful stuff I'm making up.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:58.040]   The scripture makes this connection for us.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.980]   Take your Bibles and turn with me to the book of Exodus.
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:03.100]   Exodus chapter 20.
[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:05.680]   Exodus 20.
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:09.100]   This is with the giving of the 10 commandments from Moses.
[01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:10.380]   From God through Moses.
[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.420]   Exodus chapter 20, verse eight through 11.
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:27.160]   Verse eight, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.100]   "Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:32.180]   "but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God.
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:34.040]   "On it you shall not do any work,
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.660]   "you or your son or your daughter,
[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:37.620]   "your male servants or your female servant
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:39.260]   "or your livestock or the sojourner
[01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:40.680]   "who is within your gates.
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:44.740]   "For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth,
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:46.520]   "the sea and all that is in them,
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.220]   "and rested on the seventh day.
[01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.800]   "Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.700]   "and made it holy."
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.880]   The reason why the ark should rest on the seventh day
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:55.660]   is because God rested on the seventh day.
[01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:56.500]   Yes?
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:57.380]   Pretty simple, okay?
[01:09:57.380 --> 01:09:59.460]   Take your Bibles, turn with me to the book of Deuteronomy.
[01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:00.740]   Deuteronomy chapter five.
[01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:07.780]   Deuteronomy chapter five, verse 12 to 15.
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:10.520]   (pages rustling)
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:27.920]   Listen to what it says, verse 12.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.620]   "Observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy,
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:33.140]   "as the Lord your God commanded you.
[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:35.780]   "Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:39.020]   "but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God.
[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.480]   "Honor you shall not do any work,
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.960]   "you or your son or your daughters
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.060]   "or your male servants or your female servants
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:47.560]   "or your ox or your donkey or any of your livestock
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.680]   "or the sojourner who is within your gates,
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.400]   "that your male servants and your female servants
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.640]   "may rest as well as you."
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.160]   Now listen to verse 15.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.800]   "You shall remember that you were a slave
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.280]   "in the land of Egypt,
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:00.020]   "and the Lord your God brought you out from there
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:02.700]   "with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:04.200]   "Therefore the Lord your God commanded you
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:05.720]   "to keep the Sabbath day."
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:09.800]   Why are they to keep the Sabbath day in Deuteronomy?
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:14.460]   In order to remember the redemption from captivity.
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:16.960]   I remember when I first read these texts,
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:17.940]   it didn't make any sense to me.
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.540]   Why was Moses giving two completely different reasons
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:22.600]   for why the Israelites had to observe the Sabbath?
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.480]   The book of Exodus, they had to rest on the Sabbath day
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.320]   because God rested after the seventh day
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.760]   after creating the entire world.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.160]   The book of Deuteronomy, they had to rest
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:31.560]   in order to remember the redemption
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.500]   from the nation of Egypt.
[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:36.100]   So how were the two related?
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:38.300]   And so from a cursory read,
[01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:41.140]   it might seem like Moses is giving two unrelated reasons
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:43.540]   for why Israel had to observe the Sabbath.
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:46.420]   But remember, Moses was a theologian.
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:47.500]   I think that's something that we forget.
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:51.140]   Remember, he's a prophet, but he is also a theologian.
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.880]   And within his mind,
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:55.220]   the reason that he gave in the book of Exodus,
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:57.260]   and the reason that he gives in the book of Deuteronomy,
[01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:59.500]   is intimately connected.
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:02.780]   Namely, that God had redeemed the nation of Israel
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:04.620]   from the bondage of slavery,
[01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:08.100]   to lead them to the Edenic lands of Canaan
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:10.300]   in memory of creation's paradise
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:14.180]   that was lost because of sin.
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:17.620]   That's the relationship between Exodus and Deuteronomy.
[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:20.660]   The authors of both the Old and New Testament
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:22.860]   take and develop the relationship of redemption and rest,
[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:26.060]   and they then apply this to our lives in the New Testament.
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:28.980]   And we come to our last point, heavenly rest.
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:30.340]   Heavenly rest.
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:31.580]   This is how the author of Hebrews
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.900]   is weaving all of these things together.
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:36.260]   He's not just randomly bringing a hodgepodge
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:39.500]   of thoughts together just because they share the same word.
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:42.740]   It's a theological truth he is weaving together
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:46.140]   from Genesis to Revelation with this concept of rest.
[01:12:46.140 --> 01:12:49.180]   In Hebrews chapter four, verse eight through 10,
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:50.020]   it says the following,
[01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:52.540]   "For Joshua had given them rest,
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:55.940]   "God would not have spoken of another day later on.
[01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:58.300]   "So then there remains a Sabbath rest
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:12:59.300]   "for the people of God,
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:01.260]   "for whoever has entered God's rest
[01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:04.500]   "has also rested from his works as God did from his."
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:08.940]   Israel's redemption from Egypt to the promised land of Canaan
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:11.820]   serves as a pattern,
[01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:16.460]   and like a grid by which we can understand
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:18.020]   our salvation experience.
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:20.700]   Flip to Romans chapter eight,
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.700]   Romans chapter eight, verse 14 to 17.
[01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:31.540]   Okay, listen to this, okay?
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.380]   Very carefully.
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:35.220]   Romans chapter eight, verse 14 to 17.
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:43.940]   "For all who are led by the Spirit of God
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:46.260]   "are sons of God.
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:47.860]   "For you did not receive the spirit of slavery
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:48.780]   "to fall back into fear,
[01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:51.860]   "but you have received the spirit of adoptions as sons,
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:54.300]   "by whom we cry, 'Abba, Father.'
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:56.260]   "The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit
[01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:57.340]   "that we are children of God,
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:58.460]   "and if children, then heirs,
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:00.660]   "heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ,
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:01.900]   "provided we suffer with him,
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:06.220]   "in order that we may also be glorified with him."
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:08.060]   We are heirs.
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:11.700]   This text, in this text,
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:13.820]   Paul uses Exodus language
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:16.620]   to describe our salvation experience.
[01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:19.500]   This is a common observation among commentators.
[01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:22.020]   Just as Israel was called the national son of God,
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:24.620]   so we are called the sons of God.
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:26.500]   Just as Israel was enslaved to Pharaoh,
[01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.340]   we were enslaved to sin.
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.220]   Just as they were led by the Shekinah glory,
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:32.660]   we are led by the Spirit of God.
[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:36.980]   Just as they were brought into the inheritance of Abraham,
[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:40.860]   we are partakers and heirs with Christ,
[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:43.060]   the recipients of the inheritance of Jesus.
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:45.820]   And then look at verse 18,
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:47.720]   look at verse 18, Romans chapter eight.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:51.180]   For I consider the sufferings,
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:52.540]   that the sufferings of this present time
[01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:53.820]   are not worth comparing with the glory
[01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:55.940]   that is to be revealed to us.
[01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:57.460]   For the creation waits with eager longing
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:59.620]   for the revealing of the sons of God.
[01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:01.520]   But the creation was subjected to futility,
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:03.980]   not willingly, but because of him who subjected it
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:06.340]   in hope that the creation itself
[01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:08.860]   will be set free from its bondage to corruption
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:10.780]   and obtain the freedom of the glory
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:12.420]   of the children of God.
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:13.640]   But we know that the whole creation
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:14.700]   has been groaning together
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:16.780]   in the pains of childbirth until now.
[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:18.120]   And not only the creation,
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:20.500]   but we ourselves who are the first fruits of the Spirit
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:24.540]   groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoptions as sons,
[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:26.400]   the redemption of our bodies.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:29.320]   When you notice that,
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.400]   right after Paul talks about the spiritual exodus,
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:34.040]   he's talking about the restoration of creation.
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:37.200]   And he's not randomly changing subjects here.
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.720]   Sometimes we just think that.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.800]   He's just randomly changing topics.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.760]   Again, they are interconnected.
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:45.080]   The same way that the nation of Israel
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.840]   was redeemed from captivity
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:48.200]   and brought through the wilderness
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:50.280]   to the Edenic lands of Canaan,
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:54.060]   so we who have been redeemed from captivity to sin
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:56.860]   will one day cross the Jordan of death
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:59.540]   and enter into a creation that will be restored
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:02.580]   from the corruption of sin.
[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:05.300]   Our Christian life is an exodus journey
[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:08.260]   from our former days of bondage to the lands of rest
[01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:11.220]   in the restored creation of God.
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:13.340]   And the scripture teaches that the final state of land
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:14.680]   in which we find our rest
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:16.960]   will not just be a restored creation,
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.020]   but an entirely new creation,
[01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:20.960]   a new heaven and a new earth
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:24.520]   where the whole world will in fact be Edenic.
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.920]   In Revelation chapter 21 verse one, it says,
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.280]   "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.800]   "from the first heaven and the first earth had passed away,
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:34.120]   "and the sea was no more."
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.320]   In chapter 22 of Revelation verse one through two,
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.680]   it says, "Then the angel showed me the river
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:41.280]   "of the water of life, bright as crystal,
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:44.220]   "flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:46.360]   "through the middle of the street of the city,
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.640]   "also on either side of the river,
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.780]   "the tree of life with its 12 kinds of fruits
[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:53.260]   "yielding its fruit each month.
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:56.180]   "The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
[01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:59.500]   "Just as rivers and waters nourish the land of fertility
[01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.280]   "in the first Eden, so the rivers will flow
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:04.080]   "from the throne of God to give life in the new creation.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.200]   "And the tree that was taken away from Adam
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.000]   "in the first creation will return
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.380]   "and be given to those who are in Christ,
[01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:11.760]   "that is the second Adam.
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.860]   "And in that place, humanity will once again
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:16.780]   "commune with God, but not through a veil,
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:18.940]   "not through the intermediary ministry
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:20.480]   "of the priest or the high priest,
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:21.820]   "but we will commune with God
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:23.720]   "the same way that Adam communed with God,
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.660]   "and that is face to face."
[01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:27.620]   Revelation chapter 21, verse two to three says,
[01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:30.300]   "And I saw a holy city, the new Jerusalem,
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:32.500]   "coming down out of heaven from God,
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.660]   "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
[01:17:34.660 --> 01:17:36.240]   "And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:40.660]   "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man.
[01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:43.080]   "He will dwell with them, and they will be his people,
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.580]   "and God himself will be with them as their God."
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:47.780]   This is the final rest for Christians,
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:49.540]   the rest in the second creation,
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:52.380]   the rest after our wilderness journey in this world.
[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:57.020]   That's what we look forward to.
[01:17:57.020 --> 01:18:01.820]   But the staggering reality of the promise
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:03.580]   is that even on this day,
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:06.020]   even though as Christians we should be looking forward
[01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:08.180]   to the day when we will be with our Savior,
[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:11.540]   we experience that rest even now today.
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:14.860]   Remember, it was sin that ruined
[01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:16.140]   the Edenic paradise of creation
[01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:18.700]   and plunged the world into restlessness.
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:19.860]   The toil that we suffer right now
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:22.060]   is not because of sin,
[01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:24.700]   it's the bondage of sin, the oppression of sin,
[01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.540]   the hopelessness wrought by sin,
[01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:28.900]   death wrought by sin, damnation wrought by sin.
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:31.220]   It was Christ who came into this world
[01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:33.800]   to deliver us from our enslavement to sin
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.140]   as the second Moses,
[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:36.820]   a prophet that is greater than the first,
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:38.420]   Deuteronomy 18, verse 18,
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:40.860]   to lead us in a second exodus to the land of promise,
[01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:42.260]   the holy residence of God,
[01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:45.180]   because Christ will be the one who bears our transgressions.
[01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:47.720]   He upon the cross will be slaughtered as the Passover lamb
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:50.660]   so that through the blood of the Son of God,
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:53.340]   the wrath of God might pass over us
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:55.660]   and be poured out upon the Son,
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:56.980]   and that through Jesus Christ,
[01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:58.900]   we might be brought into the land of promise,
[01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.500]   not just a final place in heaven,
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:02.960]   but to a place of communion in this present time.
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:07.980]   The power of the gospel
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:12.240]   brings future realities into the present.
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:15.160]   That's incredible.
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:20.480]   The power of the gospel brings future promises and realities
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:23.380]   that we might have a foretaste of it now in the present.
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:27.740]   God, by uniting us with his resurrected life,
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:30.160]   he has made us a new creation.
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:33.280]   New creation, as we read,
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:36.000]   should have been something in the future,
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.760]   something that happens when the Son of God comes back.
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:42.160]   But by the grace of God in union with the Son of God,
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:44.400]   we are made to experience that new creation in ourselves.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.080]   Second Corinthians chapter five verse 17,
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:48.400]   "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.740]   "The old has passed, behold, the new has come."
[01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:54.660]   And we know that the temple of God,
[01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:56.820]   the tabernacle of God was made to be a picture
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:20:00.060]   of the first creation, to capture the beauty of Eden.
[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:03.660]   And the Lord calls us now the temple of God.
[01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:04.960]   First Corinthians chapter three verse 16,
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:06.640]   "Do you not know that you are God's temple
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.120]   "and that God's spirit dwells in you?
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.560]   "And just as Adam saw the glory of God
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:12.360]   "in the garden of Eden, and just as the high priest
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.580]   "in the temple saw the glory of God in the holy of holies,
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:16.820]   "we see the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:18.440]   "in the gospel."
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:19.680]   Second Corinthians chapter four verse six,
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:21.500]   "For God who said, 'Let light shine out of darkness,'
[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.560]   "has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:26.200]   "of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:30.040]   The Bible promises a future day of rest,
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:34.960]   but in Christ we have already experienced that rest in him,
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.280]   though not yet fully.
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:41.780]   And so our Lord says in Matthew chapter 11 verse 28,
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:45.960]   "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden,
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:48.480]   "and I will give you rest."
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:53.760]   Our Lord understood what that word meant.
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:57.480]   He understood what it meant in the past,
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:59.560]   and he knew the implications for the future,
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.040]   that term rest.
[01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:04.180]   He says, "Come to me, and I will give you rest."
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:07.040]   You've been ravaged by sin.
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:11.040]   You've experienced the pains of death.
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.020]   You suffered.
[01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:15.360]   Your relationships have been strained.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.620]   "Come to me, and I will give you rest.
[01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:20.980]   "Come to me, for I bore your sins.
[01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:23.420]   "I was damned in your place.
[01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:27.920]   "Come to me, for I will reconcile you to the God
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.280]   "with whose relationship you have been severed.
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:33.400]   "Come to me, and I will give you rest."
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:37.320]   (audience members applauding)
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:42.320]   - You know, back in 2020,
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:46.680]   this teaching of rest especially pressed itself
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:47.520]   upon my heart.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:52.720]   That year was so, it was unbelievable.
[01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:57.540]   Sometimes I still can't believe that it actually happened.
[01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:00.880]   The world was in panic mode.
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:04.520]   It seemed like every nation was in a frenzy.
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.040]   And then within our own nation,
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:08.760]   there was a social and political unrest.
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:10.040]   The death of George Floyd,
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:12.140]   the protests and the riots on the streets,
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:18.400]   the debate of BLM, the defund of police in 2020 elections.
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:21.500]   Sadly, even churches splintered.
[01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:25.680]   They became divided over issues of mass COVID policies
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:27.440]   and political views.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:30.520]   Then being, all of this was happening outside,
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:33.020]   and even within my home, I felt so restless.
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:36.120]   Couldn't go out, and I'm sure like many of you,
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:37.160]   you had Zoom fatigue.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.760]   I remember thinking, man, I can't wait
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:41.960]   until things go back to normal.
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:43.520]   Things go back to normal, I can go outside,
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:45.760]   spend time with my family and my friends,
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.360]   have a normal church service.
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.680]   I was looking forward to the future
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:51.840]   when all of the chaos would come to a rest.
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:54.880]   And praise God to a degree that it did.
[01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:58.420]   I feel like things more or less came back to normal.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.200]   But just as it was before the pandemic,
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:03.840]   old problems resurfaced and new problems rose up.
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:07.600]   Like traffic just coming back on the five in the 405.
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:12.680]   Stress at work ramps up, student loans resume.
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:15.840]   Some of you may have been hit with financial difficulties,
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:18.000]   especially because of the inflation.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.040]   I know we had the tech layoffs.
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:21.640]   There's anticipation of recession.
[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:24.360]   Then there's the relational issues that are independent,
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.760]   maybe, of the circumstances around us,
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:28.960]   the personal problems through which we struggle.
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.000]   And you realize that even though things go back to normal,
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.820]   what is normal is still a state of unrest.
[01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:38.560]   And you realize that no matter how much rest
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.920]   you get on Earth, it's never gonna be enough.
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:45.280]   Summer after finals might seem like a time of rest,
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:47.840]   but you know that it's not ultimately.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:49.800]   The return to normalcy after lockdown.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:52.560]   How many of you are restless?
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:55.260]   Two weeks of vacation after months of work,
[01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:56.640]   retirement after a life of work,
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:57.760]   there'll always be something missing,
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.880]   always something wrong, something empty.
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:02.000]   The thorns and thistles of the fall
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.480]   will continue to poke in the prick
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:04.320]   while you're on this Earth,
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.800]   no matter how good things might be.
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:09.100]   These things are a reminder to you
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:10.720]   that you are not meant to find your rest
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.180]   in your home in a wilderness.
[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:16.280]   You're meant to find your home and your rest in heaven.
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:17.120]   With God.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:21.200]   And what a joy it is that Christ gives you
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:22.240]   that rest even now.
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:26.520]   All of you who are weary and heavy laden,
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:31.580]   burdened by your guilt, sin, shame,
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:36.080]   stressed at work, maybe a relationship,
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:38.000]   families breaking apart,
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.680]   and you just don't know what to do.
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:42.320]   And how many people try to escape
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:44.080]   from those things to worldly means?
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:47.940]   Christ is the one who says, "I will give you rest.
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:51.000]   "I will save your souls.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.240]   "I'll strengthen you to endure.
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:56.340]   "I'll remind you the hope of what awaits.
[01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:59.560]   "Through me you will see and experience
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:00.720]   "the rest that is to come,
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:02.880]   "for even now in the midst of chaos,
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:05.440]   "you will know a peace that transcends all understanding,
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:07.940]   "but you have to come to me," he says.
[01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:11.280]   So what is holding you back?
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:13.380]   Come to him.
[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:16.600]   For our Lord Jesus Christ is the place of rest.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:18.640]   Let's pray.
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:22.920]   Dear Father,
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:25.160]   (thumping)
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:31.200]   God, what a powerful and loaded term, rest.
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:39.760]   God, what a appropriate and relevant term.
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:44.300]   I feel like so many of us are tired,
[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:48.320]   tired at work, tired of conflict,
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:52.560]   this burden, my day-to-day responsibilities.
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:57.040]   Even in times of vacations, we can be exhausted.
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.940]   Some of us, maybe our health is failing.
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:05.220]   And our hearts, as a result,
[01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:10.960]   feels like it's in a state of tumult, of chaos.
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:16.200]   But Jesus, it's for that very reason you came to save us.
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:20.960]   You came into this wilderness of fallen creation,
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:24.560]   a place that is governed by the devil,
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:25.600]   the God of this world.
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:30.040]   And you, Lord Jesus Christ, subjected yourself
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:33.600]   to suffering, condemnation, death,
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:38.520]   so that you might sanctify us and deliver us
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:43.240]   from the present age of darkness to the kingdom of light,
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:47.760]   to give us rest in the presence of God Almighty.
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:53.120]   Lord, we give you glory, we give you praise.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:55.880]   Again, I pray for my brothers and sisters here
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:58.160]   that they would remember that in you,
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:01.040]   Lord, they can be content, they can do all things.
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:04.800]   In you, they can strive and fight,
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:07.040]   for when we are weak, we are strong.
[01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:10.360]   In you, we have a hope
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:13.360]   that surpasses the hopelessness in this world,
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:15.640]   a hope of being with you forever.
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:17.920]   And God, I pray for those who do not know you,
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:20.440]   that the beauty of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:23.000]   would draw them, and that they would find
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.520]   that true rest in you, Son of God,
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:28.520]   our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:30.200]   We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:35.920]   - I invite you guys to stand for our closing praise.
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:40.280]   And as we sing this, it will be a response
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:42.920]   to the word that was preached.
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:47.000]   And let's meditate on the words that we sing
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:53.040]   and reflect on what was taught today.
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:53.880]   And so.
