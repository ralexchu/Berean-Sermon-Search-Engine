[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Okay, if you can turn your Bibles to Romans chapter 12 verses 1 and 2.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.200]   Again, this is kind of part 2, but really today we're going to be focusing on the subject
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.200]   of Thanksgiving sacrifice as we're preparing ourselves for the Thanksgiving break.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.840]   Romans chapter 12, really on 1, and I'm just going to stemming off from the last part of
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.880]   this passage, Romans chapter 12, but I'll read both passages.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.920]   I appeal to you therefore brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.840]   a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.400]   Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:47.400]   by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.480]   Let's pray.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.760]   Gracious and loving Father, we want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.760]   For all the things that we know, and even the things that we are not aware of, the things
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.200]   that you are doing in our lives, Lord God.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.240]   We thank you so much, Father, for being patient.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.840]   We thank you for your constant reminder through the Holy Spirit and intercession that we may
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.680]   draw near to the throne of grace.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.460]   We may have confidence based upon who you are and what you have done.
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.220]   I pray that this morning that you would remind us again of who you are, that we may worship
[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.040]   you to offer our bodies as a living sacrifice, as a reasonable spiritual act of worship.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.560]   We thank you in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.720]   Amen.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.200]   The last part of last week's sermon, at the end of chapter 12, verse 1, he says to offer
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.640]   your bodies in view of God's mercy as a living sacrifice, this is your spiritual act of worship.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.840]   And we found out that at the end of that verse, the NASB has that translated, not spiritual,
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.080]   but reasonable or logical.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.640]   And I think the literal understanding of that word spiritual that's in ESV, it just means
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.160]   that this is the reasonable response to what we confess to believe.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.040]   The reasonable response to justification is our sanctification, that we offer our bodies
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.500]   as a living sacrifice.
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.360]   And this is our logical act of worship.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.880]   So basically what Paul is saying is, if we confess that these things are true, and that
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.760]   we've genuinely been affected by the blood of the cross, the only reasonable response
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.520]   is to offer our bodies, our whole bodies as a living sacrifice.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.800]   It would only make sense.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.360]   It would be unreasonable to profess Christ as our savior, that God sent his only begotten
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.880]   son to die for us, and that our reward is in heaven to be in eternity to worship him,
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.760]   and then his eternal damnation for rejecting him, to confess the belief of that, and to
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.040]   live the rest of our life as if that never happened.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.400]   It is unreasonable.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.800]   So it is not simply because the scripture teaches it that this is what a Christian should
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.520]   look like, it is just a natural response.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:07.640]   And those of you who've ever been around a brand new Christian who confessed their sins,
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.200]   you don't need to tell them.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.720]   In fact, they're the ones asking, "What should I do?
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.620]   How should I respond?"
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.360]   And some of you guys probably may remember that.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.080]   Maybe you were like that when you first became a Christian, came to church asking, "What
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.400]   do I now need to do?
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.400]   Where do I sit?
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.680]   How do I dress?"
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.480]   Because automatically it was understood, if Christ purchased me for himself, I belong
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.760]   to him, then what does God desire?
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.280]   So that's how Paul ends verse 1 with saying that offering your bodies as a living sacrifice
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.360]   is a reasonable response of worship to God.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.080]   Lordship is not an option in the church for a Christian.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.200]   Lordship is a logical response to God.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.540]   And the reason why we have this theological term, "Lordship salvation," is to clarify
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.040]   that a Christian isn't a Christian until Christ is actually your Lord.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.160]   He didn't just save us so that we don't go to hell.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.440]   The scripture says he purchased us for himself.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.640]   That we no longer belong to ourselves, but we belong to him for his purpose, for his
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.140]   use.
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.160]   In fact, in Romans 10, verse 9, it says, "If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.120]   Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, then you will be saved."
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.720]   So this idea of Christ being Lord is not an option for a few select Christians.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.000]   For some people who decide to go into ministry or to go out to missions, that we somehow
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.080]   struggle with this idea of, "I'm going to dedicate my whole life to Christ," and then
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.040]   those who don't go into ministry somehow is exempt from that.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.360]   Some Christians have decided to dedicate everything to God, and then the rest of us have decided,
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.560]   "Well, we're going to give some to God, and some I'm going to live for myself."
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.120]   That is not the option that a Christian has.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.880]   The Christian from the very get-go, his own salvation, it says, "If you confess Christ
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.180]   as your Lord," meaning Christ didn't just forgive your sins, he purchased us, that we
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.800]   belong to him.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.320]   But obviously, Paul is not saying, "Those who confess with your mouth, who knows how
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.040]   to say those words, will be saved."
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.800]   Jesus himself says in Matthew 7, 21, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.440]   enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.860]   So obviously, Paul's not just talking about somebody who's able to articulate those words,
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.800]   but that he means it and he practices it.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.240]   That he who finds his life outside of Christ, he'll actually lose it.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:46.280]   So if you think about it, our whole pursuit of happiness that this country puts on a pedestal
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.560]   is actually, according to Scripture, a pursuit of death, according to what Jesus says.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.160]   He saved us so that we may belong to him.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.460]   And so, when we come, when we come to Romans 12, verse 1, when he says, "A reasonable response
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.000]   to the grace of God is to offer our bodies as a living sacrifice."
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.880]   But he spent 11 chapters telling us that the sacrifice has been made in Christ.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.000]   That whatever was necessary for us to get to God, Christ bridged the gap by his own
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   sacrifice.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.200]   So what does he mean in chapter 1, chapter 12, when he says, "To offer your body as a
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.040]   living sacrifice."
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:29.240]   Well, all of the Old Testament sacrifices can be put into two major categories.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.480]   You have the free will offering and then you have the mandatory offering.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:40.680]   Mandatory offerings was commanded by God and if you did not obey, there will be consequences.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.480]   Meaning that the government of Israel will recognize that there's sin that you are not
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.880]   atoning for and there will be consequences for that.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.800]   And then the free will offering is also commanded.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.240]   Free will offering doesn't mean that you can do it or not do it.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.480]   It is also commanded, but God desires that the free will offering be given from the abundance
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.720]   of your heart.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:07.940]   And it is required, but it is voluntary.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:13.800]   All the offerings of the Old Testament can be categorized into five categories that the
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.800]   Bible mentions.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.920]   And it's in the beginning of the book of Leviticus.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.600]   There's a few of you who were with us when I went through the book of Leviticus years
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.600]   ago.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.520]   It's been about 15 years now that we went through the book of Leviticus.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.920]   I'm kind of debating that after we finish Revelation that we're going to tackle Leviticus
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.120]   again in the weekday Bible study.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.400]   I'm not 100 percent.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.400]   I'm leaning toward that.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.400]   Maybe 80, 90 percent.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.640]   We're going to jump into the book of Leviticus.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.120]   But Leviticus sets the foundation of understanding of the sacrifices, ultimately fulfilled in
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:50.080]   Christ, but also the free will offering that God desires in sanctification.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.600]   The five offerings that's mentioned in the book of Leviticus is the whole offering, sometimes
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.680]   it's called the burnt offering, it's called the grain offering, peace offering, sin offering,
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.680]   trespass offering.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:06.280]   Of the five, the last two, the sin offering and trespass offering was mandatory.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:11.400]   So if there was inadvertent sin or certain type of sins that God required, you were required
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.000]   to bring atoning sacrifice.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.560]   Trespass offering is when you wrong somebody else, when you damage their goods.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.960]   Then God required that you compensate, that you would offer a certain sacrifice and then
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:28.440]   certain amount of whatever you destroyed or took, that you have to compensate and you
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.640]   have to pay them back.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.800]   Those two offerings were mandatory.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:39.040]   But when the scripture talks about in the New Testament in chapter 12, to offer your
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.040]   bodies a living sacrifice, mandatory offering was fulfilled in Christ.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.280]   So there is nothing that we need more to get to Christ.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:52.640]   So when we talk about sanctification, which is what chapter 12 through 16 is, is in reference
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:58.400]   to the free will offering where God desires in light of his mercy, in light of his grace,
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.240]   to respond in worship.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.960]   But again, he desires voluntary worship and we talked about that last week.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.880]   But it does not mean that there is no structure.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.400]   Even though it is voluntary, he did command it.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.480]   So the first three offerings, the whole offering, grain offering, and priest offering, it lays
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:24.260]   the foundation in which we understand what God desires from us in our worship.
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.440]   So we are going to look at that this morning, these first three offerings.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.160]   The first one is the whole offering.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.200]   It is called the burnt offering.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.520]   So the first of the free will offering is the burnt offering or the whole offering,
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:41.140]   which is exposited or talked about in Leviticus chapter 1.
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:46.440]   So the cause of this worship, the reason behind this worship is the general atonement of our
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.440]   sins.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.960]   It is not anything particular.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.640]   It is not because we recognize I did something wrong.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.360]   Generally understanding that we are in need of atonement and God fulfills that through
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.680]   the sacrifice.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.600]   It is the only offering that is completely consumed.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.240]   And again, why it is called the whole offering.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.200]   No part of the sacrifice was to be reserved for consumption.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.760]   So a lot of the offering that you gave to the temple, some of it was reserved for the
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:19.800]   priest, it was reserved for other use, but this particular offering was to be complete
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.800]   completely.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.200]   Nothing was saved at all.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.120]   Again, the whole offering or burnt offering.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:31.320]   It is the most common offering that is mentioned in the Old Testament, mentioned 197 times.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:37.280]   It is the first offering that we hear about in the book of Genesis, chapter 8, verse 20.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:42.360]   And again, it indicates a complete consumption.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:48.880]   When Paul says here to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, the term living sacrifice
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.720]   itself is an oxymoron.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.200]   Because a sacrifice by nature means it is dead.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:03.280]   So to say to give a living sacrifice, meaning to offer what is dead as living.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.960]   It is like saying jumbo shrimp.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.880]   It is an oxymoron.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:13.040]   So these two terms on the surface seem to be a contradiction.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:18.040]   But that is exactly what Paul means, and that is exactly what God means in chapter 12, that
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:25.480]   our lives, first and foremost, must die in order for us to live.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:32.100]   That is why for every single Christian, the first act of obedience is baptism.
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:37.920]   Because baptism is the beginning of our relationship where we recognize that we are crucified with
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.600]   Christ.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:45.500]   So before we can live our lives as a sacrifice, we need to first and foremost die with Christ.
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:51.360]   So this first offering that we are referring to is a complete consumption of our life in
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.560]   dedication to God.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:59.080]   Not just our weekends, not just a portion of our lives, not just when we are young,
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:04.400]   not just when we are in college, but every part of our lives is to be consumed for His
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.080]   glory.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.840]   And anything that comes short of that is defective.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.600]   Galatians 2.20 says, "I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.720]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.680]   In the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.480]   gave himself up for me."
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:29.280]   So the first act of obedience, the first act of worship to God is absolute, complete surrender.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.600]   This is not just for the pastors.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.400]   This is not just for the missionaries.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.880]   Some people again tend to think, as God called you into ministry, to think that somehow people
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.160]   who have gone into full-time ministry have decided to completely dedicate themselves
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.600]   to God and the rest of the congregation partially dedicated themselves to God.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.600]   The only difference between me and you is the avenue in which we have decided to live
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.160]   our lives to glorify God.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:00.120]   If you're a businessman, that is the avenue that God has called to glorify God all of
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.380]   your life.
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.920]   Everything that you have to glorify through that avenue.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.660]   That's the only distinction.
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:11.160]   God does not call some for complete obedience and some partial obedience.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:17.960]   All of us, when we were justified in Christ, were also crucified and was also buried with
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.600]   men and is no longer our lives.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:27.760]   It is that first step of recognizing that it is no longer our lives.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:35.240]   It is that first step where we recognize and establish Him as Lord over our lives that
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:39.720]   is necessary for all the other things that we do.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:45.880]   Again Philippians 121, Paul says, "Sitting in prison, for to me to live is Christ and
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.680]   to die is gain."
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:55.200]   Paul recognized that his old life, whatever he was before he met Christ, was crucified
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   with him on the road to Damascus when he met him.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.000]   From that day on, it was no longer his passion.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.520]   It was no longer his life to pursue.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.160]   So when he's sitting in prison, how can a man who's sitting in prison and some people
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.800]   actually even preaching the gospel to put pressure on him out of envy and rivalry and
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.560]   he says, "I praise God."
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.560]   Will they do it out of envy or rivalry that the gospel is being preached?
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:24.760]   And he's sitting in prison possibly facing, beheading, and he's concerned about this Gentile
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:31.360]   church in Philippi, which just a few years before, he hated the Gentiles.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.160]   And yet there's such radical transformation that took place in his heart.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.420]   He's sitting in prison worried about them.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:44.940]   He says, "Don't worry about me, for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain."
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.520]   He already died.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:51.640]   So that life that he's living now between the moment he met Christ until he actually
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:56.200]   physically dies is actually gain for him.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:01.240]   Again in Revelation chapter 117, whenever an individual is confronted by the glory of
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:07.040]   God, the immediate recognition is as they fell down as if dead.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:16.480]   Revelation 117, when John saw him, "I fell at his feet as though dead."
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:21.520]   True worship begins with absolute surrender.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.240]   That's what justification is.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:28.280]   Our sins have been justified and we have been purchased to establish him as Lord over our
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.280]   lives.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:37.360]   The primary rebellion that we see in the book of Genesis, our primary rebellion is to try
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.800]   to find life outside of God.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:46.560]   Giving glory to creation rather than to glory to God.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:53.760]   A Christian who is unsurrendered in his life is refusing to accept glory that belongs to
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.760]   God.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.760]   He wants some of that.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.160]   He wants to be at the center.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.600]   He wants to find life.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:06.620]   So the first step of true worship is establishing Christ as Lord in every aspect of our lives.
[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.920]   In Matthew 22, 37 it said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.920]   with all your soul, and with all your mind."
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:19.720]   Sometimes we get caught up with the technicalities of what it means to serve God with all your
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.240]   heart, what it means to love God with your mind, what it means to love God with your
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.640]   soul.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.720]   But I think the point of what Jesus is trying to make is not the mind, soul, and heart,
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:33.560]   although it is part of it, but the real emphasis here is all.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.840]   All of it.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.440]   You mean my finances?
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.440]   All of it.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.440]   You mean when I'm young?
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.440]   All of it.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.440]   Even when I'm older?
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.440]   All of it.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.500]   Every aspect of our lives now belongs to him.
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:53.400]   Every Christian must confess that we are crucified with Christ.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:17:00.480]   So much of our Christian frustration is because we live between two worlds.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.120]   There's a part of us that comes to church and wants to honor God and serve him, and
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.800]   we want the blessings of God, and we pray for that.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.960]   We pray that God will bless us and answer our prayers, and then we live the rest of
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:18.440]   the week coveting and desiring the things of this world, and we are torn because we
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.740]   are not completely consumed with one thing.
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:27.920]   First and foremost, God calls us in complete surrender to him.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:33.160]   If we really want to live in Christ, we must first die to ourselves.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.120]   Die to our ambition.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.120]   Die to our glory.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.440]   Die to our life.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.440]   Die to our future.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.320]   Die to whatever hope that we had before we met Christ.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:48.120]   Joshua 22.5, it says, "Only be very careful to observe the commandments and the law that
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.200]   Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, to love the Lord your God, and to walk in
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.120]   all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cling to him, and to serve him with
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:00.320]   all your heart and with all your soul."
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.040]   What Jesus said was not new.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.520]   This was the same in the Old Testament.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.880]   This is what he required of the Old Testament saints.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.880]   All of it.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:17.720]   Jeremiah 29.13, "You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart."
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.680]   Take a step back, and I know that's a passage that I quote quite a bit.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.920]   Take a step back before we just like, "Oh, I know that passage."
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:31.560]   We know what it means, but is that who you are?
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.040]   Are we really seeking the Lord with all our heart?
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.840]   Or is it a part-time endeavor?
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.800]   Is this something that we do when we're at church, but when we're at work, we put on
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.160]   a different mindset?
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:49.260]   The first offering that God desires from us is absolute, complete surrender.
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.680]   So that's what he means as a living sacrifice.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:58.040]   That we must first die before we can make any sacrifices.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:04.780]   You may have surrendered yourselves, but may not have surrendered your family.
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:10.240]   You may have surrendered your tithe, but not the rest of your wealth.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:15.080]   You may have surrendered your spare time, but not your vacation or your weeknights.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.320]   You may have surrendered your college life, but then once you start working and have freedom
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:24.620]   and money, you may have surrendered your singleness.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:31.780]   I remember when I was younger, before I entered into ministry, the idea of coming into full-time
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:36.580]   ministry in my mind meant that I'm not going to touch money, at least enough money that
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:41.380]   I thought that I was going to have in order to take care of my parents.
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:45.460]   Because we didn't grow up in a wealthy home, and there was always things that we lacked,
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.620]   and our Christmas presents were always socks, underwear, and pants.
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:49.620]   You know what I mean?
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.500]   Because we just didn't have money to get it.
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.620]   So it was like a big deal to get pants.
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.740]   And so growing up, I think all three of us, we grew up thinking like, when we make enough
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.940]   money, we're going to take care of our parents, we're going to buy a house, we're going to
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.580]   do all these things for our parents.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.440]   But I knew that going into ministry, there's no money in it.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.580]   So it was a wrestling match.
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:15.540]   So I prayed before God, I said, "You know, I'm going to trust the Lord, that He's going
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.540]   to take care of them."
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.100]   And whatever ambition that I had, again, I thought, "This is not selfish, it's for my
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.540]   parents."
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:27.500]   But I thought I surrendered that when I decided to go into ministry.
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:31.980]   But even after I came into ministry, God confronted me with Lordship.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.180]   Because I had this idea of what it means to be in ministry.
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.740]   So I thought, you know what, I surrendered everything to God.
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:41.580]   And all of a sudden, to make a long story short, God started directing my path toward
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.620]   homeless ministry.
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.420]   And so in my mind, I had all these ideas of how I wanted to do campus ministry, and how
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.400]   I wanted to do mission work.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.720]   And then all of a sudden, again, I don't want to go into the details, but God started directing
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.380]   my path, possibly to do full-time work in the homeless ministry.
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.080]   And that didn't fit my idea.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.820]   I said, "Here am I, send me."
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.560]   And I had an idea what that meant.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.660]   And then the homeless ministry was not in that picture.
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:10.460]   In fact, I had other pastor friends telling me, "Peter, that's like, you know, it's noble,
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:14.300]   but if you do that, all these things are going to be forfeited."
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:20.460]   But I couldn't shake the idea, what if that's what God wants?
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.580]   Who am I going to say, "You know what, I want to serve God, and I've dedicated everything
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.580]   to God, but not this."
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:29.460]   And that's when I realized I wasn't fully surrendered.
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.020]   God made me deal with that.
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.300]   If that's what God desires, I have to be able to say, "Here am I, send me."
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:40.020]   So I thought, Esther and I, when we first met, you know, we thought like, we entered
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.460]   thinking we're going to do homeless ministry, we're going to have homeless people, we're
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.340]   going to live in a homeless shelter.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.780]   And so we thought, we're surrendered.
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.660]   We gave up everything to the Lord.
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:53.020]   And then we got married and had kids.
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.300]   And a whole different area of temptation opens up.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.300]   And I never thought about money, because I thank God, you know, I married Esther, and
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.140]   she's not materialistic.
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:10.540]   And so we are able to live with little means, and because, you know, I chose the right wife.
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.540]   You know?
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:18.060]   But it wasn't until I had a kid, and I was driving in the car, and I was driving a pickup
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:23.900]   truck with no air conditioning, and only, you know, manual, what do you call it, the
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.500]   windows up and down, only front seat.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.300]   And the only reason I was driving that is because I wasn't making enough money as a
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.740]   pastor, so I was washing cars.
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:37.220]   So I had this idea that if I made a little clip art and say that I'm going to wax your
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.100]   car for 20 bucks, that I could at least supplement my income, because I didn't have enough.
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.180]   So I just, literally a clip art that he used for the youth group, and I just put Pete's
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.180]   car wash on it.
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:51.180]   I started putting it on people's windows, and at that time, we just had beepers.
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.180]   You know?
[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.180]   So it would beep.
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:58.100]   To my surprise, I was getting a lot of calls, because I was doing it for 20 bucks, and I
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:03.060]   found out that the waxing cost like 80, 90 bucks, and I was doing it for 20, you know?
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.820]   And it probably wasn't even worth 20 bucks, what I did.
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.980]   But I was getting phone calls, and it was enough, enough to get us by for that period
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.620]   when I wasn't getting paid.
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:21.280]   And so, there was no temptation until I had an infant in my car, and I saw him sweating,
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:27.280]   and I was driving one time from LA back up to my house in Buena Park, and the thought
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.380]   entered into my mind, it's like, "Man, you're a lousy father."
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:36.220]   You know, all these infants are coming out of these sport expeditions, and you know,
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:40.180]   nice cars, and they're well taken care of, and I can't even afford an air conditioner
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.620]   in my truck.
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.700]   And he's sweating, and he's sitting, I'm pretty sure that was illegal back then, too.
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:51.100]   He was sitting in the front seat, you know?
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.540]   And you know, and it was a stick shift.
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.460]   So I couldn't, yeah, I couldn't protect him.
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.520]   If anything happened, like, he's completely exposed.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:03.140]   But Jeremy made it.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.140]   By his grace.
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:11.340]   See, up to that point, I thought I was completely surrendered.
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:16.140]   But another part of my life happens, and I realized it wasn't complete.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:20.980]   In every aspect of my life, God would bring something in and expose that Christ was Lord
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:25.260]   in certain areas, and then it would keep creeping back in.
[00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.820]   I wrestled with that in the early part of this church.
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.060]   I thought I completely surrendered.
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:34.520]   I was willing to do homeless ministry, and I was willing not to have money.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.700]   And then the first six, seven years of this church, the church didn't grow.
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.300]   Not that I was really focused on that at that time.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:46.260]   But because of that, financially it was difficult.
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.800]   And it was hard thinking like, "Okay, God, you know, I dedicated myself to the homeless
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.500]   ministry, but maybe God's taking me to another direction now, and maybe if I'm going to do
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:58.300]   this ministry, you know, I can really dedicate myself and bear fruit."
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.340]   And at least on the surface, there was no fruit.
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.420]   At least on the surface.
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.520]   And God made me deal with that.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.660]   Would you be okay with that?
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:11.680]   And it took, for whatever the reason, it took a long time for me to be okay with it.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:16.120]   If this is what you've called me, if this is my lot in life, I have to surrender.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:20.600]   Every aspect, every few years, it creeps back into my heart.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.220]   And I realized lordship is not something that you claim in the beginning of your walk with
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.320]   God and then I'm done.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:32.820]   Every aspect of our lives, God will search, "Am I completely surrendered?"
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:38.620]   See, the first act of worship to God is a constant surrendering to God.
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.620]   Is he really lord over everything?
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.740]   Or is he lord over certain things?
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:48.620]   The second free will offering is the grain offering, which is found in Leviticus chapter
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:49.820]   2.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.900]   The reason for this worship is God's blessing, his bounty.
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.100]   Typically when we think of Thanksgiving, like, "What are you thankful for?"
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.460]   We say, "I'm thankful for my job, I'm thankful we just got a new house."
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:03.920]   And all of these things are possibly God's blessing in our life.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:09.540]   So this grain offering was in response a free will offering to thank God.
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:12.220]   It's the only offering where there's no animal involved.
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:16.140]   It was whatever harvest that you had, you were to offer it up to God as a free will
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.940]   offering, as an act of worship.
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:25.060]   So the closest thing that you and I have in dedication is probably finance.
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:29.720]   Where our offering to God, our free will offering that we give to God, is an act of worship
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.720]   to God.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.260]   Not just giving money because it's required, but because God has blessed our lives.
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:40.780]   We acknowledge his lordship in our life as an act of worship to say, "This all belongs
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:41.780]   to you."
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:45.900]   Proverbs 3, 9-10 says, "Honor the Lord with your wealth and with the first fruits of your
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:50.500]   produce then your barns will be filled with plenty and your vats will be bursting with
[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:51.500]   wine."
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:56.180]   Again, in Exodus 22, 29, "You shall not delay to offer from the fullness of your harvest
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.500]   and from outflow of your presses."
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:05.900]   So these offerings are free will offerings and yet it was also commanded.
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:09.380]   So we think like, "Well if it's a free will offering, it's voluntary, then whether we
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.940]   do it or don't do it, it doesn't matter."
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.740]   That's not the case.
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:17.620]   He actually commands it, but in the manner in which we give, he wants us to do it voluntarily
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:18.620]   and cheerfully.
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:23.860]   Exodus 23, 19, "The best of the first fruits of your ground you shall bring into the houses
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.740]   of the Lord your God."
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:30.900]   And again, Paul reiterates something similar in 2 Corinthians 9, 6-8, "The point of this
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:36.460]   whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:42.580]   Each one must give as he has made up his mind, not reluctantly or under compulsion for God
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.460]   loves a cheerful giver.
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.380]   And God is able to make all grace abound to you so that having all sufficiency in all
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:54.340]   things at all times you may abound in every good work."
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.940]   Now there's a reason why I'm using this today and not having the mic up here because I'm
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:02.300]   going to walk off this pulpit and I'm going to hand out some money.
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:06.500]   So don't get excited.
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:11.940]   And so this is probably the most expensive illustrations I've ever given and thank God
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.260]   we don't have three services, we only have two.
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.740]   So I'm going to give you some money.
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.740]   Okay?
[00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.740]   You're going to...
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:18.740]   Alright.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.740]   Some of you guys feel dirty.
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.300]   I'm going to give you some money.
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.380]   Yes, just take it.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.380]   It's real.
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.380]   It's real money.
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.020]   It's not fake.
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.020]   Okay.
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:36.620]   Now the big stuff is coming down the middle.
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.620]   Alright?
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:44.500]   Alright.
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:45.500]   That's real money.
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.500]   Okay?
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:55.220]   Alright, I'm going to explain what that money is.
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.180]   Okay?
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:04.820]   That money is given to you and what I'm asking you to do with that is to use this week at
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:10.580]   some point, think of somebody that you think needs your encouragement.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:16.060]   So use that money to take them out to eat, buy them a gift or something, but use it for
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.340]   them.
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:23.460]   And if you don't want to do that, you say there's nobody I want to encourage, nobody
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:30.020]   deserves this, I refuse to do it, then put it back in the offering basket.
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.080]   Okay?
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.200]   So this is not for you.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.060]   This is for you to use to bless other people.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.060]   Right?
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:42.700]   Now, I'm assuming, I could be wrong, but I'm assuming that most of you are going to try
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:43.700]   to carry it out.
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.420]   Maybe you won't have time, but at least you're going to make an effort to do that.
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.140]   And the reason why is because it was given to you.
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.940]   That this wasn't your money.
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.780]   This was my money I gave to you and I'm asking you to do it.
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.260]   And I'm not going to collect it.
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.580]   Because right now I have no idea who I gave it to.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:02.300]   I just walked around randomly so some of you guys look happier than other people, so I'm
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.780]   assuming you got the money.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.980]   Right?
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:11.380]   But I'm assuming that those of you who receive the money are going to be able, or at least
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.260]   make an effort to bless somebody else.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:17.460]   And the reason why you're not going to be reluctant to do that is because you don't
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.860]   see that as your money, which it isn't.
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.460]   But why go through that channel?
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:29.460]   Because if you do that, the person that you bless with that will be blessed.
[00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:33.660]   You'll be blessed because you were able to do that for them.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.100]   And so you'll be blessed.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:41.180]   And then I'll be blessed because I see you loving one another.
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.520]   So all three of us are blessed.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:50.740]   As a pastor, if you ask me what's the greatest gift that you can give me, this may sound
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:57.060]   strange, and you may not believe me, but if you love one another and serve one another,
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:01.660]   because we're working so hard to get you to get along and genuinely love each other, if
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.860]   I see you guys doing that and serving each other, my heart is full.
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:07.660]   Because I feel like we're making progress.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:11.020]   So if I see you doing that, I will be blessed.
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:16.260]   So if you take what you have and give it to somebody else and bless them, all three of
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:19.240]   us are blessed.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:24.060]   But if you take that money, that's 20 bucks.
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.180]   That's two hours of babysitting.
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:31.660]   And you take that money and you hoard it to yourself, not only will you not be blessed,
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.940]   I won't be blessed, and the person that you could have blessed isn't blessed.
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:38.540]   And all three of us are discouraged.
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:43.820]   There's a reason why God gives us bountifully.
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:48.280]   Why he doesn't just kind of open up heaven and just pour out money.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.420]   Because he uses us as an avenue.
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:56.380]   And that's true, not just with finance, that's true even with evangelism.
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:00.020]   Because if God uses you to bring somebody else to Christ, they're blessed because of
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:04.020]   you, you're blessed because God used you, and God is blessed because you surrendered
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:07.540]   and worshipped God through that avenue.
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:14.140]   Only reason why we have this difficulty with finance is because we see it as ours.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.740]   It's mine.
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:20.260]   I've given it to God, the rest of it belongs to me, so we become stingy, and then we hoard
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:25.080]   that to ourselves, and then we don't honor God with it.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:30.680]   That's why the language that we see in scripture is to honor God with your finances.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.040]   Honor God with your finances.
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.000]   So we offer up to God.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.760]   We bless other people.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.920]   And we bless all the other people, and God is worshipped in that process.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.480]   The third and final free will offering is the peace offering mentioned in Leviticus
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.200]   chapter 3.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:54.340]   The cause of this offering is to, the offering was to be brought to God, recognizing that
[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:57.840]   because of God's sacrifice for us, that we have peace with one another.
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:02.780]   Romans 5, 1, "Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.080]   through our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:10.160]   Ephesians 2, 17 and 19, "And he came and preached peace to you who are far off, peace to those
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.720]   who are near, for through him we both have access in one spirit to the Father."
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.400]   So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.320]   and members of the household of God.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:25.220]   The very first thing that happened when sin came into the world, there was contention
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.220]   between husband and wife.
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:31.040]   The most intimate relationship in human relationship, husband and wife, and all of a sudden, they
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.260]   had to hide from each other.
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:37.840]   And as a result of that, the scripture says there is contention between husband and wife
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.480]   in Genesis chapter 3.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:47.760]   So the restoration of that vertical relationship with God, the first ramification of that is
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.880]   that our horizontal relationship with God is affected.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:56.920]   And so the third act of worship, they would come and they would offer sacrifices, only
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.280]   the parts that they can't eat, certain organs like the liver or the heart, and then anything
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:06.120]   that could be consumed, they would save that and they would have a picnic.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.520]   They would come on the side of the temple and then the priests and the offerer and their
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.680]   family would sit and actually enjoy that meal together.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:15.720]   And that's why it's called a peace offering.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.920]   That peace with God caused peace with one another.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:25.040]   And so the third act of offering for Christians, it has to do with vertical relationship with
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.080]   one another.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:37.440]   Ask any parent, ask any parent who has multiple children, how can we help you?
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:42.000]   Because being a parent is all-consuming.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.400]   When our kids were younger, we didn't have all this technology.
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:52.060]   Now you have this video thing that your kids are attached to the hip 24/7.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:55.240]   When our kids were younger, they could throw up in their crib and we wouldn't know till
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:56.680]   morning.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.040]   As long as they didn't cry their heads off and we wake up and they're sleeping in their
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.360]   vomit.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.080]   But we didn't have to deal with it three in the morning as long as they didn't wake up.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.880]   So we were at peace even though they were not.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:12.100]   Now you guys have this video thing 24/7.
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:13.220]   You have to watch your kids.
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:17.840]   So any parent is consumed all the time.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.120]   So if you want to help the parents, you have to help with the kids.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:25.360]   So if the kid comes up and says, "What can I do to help you?"
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.400]   Take care of your brothers.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.020]   Take care of your sister.
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.540]   That's how you're going to help me.
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:34.760]   Because when they are good, I am good.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.440]   Isn't that exactly what Jesus said?
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.240]   Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and spirit.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.720]   And the second is like it.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.120]   He doesn't say those are two separate things.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.600]   It's like it.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:48.200]   If you want to love God, love your brother, love your sister.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:52.600]   If you want to worship me, take care of your brother, take care of your sister.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.600]   Still all of my children are doing well.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.600]   None of our children are doing well.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.280]   That's why he puts us in a community.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:06.560]   He puts us in a community so we can practice the love of Christ.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:10.640]   The church is not a place where certain types of personalities, certain people who have
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:14.680]   kind of learned to get along, people who are not awkward, people who don't have ugliness
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:19.040]   inside, that we hope the sanctification took place before you became a Christian so at
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:24.720]   church we can practice how to be good to one another.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.080]   That's not the church.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:34.240]   Church is a place where people who absolutely needed the grace of God just to make it.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:42.240]   And so it's only reasonable to think that there's selfishness in the room, self-righteousness
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:49.920]   in the room, self-glorification, sometimes slander, maybe even hatred and bitterness.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.880]   That's all inside.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.760]   And our natural reaction is when we see that is to run the other direction because who
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.760]   wants to?
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.240]   Who wants to be around that?
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:04.440]   See, that's a human response.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.080]   That's a natural human response to sin when we see ugliness.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.920]   That's why we don't want to live in certain neighborhoods.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.720]   That's why we don't want to make certain kind of friends.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.680]   That's why we don't want to join certain kind of small groups.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.280]   Because as soon as we see some of this ugliness, we don't want part of that.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:24.880]   See, but when scripture says, when Jesus says, "They will know you by my love."
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:28.400]   The love that Jesus is talking about is unlike the love in the world.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:32.880]   If you love those people who are lovable, tell me somebody in the world that doesn't
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.560]   practice that.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.680]   They practice that in prison.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.680]   Criminals practice that.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.920]   Drug addicts practice that.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.840]   Drug dealers practice that.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.040]   That is not the love that Jesus is referring to.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.920]   He says, "Love as I have loved you, then the world will know that you are my disciples."
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.020]   And what is the love that he practiced with us?
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:59.560]   He saw our sin and instead of turning away, he came to us.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.240]   He ran toward us.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.400]   And he consumed our sins upon himself.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:09.720]   And then he says, "Come, die with me so that you can also live with me."
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:15.120]   So the church is a place where sinners are being sanctified.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:21.160]   Not sanctified sinners who are practicing everything that we know to be righteous, but
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:26.480]   sinners who are practicing to become sanctified.
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.480]   Practicing the love of Christ.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.400]   This is not something that you and I could do by our own strength.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:35.720]   Only those who have been affected by that love can practice that love.
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:41.580]   The communion that we take this morning is much like this peace offering.
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:44.480]   Because it is not meant to be done in isolation.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.640]   Everyone saw somebody would ask, "Do you mind if we have communion at our wedding?"
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.820]   And again, there's nothing saying that you can't have it at the wedding, but at our church
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.160]   we don't practice that.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:56.320]   The reason why we don't practice that is because it was not meant to be done in isolation.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.940]   It was not meant to be done with just two people.
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:02.560]   It was meant to be very public within the body of Christ, where the whole church gets
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:09.040]   together to recognize that we are a part of the larger group.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.880]   That we together are having this time together.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:17.160]   That peace with God has created peace with one another.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:22.800]   And that's why Paul says in 1 Corinthians 11, 17, 18, their division in the Corinthian
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.520]   church was defiling the communion table.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.880]   Because they didn't recognize what the communion table was.
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:32.280]   1 Corinthians 11, 17 says, "But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.520]   when you come together it is not for the better, but for the worse.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:39.080]   For in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.400]   among you."
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.080]   And then he leads into the communion and says, verse 20, "When you come together, it is not
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.000]   the Lord's supper that you eat.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.320]   For in eating, each one goes ahead in his own meal.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.480]   One goes hungry, another gets drunk.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.560]   What do you not have in the houses to eat and drink?
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:58.080]   Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing?
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.080]   What shall I say to you?
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.080]   Shall I commend you in this?
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.080]   No, I will not."
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:05.160]   In other words, they're participating in this communion table and they're not thinking about
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:08.120]   anybody else but themselves.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:13.280]   And as a result, they are defiling the communion table, because they don't recognize what it
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.380]   was for.
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:20.600]   We can easily come to a church and pick and choose, especially a church our size.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:24.120]   Those people I relate to, those people I do not.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.080]   Those people I like, I like to smuggle with this group, but I don't like to smuggle with
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.080]   that group.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.840]   I want to be in this group, but not that group.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:35.720]   And at the core of our heart, we do not recognize what Christ has done.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:41.360]   What we are recognized for is the love that Christ practiced on us.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.120]   And so therefore, we practice with one another.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:50.320]   That when we see ugliness, it's not if, it's when we see ugliness in other people that
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.160]   we practice grace.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:56.120]   That's when we have an opportunity to worship God.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:00.520]   Because God is honored and glorified, the more difficult it is to love that person,
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:03.360]   because it reflects Christ's love.
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:08.420]   Not just any love, but Christ's love is reflected when it is difficult to love.
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:13.620]   So if we are a church filled with people, attracting people who are attractive inside
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:17.720]   and out, that is not the church of Christ.
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:24.080]   The church of Christ must run to those people who are in need of grace.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:28.320]   2 Corinthians 11 27 29, "Whoever therefore eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:32.960]   in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and the blood of the Lord.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:37.000]   Let a person examine himself, then so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.200]   For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself."
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:48.360]   So when he says discerning the body, he's talking about the others.
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:52.200]   How many of us sit in isolation?
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:56.180]   I love Jesus, but I don't love these people.
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:42:01.780]   I love God, but I want nothing to do with these ugly people.
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.920]   And what did Jesus say?
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:09.640]   You can't say you love God and hate your brother, then neither do you love God.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:16.760]   See, the third offering, the peace offering, is a reminder to us that our act of worship,
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:21.440]   our most tangible way to express our act of worship is through finance and with other
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.800]   people.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:28.680]   So this morning as we participate in the communion table, as we open it up, I want to encourage
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.100]   you to take some time to reflect on yourself.
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:35.820]   Don't think about other people, don't think about anything else but yourself as an act
[00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:36.820]   of worship.
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:42.400]   How can I worship God and that our communion table will remind us, not because you're righteous,
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:48.440]   not because of what you've done, but because of what he has done in light of his mercy,
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:54.200]   in view of his mercy, to offer our bodies as a living sacrifice, which is our reasonable
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.140]   act of worship.
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:00.700]   So this morning we're going to open up the communion table, and again we want to remind
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.540]   you in order to avoid traffic in the middle, we're going to ask you guys to come to the
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:07.280]   side and then take the elements and then go down the middle.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.760]   Again unless you're sitting right here, you don't need to go all the way around, but just
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:10.760]   get it here.
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.240]   We just don't want to create traffic here.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:17.320]   And again I want to remind you that this is for the baptized believers in the church.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:20.840]   Again the first act of obedience should be baptism and not communion.
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:24.760]   So if you're a believer and you have not been baptized, we ask that you come and be baptized
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:25.760]   first.
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:31.360]   And then secondly, if you're not a believer, if you have not confessed the Lord as your
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:36.120]   Savior, this is sort of an anniversary to kind of remember what Christ has done.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:40.080]   So if you're not a believer, we ask that you just kind of stay at your seat.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:45.340]   There is no power in and of itself unless it symbolizes cleansing of blood in your life.
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:49.820]   So if that is not where you are, we ask that you would remain in your seat and just think
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:52.120]   carefully about the things that we've discussed.
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:56.280]   Again but for the rest of us, I ask that you guys would stay in your seats and take some
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:02.960]   time to pray, repent of unrepentant sins, unreconciled relationships, and to really
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:07.280]   commit to God to be a true worshiper.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.160]   Have I surrendered my life to Christ?
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:12.480]   Do my finances reflect His Lordship and His grace?
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.800]   Am I worshiping God in finances?
[00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:20.640]   Third, is His grace reflective on the way that I treat other people and who I treat
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.880]   in that way?
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.880]   And take some time to reflect on that to discern the body of Christ before you come up.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:31.320]   So I want to read the passage again in 1 Corinthians chapter 11, and I'm going to pray and open
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.120]   up the communion table so when you're all ready, we ask that one by one you would come
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.120]   up.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:41.440]   1 Corinthians 11, verse 23, "For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you,
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:45.760]   that the Lord Jesus on the night when He was betrayed took bread, and when He had given
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.820]   thanks He broke it and said, 'This is my body which is for you.
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:51.000]   Do this in remembrance of me.'
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.400]   In the same way also He took the cup after supper and saying, 'This cup is a new covenant
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.400]   in my blood.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:00.760]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.'"
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:06.000]   Heavenly Father, we come before you this morning asking, Lord God, that you would help
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:12.920]   us to continue to see the varying degrees of your glory, that we may reflect that glory
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:15.520]   from one degree to another.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:21.400]   We ask, Lord God, that you would affect us deeply, that what you have already done, what
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:26.400]   you have already given, Lord God, would consume us, that everything that we give to you would
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.760]   be an act of worship.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:32.320]   I pray, Father God, that you would examine our hearts, see if there's any hurtful ways
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:38.840]   in us, that this sacred time, Lord, would have its effect that you've desired.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.800]   We open it up, Lord God, asking for your grace.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   In Jesus' name we pray.
