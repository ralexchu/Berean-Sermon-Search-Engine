[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.960]   So many of our emails are asking about
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.400]   how to overcome the fears of life
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.320]   and how to overcome personal insecurities as well.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.800]   We all wanna live with a fearless confidence in God.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.040]   And for many of us, that fearless confidence is hard to find.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.560]   On this theme, I found the following sermon clip
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.280]   from Pastor John back in 1983,
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.600]   looking at the ministry of the Apostle Peter
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.560]   and his fears and his insecurities
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.880]   as they are recorded in scripture.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.920]   The Apostle Peter was Jewish, of course,
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.340]   and Christ changed his life.
[00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.640]   Peter experienced a radical transformation
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.000]   in his thinking about God's plan.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.640]   He came to discover that the Messiah
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.700]   had not just come for Israel,
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.400]   but for all the peoples, all the nations.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.040]   That's basically the point of his vision
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.680]   in which a tablecloth full of unclean animals
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.120]   descends from the heavens in Acts chapter 10.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.640]   The gospel was for the Gentiles too.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.000]   That was the point of the vision.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.320]   So Peter should have known better
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.160]   than to fall into a fearful insecurity
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.320]   when he met others who contradicted this point.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.040]   Galatians 2.12 explains what happened in his life
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.520]   where we read this, that quote,
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.120]   "For before certain men came from James,
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.120]   he, Peter, was eating with the Gentiles, the non-Jews.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.000]   But when they came, he drew back and separated himself,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.800]   fearing the circumcision party, the Jews."
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.480]   That's Galatians 2.12.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.920]   It's this context that sets the stage
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.240]   for an important life lesson
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.440]   about overcoming fear and insecurities.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.400]   Here's Pastor John.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.400]   In other words, God has shown me
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.480]   that redemptive history teaches
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.560]   that there are no preconditions
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.560]   for the receiving of the Holy Spirit,
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.760]   but one, hearing the gospel with faith.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.000]   Isn't that what Paul said in Galatians 3.2,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.520]   when he said, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.160]   by works of the law or by hearing with faith?"
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.880]   That's the gospel.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.080]   That's the good news.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.840]   And that means that when Peter in Antioch
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.560]   was eating with Gentiles in all freedom,
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.520]   he was walking in sync with the gospel.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.960]   And Paul was happy.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.280]   "Way to go, Peter.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.840]   You've come a long way, brother."
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.880]   Then something happened.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.120]   Even though he was honoring the all-sufficiency of Christ,
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.440]   walking in love, trusting the Lord, free,
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.200]   here come the men from James.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.480]   Now, we can only speculate as to
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.160]   what was their relationship to James.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.040]   Was James endorsing what they were gonna say?
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.880]   Or we don't even know what they were going to say for sure.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.320]   We don't know why they came.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.960]   But one thing is made very explicit.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.520]   Peter was afraid of them.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.240]   Why?
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.360]   Maybe they were capable of violence.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.080]   I mean, he had really offended
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.120]   the conservative party in Jerusalem.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.880]   Maybe it was simply that he would be called upon
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.680]   to give a theological justification
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.240]   of how he could neglect Leviticus 11, it's the word of God.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.040]   And he would come off poorly
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.160]   before the Christians in Antioch, and he doesn't want to.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.080]   Or maybe, and this seems to me maybe more likely,
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.040]   if he gets in bad with the conservatives in Jerusalem,
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.120]   he's gonna lose his status and his respect
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.880]   as the leader in that church, which he still possessed.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.360]   And in fact, that happened,
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.320]   because James, by the end of the book of Acts,
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.200]   is the leader of the church in Jerusalem.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.760]   We're not told, but he was afraid,
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.320]   and in a moment of weakness,
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.320]   he cut himself off from those Gentile believers.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.480]   This is a great lesson in leadership here.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.400]   You see what happens when a leader goes wrong?
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.480]   Everybody went wrong.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.040]   The whole Jewish contingent in the church
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.480]   fell into line with Peter,
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.080]   and Barnabas, son of encouragement,
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.040]   lover of Paul, on his first missionary journey
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.960]   among the Gentiles.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.960]   The pressure was so strong, he went with them,
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.160]   left all the Gentiles alone.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.640]   Now, put yourself in the position
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.600]   of a Gentile believer in Antioch.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.440]   What would that have meant to you?
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.560]   According to verse 14, Paul says that Peter and Barnabas
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.560]   and the others are, to use the words of the RSV,
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.560]   not walking straightforward about the truth of the gospel.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.080]   Better way of saying it may be,
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.720]   they're not walking right with the truth of the gospel.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.200]   They are out of sync with the gospel.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.680]   Now, do you see what that means?
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.040]   That means that it is true,
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.720]   the benefits of the gospel come on one condition alone,
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.280]   hearing it with faith.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.320]   But when the gospel comes, it changes your life
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.560]   so that there is a life in sync with the gospel,
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.880]   and there is a life out of sync with the gospel.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.920]   That's why Paul, even though he was standing up
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.880]   for the complete freedom in grace of the gospel,
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.360]   could say, "You're out of line.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.080]   "You're out of sync with the gospel.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.160]   "You don't attain the benefits of the gospel
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.720]   "by doing a little moral cleanup job
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.840]   "on your life, you obtain it,
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.360]   "forgiveness, cleansing, joy, peace, power.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.680]   "You obtain all that by faith in the gospel.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.520]   "But when the gospel so grips you,
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.240]   "when you begin to hear and believe
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.520]   "the drumbeat of the gospel,
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.760]   "the rhythm of your steps changes."
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.280]   And so Paul took Peter to task,
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.200]   and we need to see three things
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.000]   that were out of sync with the gospel here in closing.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.320]   I was teaching a Bible study on this text
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.720]   to a group of men yesterday, and I asked them,
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.440]   "What are the three things out of sync
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.600]   "with the gospel here?"
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.560]   And they nailed every one of them right on the head.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.720]   Number one, fear.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.520]   Number two, hypocrisy.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.840]   And number three, legalism.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.000]   And let's look at those together,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.760]   because we don't want to be out of sync
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.240]   with the gospel when we leave this church, do we?
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.640]   Fear is out of step with the gospel.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.800]   The gospel does not beget fear.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.000]   Paul said in 1 Timothy 1:7,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.760]   "God did not give us a spirit of fear,
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.760]   "but of power, love, self-control."
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.800]   If you come this morning, and I'm sure
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.720]   in a crowd like this, there are many,
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.640]   you come this morning afraid,
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.200]   maybe of something very specific that's on the way,
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.240]   or maybe, like sometimes happens to me,
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.320]   just a cloud of anxiety.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.120]   You can't put your finger on what in the world it is.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.200]   You just feel tense and anxious,
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.680]   and something's gonna go bad today.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.400]   And if you come like that this morning,
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.760]   you know what you need more than anything in the world?
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.760]   You need to see the gospel.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.480]   You need to see that the gospel says something
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.640]   about God's intentions towards you this week.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.240]   When you look at the death of Jesus on the cross
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.440]   for your sins, you know what that says
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.960]   about God's intentions for you?
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.160]   It says, "I am for you and not against you
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.560]   "with all my might this week."
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.040]   Paul put it like this, "What then shall we say to this?
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.480]   "If God is for us, who can be against us?
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.160]   "If he did not spare his only Son,
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.640]   "but gave him up for us all,
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.720]   "will he not with him give us all things?
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.720]   "Who shall bring any charge against God's elect?
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.160]   "It is God who justifies.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.720]   "Who is to condemn?
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.920]   "It was Christ Jesus who died,
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.280]   "yes, was raised, is at the right hand of God,
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.400]   "and intercedes for us."
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.360]   If you see the gospel and believe the gospel,
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.800]   you know what your heart cries out?
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.480]   "The Lord is my helper.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.680]   "I will not fear.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.600]   "What can man do to me?"
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.840]   So I hope that if you are burned with fear this morning,
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.160]   you just, the Lord will grant the eyes of your hearts
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.200]   to be open to see the gospel.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.520]   Second, hypocrisy is out of step with the gospel.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.520]   Verse 13 says, "The rest of the Jews acted insincerely."
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.480]   Literally, the word is hypocritically.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.480]   "So that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy."
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:43.080]   Peter and Barnabas and the Jews were being two-faced.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.040]   They were saying, on the one hand,
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:51.800]   "In my heart, I really believe that I am free
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.680]   "to live like the Gentiles
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.640]   "and not keep the ceremonial dietary laws anymore.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.520]   "But with my behavior, I will say,
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.440]   "to avoid the censure of the Judaizers,
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.280]   "oh, I'm really living like a Jew up here in Antioch.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.120]   "I'm keeping the law."
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.400]   Why were they doing that?
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.680]   Because they were so incredibly fearful
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.720]   of the persecution or criticism or censure
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:24.200]   or something they were gonna get from these people.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.440]   Isn't it true?
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.040]   Test your own experience and what you've seen in others.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:33.040]   Isn't it true that all hypocrisy is rooted in fear
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.160]   or insecurity?
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.000]   And that's out of step with the gospel.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.480]   Insecurity is inconsistent with the gospel.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.240]   And I could just, I don't know how many in this room
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.800]   would be insecure this morning,
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.800]   just really insecure.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.960]   No root and stability and firmness and strength
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.320]   in your life so that you have confidence and boldness
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.600]   as you walk through your days in God.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.040]   And you know the battle that you are fighting
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.040]   when some people or circumstances approach you,
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.040]   they demand, if you have integrity,
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.200]   that you stand up for your principles,
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.680]   but instead of standing up for your principles,
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.440]   you put up a front, you commit hypocrisy
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.440]   to avoid their censure.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.240]   You know what battle you're fighting at that moment?
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.120]   A battle to believe the gospel.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.320]   Some of us sort of divide our lives up and we say,
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.480]   "Well, the gospel was what I had dealings with
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.760]   "when I was a little child and walked the aisle
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.360]   "or when I was humbled by the Lord and converted.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.920]   "And now my battles are something else."
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.120]   That's not true.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.240]   It's all in the gospel.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:56.240]   And every day, the walk of faith is a battle
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:01.120]   to believe the gospel, that God is for you
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.440]   and not against you, as was declared in Jesus Christ
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.160]   when he died on the cross.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.360]   And there's a second way, besides that great statement
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.400]   of God being for us, that the gospel helps me
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.680]   avoid hypocrisy.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.120]   I picture Jesus in the gospel,
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:27.400]   facing the cross, a worse threat than I've ever faced
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:32.680]   or ever will face, having the option to play the hypocrite.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.800]   He could have denied before Caiaphas
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.480]   that he was the son of God and saved his skin,
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.200]   like Peter and the Jews denied their principles
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:49.200]   and saved their noses, and he didn't for me and you.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.160]   He laid himself down on that cross
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.160]   without playing the hypocrite that I might have life.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.760]   And here comes a temptation for me to play the hypocrite
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.520]   and avoid some little criticism or persecution.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.520]   And shall I not be shamed by the cross, the gospel,
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.760]   if I play that game?
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.360]   Center your life on Jesus Christ and his gospel
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.680]   and the root of hypocrisy will be severed.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.040]   - Yeah, the gospel severing power to kill the fear
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.240]   and insecurities of our lives.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.200]   There's some potent truth here in this clip
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.840]   taken from John Piper's sermon,
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.120]   titled In Sync With the Gospel,
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.880]   preached on February 27th, 1983.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.080]   It can be found online at desiringgod.org.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.040]   If you have a sermon clip for me,
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.560]   email me your name, hometown, the sermon title,
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.680]   and the timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.960]   Tell me what stands out to you
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.800]   and put the word clip in the subject line of an email
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.560]   and send it to me at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.240]   That's our email address, askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:02.000]   Well, it's interesting that the only time Galatians 2:12
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.600]   has ever been mentioned on this podcast until today
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.920]   was in an episode on Christian rap of all topics.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.320]   Episode is titled, "Must Christian Rap Have the Gospel
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.000]   in Every Song?"
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.240]   That was APJ 188 on what it means for Christian music
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.000]   to be in step with the gospel.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.800]   Really good episode, episode APJ 188.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.040]   And speaking of being out of step with the gospel,
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.740]   fear is a big deal.
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.440]   We saw that today when we saw that God gave us a spirit
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:37.440]   not of fear, but of power and love and self-control.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.240]   That again is 2 Timothy 1:7.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.040]   We should know that text really well,
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.780]   but knowing that text really well
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.700]   doesn't make the fear go away.
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.920]   That's the dilemma a fearing Christian named Eric
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.200]   is now facing in his life.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.680]   We address his ongoing struggle with fear next time.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.520]   I'm your host Tony Renke,
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.120]   and we're rejoined in studio with Pastor John on Friday.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.020]   We'll see you then.
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:14.180]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
