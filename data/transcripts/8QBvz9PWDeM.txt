[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   >> Okay, so hope you guys had a good time.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   In fellowship, hanging out, going out to eat together.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   As we think about this day's theme of God's holiness and things like that.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   A big portion of it, obviously,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   it's not necessarily something brand spanking new to you.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   But every time we get together like this, it is such good refreshes for
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   us to think about how we are treating God and how we're relating to him.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And so let's take a moment to pray.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And then as we enter into time of worship,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   I want us to kind of frame it in that way.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Worship can be an activity for us.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   But also in many ways, we know there is a directional and
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   relational aspect where this is our expression, right?
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   This is in many ways, this is how we're treating the Lord, so to speak.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Let's take a moment to bow in prayer.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Heavenly Father, as I think about, as we together think about you,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   we want to, Lord, more and more express to you how much we love you.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   And being able to sing to you, Lord God, is sweet food to our soul.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Because God, that is a longing of our heart.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   And Lord, as we hear your word, for a lot of us,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   these things that we hear is just a reminder to God that we want to
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   respect you for who you are, we want to prioritize you for who you are,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   and we want to love you for who you are.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   And so to that end, God, I pray that all the things that we hear,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   the words that we lift up to you, would truly be for us
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   expressions of our relationship with you.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And God, would you continue to bless us in that?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Lord, as we sing to you, would you bless our heart?
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   And then Lord, as we hear your word, would you thoroughly cause our
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   minds and our hearts to be blessed this time?
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   We thank you it's in Christ and we pray. Amen.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Why don't we all stand for a time of praise?
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   [Music]
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Lift up your case, be lifted up. Tell everyone how great the love.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   We've come down from heaven's gates to kiss the earth with hope and grace.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Lift up your case, be lifted up. Tell everyone how great the love.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   We've come down from heaven's gates to kiss the earth with hope and grace.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Who is this King of glory? The Lord is strong and mighty.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Lift up your hands, be lifted up. Let the redeemed declare the love.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   And we bow down at heaven's gates to kiss the feet of hope and grace.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Who is this King of glory? The Lord is strong and mighty.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   There is one God, he is holy. There is one Lord over everything.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   There is one King, he is Jesus. The King of glory, strong and mighty.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   There is one God, he is holy. There is one Lord over everything.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   There is one King, he is Jesus. The King of glory, strong and mighty.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   You are the King of glory. The Lord is strong and mighty.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   You are the King of glory. The Lord is strong and mighty.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   You are the King of glory. The Lord is strong and mighty.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   You are the King of glory. The Lord is strong and mighty.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my soul.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   I live for you alone. Every breath that I take.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Every moment I'm awake. Lord, have your way in me.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   This is my desire. This is my desire.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   To honor you. Lord, with all my heart, I worship you.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   All I have within me, I give you first.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   All that I adore is in you.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my soul.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   I live for you alone. Every breath that I take.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Every moment I'm awake. Lord, have your way in me.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   This is my desire. This is my desire.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   To honor you. Lord, with all my heart, I worship you.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   All I have within me, I give you first.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   All that I adore is in you.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my soul.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   I live for you alone. Every breath that I take.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Every moment I'm awake. Lord, have your way in me.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my soul.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   I live for you alone. Every breath that I take.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Every moment I'm awake. Lord, have your way in me.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   [Music]
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   You may be seated.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   [Music]
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Okay.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   So, earlier I mentioned, you know, this is in many ways, as we think about the holiness of God,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   and then our own application of that, it is kind of like a motivational speech,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   in the sense that essentially what we're singing there is at the heart of the exhortation.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Basically, to love God more.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   If we're seeing him in the right light, to respect him more, to honor him more,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   to prioritize him more, right? That's at the heart of the exhortation.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   And earlier this morning, we were learning and thinking through,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   if we think about the holiness of God, and particularly the fact that he is unique,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   and therefore of utmost, highest, and transcendent value,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   then there is a different way you handle him.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   There's a different way you treat him.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Where it should not be just like every single day, and it should be essentially uncommon,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   as opposed to commonplace.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   And what I said was, what's really profound about all this,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   is then in terms of not only God's holiness, but our relationship to it,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   what is going to be the primary character trait of that relationship we have with God.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   And the exhortation I have for you in this second sermon,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   is that this relationship is going to be marked by faithfulness.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   And another way to put it, is how I entitled this day, and the topic and theme,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   is faithfulness can be synonymous with something like loyalty.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   You're doing your best to be loyal to this God.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   But another way I want to put it, is in order to be loyal with God,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   there is this element of exclusivity.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Where there is this element of, yes, you're being loyal to God,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   but not at the same time, entertaining or having other relationships.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   And so that's why I entitled the day's theme, "Reserved for God."
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   That our interaction and relationship with God is not about just the do's and don'ts,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   it's not about limitations, it's not about prohibitions,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   but it's more about your reservation, that you have been set apart,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   consecrated for the Lord.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   And therefore, when other opportunities come, when other enjoyments,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   other enticements and allurements come, that our heart says, "Nope,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   I'm not actually engaging in this because I have already been claimed,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   and reserved for the Lord."
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   That is the way we ought to think, that is the way we're supposed to be framing
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   our interaction with God.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   In the epic battle between, "Oh, are we supposed to operate by faith?"
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   and then trying to fight our natural inclination to do what is easy,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   which is to operate by law, operate by rules and principles.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Just tell me what I need to do.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   In that epic battle, the way you overcome is to make sure that your relationship
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   with God is seen by way of these words, "Your reserved faithfulness,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   your simplistic but very clear devotion, I'm yours."
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   That's it.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   And that's why I said today is going to be in many ways just a reminder,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   a push, and a motivation for you to love the Lord in that way,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   to be able to say, "God, there's a sentiment that I want to express to you,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   which was in the morning, 'You matter so much to me, you're everything.'"
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   But then there's also another flip side to that exact same coin,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   which is you being able to say, "I'm entirely yours."
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   And there, I'm done with my sermon.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   That's the main point, that's the main thrust, and that's how I want to phrase it.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   One of the passages that we read earlier in our mini-talk or mini-sermon
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   at 2 o'clock was Galatians 5, verse 22.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   And I'm going to just reference for you, so don't turn there for the sake of time.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Just listen carefully.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Galatians 5, verse 22 stated, "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control."
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   And then it says, "Against such things there is no law."
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   Pause there and ask the question, "Huh, but there is law, right?"
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   God commands us to be patient with all.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   God commands us to have joy. "Rejoice always," He said, right?
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   God commands us to be kind and good and just and faithful.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   God commands us to be gentle even with those who are caught in sin.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   The very next chapter, Galatians 6, actually begins with that.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   "If a brother is caught in sin, you who are spiritual, correct him, but with gentleness."
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   That's an order.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   So what in the world does He mean when He says that the fruits of the Spirit,
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   of such things there is no law?
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Why? Why no law when you've clearly given us commandment in the Scripture?
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Because in life, there are things that are not governed by just simply law.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Especially when you have the heart of saying, "I am 100% yours."
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Tell me, what governing principles, what governing limitations, right?
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   What governing to-dos and not-dos exists in a kind of hard attitude that says,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   "I am 100% yours." Why? Because I love you.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Right?
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   There are things in life that are not governed in such ways,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   but are rather governed by love, reservation,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   where you have reserved yourself freely and volitionally to the Lord.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   And what you have then is not law, but you have freedom.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   You can come and ask me for advice.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Do you think it's wise to give X amount to the Lord?
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Do you think it's wise to devote two hours to praise?
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   Do you think it's wise?
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   What do you think I'm going to say to you?
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Do it!
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   It would be awesome if you could pray for an hour,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   sing songs like this for two hours, read the Scriptures for three,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   fellowship with the saints for four.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Just do it to your heart's content.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Why? Because that question of "should I" is not governed by law.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   It's governed by your love relationship with God. Amen?
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And that's the amazing thing we have with the Lord,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   where God has given to us this context.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   This is, again, one of the massive grace gifts of the Gospel,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   for you to freely love God and have Him,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   but also for you to freely give of yourself to the Lord
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   that you would be fully His.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Take a look at this passage. This is point one.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Turn your Bibles to Leviticus 20, verses 24-26.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Leviticus 20, verses 24-26.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   As we turn there, this is where we recognize
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   what's funny is Leviticus is an entire book of laws.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   And yet what we find is this operating principle
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   that God's love is upon us, and He gives to us the context
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   that we would freely, freely engage the Lord in this love relationship.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Leviticus 20, starting from verse 24, says this.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   "Hence I have said to you, you are to possess their land,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   and I myself will give it to you to possess it,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   a land flowing with milk and honey."
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   That's a promise of God. I'm going to give this to you.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   But then He says, "I am the Lord your God,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   who has separated you from the peoples."
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   That's the love of God. God has consecrated you.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   He has now made you no longer just like the rest,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   following the devices of fallen mankind,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   but He has sanctified you.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   He has pulled you out from a wicked generation.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   And then He said, "I'm going to make you mine."
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Verse 25, "You are therefore to make a distinction
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   between the clean animal and the unclean,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   and between the unclean bird and the clean.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   And you shall not make yourselves detestable by animal or by bird
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   or by anything that creeps on the ground,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   which I have separated for you as unclean.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Thus, you are to be holy to me,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   for I the Lord am holy,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   and I have set you apart from the peoples to be mine."
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Wow.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   We could camp out here and meditate on this.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Point one, essentially, is to recognize and meditate
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   that our relationship with the Holy God
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   is to think of it as reserved for Him.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Right?
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Our relationship with the Holy God is to be reserved for Him.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   That's point one.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Take a moment to meditate and think about this.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   In so many different sermons and in so many different contexts,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   we have been thoroughly rebuked.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   "Do not see God as the vending machine
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   who is there to give you gifts for this life."
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Absolutely true. Right?
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   And in the Gospel, we recognize to think of God in such ways
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   is to belittle Him and to belittle the work that He has done.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Why?
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Because to think of the Gospel in that way,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   where God is a giver of gifts,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   it means that God, upon looking at the orphan child
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   who is naked, bleeding, and cast out, and thrown away--
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   that's how the Scripture describes,
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   God describes people prior to His salvation work.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   He saw a child, bloody, naked, thrown away.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   And if you believe the Gospel of this sort, you're saying,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   "God gave that baby a nice camping mat.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   What a gracious God."
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   That's not the reality of the Gospel.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   God did not come by and say, "Do you need a canteen?
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   You thirsty?"
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   To see God as merely a giver of gifts
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   is to see God as an individual
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   who happened to be a good Samaritan.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   But that's not the fullness of the Gospel.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   The fullness of the Gospel was,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   "You who are bloodied and cast out,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   I bring you home.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   I adopt you and make you mine.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   I am now going to be responsible,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   not only, yes, for your food,
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   not only for your sleep,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   but for your sustenance, provision, and entirety of life."
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And ask the child, "What would you like more?
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   Would you like a nice camping mat,
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   or would you like a father?"
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   That to us is a distinction,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   and that's what we have for us in Leviticus,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   is our relationship with this Holy God
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   is that He has sanctified us
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   and consecrated us to Him.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   So the point of the text,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   the verse you're underlining is verse 24 and 26,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   where it says, "Thus you are to be holy to me."
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   He says, "You're supposed to be holy to me."
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   And He Himself says, "I set you apart
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   from the rest of the people."
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   How emphatic there is, "to be mine."
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   You see, in the epic battle of living life as a Pharisee
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   and a legalist versus living life by faith
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   is understanding this distinction.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   My holiness is not a token of my achievement.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   My holiness is this relationship.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   God has set me apart for Him.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Right?
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Those individuals who see holiness
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   as some kind of benchmark,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   those individuals who see holiness
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   as some kind of leveling up,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   like it's some kind of single-player strategy game,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   it's an absolute different worldview.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   But here and now, God is teaching us
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   there is a relational, applied nature
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   to the relationship we have with this Holy God.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   And therefore, we see the connection
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   in Deuteronomy chapter 6.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Go there now, Deuteronomy chapter 6, verses 4,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   and as a prep for you,
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   this passage is to the Jew the epic passage.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   This is the passage every good Jew has to memorize.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   This is the passage every good Jew has to recite
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   over and over again.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   But what we know it as is this is the golden rule,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   the greatest of all commandments.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Let me read it for you guys.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Deuteronomy chapter 6, verse 4.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   It says, "Hear, O Israel,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   "the Lord is one."
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   That statement summarizes for us
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   what we learned in the morning.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   He is unique, he is singular,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   there is none like him,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   and therefore he is of utmost sacredness,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   utmost value.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   And therefore, verse 5,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   "You shall then love the Lord your God
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   "with all your heart, with all your soul,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   "with all your might,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   "and these words that I command you today
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   "shall be on your heart.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   "You shall teach them diligently to your children
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   "and shall talk to them when you sit in your house
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   "and when you walk by the way
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   "and you will lie down and when you rise."
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   All of these things he says,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   "You shall bind them as a sign on your hand.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   "They shall be as frontlets between your eyes."
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   They had little boxes, some of these individuals.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   "You shall write them on the doorposts of your house
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   "and on your gates."
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   What's really interesting about all this
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   is just a moment ago I said,
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   "According to the governance of love,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   "there is no such law in terms of what you should do."
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   But here, he describes what you should do
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   to express the love that you have for God.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Basically, write it everywhere.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   The fact of the matter is, though,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   for every single one of us, we know what it means
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   to love so much that we would gladly post photos
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   of the people we love everywhere.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Right?
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   You all have photos of your family members,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   your best friends, right on your desk.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   It's the same concept,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   that the standalone God should have such high place
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   in our affection.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Yes?
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   The God who is one should have such a high place
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   in all of our affection that with our heart, soul,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   and mind, we adore him.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   This is the kind of relationship we are to have.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Now, the reason why I'm trying to emphasize it
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   and rephrase it and repicture it
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   is because this is where truly the battle is.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   If this affection wanes,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   then everything you do at church in terms of putting up photos,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   putting up this, you know what that's going to feel like?
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   It's going to feel like having a box between your eyes.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   You know what it's going to feel like?
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   It's going to feel like having a sticker on your hand
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   and saying you did something.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   If this aspect of the affection that you have for God
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   because he is singular, because he is holy, is lost,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   then the reason and purpose for everything we do at church is lost.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   And so I want to rephrase how we are to think of our relationship with God
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   in another way by having you turn to 2 Corinthians 11, verse 2.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Turn your Bibles to 2 Corinthians 11, verse 2.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   [PAUSE]
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   Okay.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   [PAUSE]
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   As you turn there, Apostle Paul is going to frame for us
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   how he envisions our relationship with the Lord.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   And Apostle Paul in that statement then also is able to place himself
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   and his role in the universe.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Take a look at this.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   2 Corinthians 11, verse 2.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   It says, "For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   for I betrothed you to one husband,
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   so that to Christ I might present you as a pure virgin.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   your minds will be led astray from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ."
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Take a moment to think and meditate on that,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   how he is envisioning your relationship to Christ.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   And then therefore he's able to think about his role.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   How many of you guys like being matchmakers?
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   How many of you guys enjoy that stuff?
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   It's like, you know who you'd fit really well with?
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   And when you see people, you're like, you know who you could get really along with?
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Apostle Paul is picturing himself as the matchmaker.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   He's like, you know what I want to do?
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   Not only am I going to be your matchmaker, I'm going to prepare you.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   I'm going to help you get all dressed up.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   I'm going to prepare you, get all ready for your union with Christ.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   That's the way he's envisioning.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   So the reason why this all matters is because
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   when we start thinking about the practicals of your daily decisions in your holiness,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   and we talked about it during the Q&A, decisions about your moves,
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   like where and when you move, decisions about your career,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   decisions also, yes, about dating, decisions about how much and why you invest,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   all of these things has an element of what should you do
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   based on wisdom and reality and information you have.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   However, here and now then, we're going to use a different kind of parameter,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   a kind of wisdom that is not exercised by the world.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   You see, the world has its kind of standards,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   and it keeps wanting to tell this to us.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   Just maximize your gain. Easy.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   I can tell you what to do. Just maximize.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   You know, a famous philosopher, Aristotle, he had lots of principles for living.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   One of the things he said that people use is, "You know what? In everything, just moderation.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Just don't overdo it." And some people live by that mantra.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   Just want a balanced life. Everything has to be kind of manageable.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   My schedule, my ambitions, my church, my devotion, all that kind of stuff.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   But honestly speaking, all those things is low standards of living.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   All of those things are deficient principles. Why?
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   Because for us, what we're trying to do is preserve ourselves in the purity that God wants
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   so that we would be as pure virgins for Christ.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   To think of ourselves in that way, "I am reserved."
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   And so, when you think about that, think about all the ramifications.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   I didn't want to just give you specific do's and don'ts.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   I wanted to give you a broader framework.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   Think about the ramifications of what it means for you to not give yourself away to various things,
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   but rather preserve yourself so that you would be pure.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   And so, I want to talk about a couple of these things.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   Now, the way that I'm going to move into talking about these things is to say,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   when we think about being pure, being reserved, and preserved,
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   I want us to follow the example of Christ.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   Because another way to think of it is the fastest way to holiness is to be more like Jesus.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   And so, in this whole talk about having a relationship,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   in this whole talk about being in an intimate relationship with God, with love,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   have you ever thought about this?
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   It's like, "Huh, sometimes I struggle so much with how do I express myself?
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   How do I express my love for the Lord?"
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   Have you ever thought about copying Jesus and his love for God?
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   Jesus is typically to us the model of suffering, the model of sacrifice.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   Jesus is typically to us the model of how to absorb all the angst, anxiety, and troubles of this world.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   That's typically a lot of times how people think of Jesus' example.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Have you ever thought about Jesus' example in his love and devotion to God the Father?
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   And that's what we're going to do.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   Scripture tells us that our fastest way to holiness essentially is imitation.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   That we who call on the name of the Lord, as we abide in him, we ought to walk in the way that he walked.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   Right?
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   So, in this way of thinking about it, the next point I want to talk about, point two,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   is in the example of Christ, his reservation for God was his loyalty.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   I want you to write down an important term to think about his loyalty.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   Turn in your Bibles to John chapter 17, verse 13.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   Okay?
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   This is Jesus' high priestly prayer.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   What an intimate relationship that Jesus had with God.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   Such a way that he really expressed himself as one with the Lord.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   But what you find is Jesus saying to God, essentially, on this life,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   "I've walked the path that you have set. I've walked in loyalty to you."
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   So, if you turn in your Bibles to John chapter 17, this is Jesus going to the cross, praying to the Father,
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   and this is what he says.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   Starting from verse 13.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   He says, "Actually, although it's a little bit long, I'm going to start from Jesus' prayer there in verse 1.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   It says, "Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that the Son may glorify you.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   Even as you gave him authority over all flesh, that to all whom you have given him, he may give eternal life.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   This is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   I glorified you on the earth, having accomplished the work which you have given me to do.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   Now, Father, glorify me together with yourself, with the glory which I had with you before the world was.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   I have manifested your name to the men you gave me out of the world.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   Now they have come to know that everything you have given me is from you.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   For the words which you have given me, I have given to them."
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   Do you see this repeated theme?
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   Everything you gave me, I kept.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   I've honored you. I've served you. I've magnified you.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   Every word you give me, I've spoken.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   That's the theme that he's going to constantly say.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   Where was I? Verse 9.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   "I ask on their behalf, I do not ask on behalf of the world, but of those whom you have given me, for they are yours.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   And all things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I have been glorified in them.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   I am no longer in the world, and yet they themselves are in the world, and I have come to you, Holy Father.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   Keep them in your name, the name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are.
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   While I was with them, I was keeping them in your name, which you have given me.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   I guarded them, and not one of them perished, but the son of perdition, so that the Scriptures would be fulfilled.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   But now I come to you, and these things I speak into the world, so that they may have my joy made full in themselves.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   I have given them your word, and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   I do not ask you to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil one.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   Sanctify them in the truth. Your word is truth.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   As you sent me into the world, I also sent them into the world.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   For their sake I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   Let's take a moment to pause there.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   Jesus essentially is giving a summary of what's happened so far.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   And the intent of God that God has expressed.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   The purpose of God that God has sent Christ for.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   And what you see is this constant mentality, I am in you, you in me, we're like this.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   Right? I guess if I can mesh my fingers together into one, that would be more appropriate to the picture.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   And the constant repeated idea is, everything you have desired me to do, I have done.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   This is the kind of loyalty. This is the kind of faithfulness.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   I want you to think about that in terms of now, quickly thinking through.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   That is a model, very much so of what we are following.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   Right? For us, when we think about our loyalties to God, I want to ask you those categorical questions.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   Those questions of, Lord, I want to be about your business. I want to be about you.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   I want us to be one in this. I want us, essentially, to have such an existence on this world,
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   where everything is through you, for you, by you, in you, of you.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   It's from you, every other preposition you can possibly think about.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   And this is the idea of Christ's existing in a way by which there's nothing done here apart from God.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   This is the kind of loyalty and faithfulness Jesus has to the Lord. Right?
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   And so, this is kind of an age-old struggle that every single one of us have.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   Where rather than operating in this fashion where there is loyalty, where there is faithfulness,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   we regularly try and do, well, in terms of my workplace, I'm a completely different person working apart from you,
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   working beside you, beside as in not next to you, but outside of you, doing my own thing.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   And then on Sundays, I come to you running back.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   That's an entirely different picture. You see what I'm saying?
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   And so, I want to give you this admonition. The Lord wants us to be tied in such a way,
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   and this is the best example I can give. Again, the marriage example is so frequently used in the Scripture.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   You know how once you're tied with somebody, even when you're dating, you come to church,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   and then people ask you, "Hey, where's your other person?" Right?
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   If there's Billy dating Betty, it's like, "Hey, where's Betty?" Right?
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   And you should know. Sorry, don't mean you.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   I just use the word Billy and Betty a lot, okay?
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   But I want you to think about that. To you, the Christian,
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   your faithfulness in terms of your relationship should be so tight,
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   the question regularly is, your awareness of God, your walking with God,
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   is you expect the two to be together always. Right?
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   And that's what I'm talking about. I want to give you this interesting, like, thought.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   Hosea, just listen to these words.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   In Hosea 2, verses 19-20, we know that the Scripture used this book,
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   we know that God used this prophet, to model what was to be God's relationship with His people.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   So listen carefully. God says, "I will betroth you to Me forever."
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   Yes. "I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and in justice,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   in loving kindness and compassion. I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   Then you will know the Lord."
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   I find that pretty incredible.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   To think about the way God is thinking about us,
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   He is thinking about us in that light,
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   where He has created union between us and Him.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   And that union is supposed to be characterized by such loyalty.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   And yet it has been the sin of mankind, and the sin of the people of God,
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   the sin of the nation of Israel, and the sin of Christians in this day,
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   where there's all kinds of adulterous behavior,
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   not just by way of selling yourself, like perhaps in this scenario in Hosea, as a harlot,
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   but in ways in which we act so many different ways.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   For example, there are so many times when although, yes, as a married couple,
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   you should be finding your protection and your unity in that harmony,
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   but rather people want to find protection elsewhere.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   We're supposed to experience intimacy, affection within that relationship,
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   but we long for it elsewhere.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   We're supposed to find acceptance, a sense of belonging within that relationship,
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   but we're happy to find it elsewhere.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   Those things that I just described to you,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   those are all absolute contrary antonyms of loyalty, right?
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   But this has been the mark of mankind for so long.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   And so that's why Scripture says in James 4,
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   He asked this question about where is the source of your quarrels and conflicts among you?
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   Do you not dissource your pleasures that wage war in your members?
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   You lust and do not have, so you commit murder.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   You are envious and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   You do not have because you do not ask.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   You ask and do not receive because you ask with wrong motives,
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   so that you may spend it on yourselves.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   And then he says this, "You adulteresses,
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God?
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   Therefore, whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God?
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   Do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose?
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   He jealously desires the spirit which he has made to dwell in us."
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   I want you to just reflect on that for a moment there
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   because that, again, this point one about thinking ourselves as reserved for God
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   is going to be to you one of the most powerful ways of framing
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   and having a mentality through all the decisions of your life.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   Yes?
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   I want you to think in such a way where whenever you're engaged in a certain activity
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   and you've got that little voice in your head that says, "Maybe this isn't wise."
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   If you simply ask the question, "Is this wise?"
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   your mind can go into all sorts of different rationales.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   "But if I do this, I could get this. But if I do this, I'm going to get hurt.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   But if I do this," and we calculate so quickly.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   If you ask the question, "Is this right? Is this permissible?"
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   your mind will quickly go into, "Well, he did it."
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   And then you will rationalize the fact that this is all permissible.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   The Scripture challenges us to think beyond those categories of asking ourselves,
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   "Is it simply the norm, permissible? Have people done this before?"
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   The Scripture is commanding us to ask an altogether different question.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   "Does this communicate my loyalty to my love?"
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   And that's an altogether different question.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   That's my exhortation to you.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   Is the decision I'm about to make right now, is it communicating loyalty?
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   Is it communicating this kind of sentiment?
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   And again, it's between, let's say, me and my wife.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   Could I go and hang out with another woman if I wanted to?
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   As a pastor, truth be told, sometimes it's weird, right?
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000]   Because people ask me for advice, and I'll say, "Come to church."
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   And then we meet out in like the cafe or something like that.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   But imagine if I decided, "Well, why don't I take you to with Chris?"
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   You would think that was just absolutely silly, right?
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   So the thing about it is, is that permissible?
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   We're just getting food.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   Your mind can so rationalize anything. Why?
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   If Bia is actually not in the picture,
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   and you start simplifying things down to a pure base of what it is,
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   you can rationalize anything.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   But if I'm thinking about the heart of my wife,
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   will she be jealous for me?
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   That's an entirely different question.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   Have you ever asked that?
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   Have you ever thought to that extent?
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   James says, "You realize God will be jealous for your heart
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   because he gave you the new heart.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   He gave you that opportunity to exist with him in that love relationship
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   as a unified spouse-husband relationship."
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   In your decision-making, have you gone to ask the question,
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   "Would my love feel jealous for me if I did this?"
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   So people could ask all sorts of questions.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   Should I go here? Should I go there?
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   Should I do this? Should I do that?
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   These are some questions you could ask to check your heart,
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   but not only check your heart, but to consider,
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   "Lord, if you were here right next to me,
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   and you were as real as my wife,
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   you were as real as my spouse,
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   would you be jealous because I did this?
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   Would you question my loyalty?
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   That will cause us to live in a completely different manner."
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   And so that quickly makes me move to my next point, point number three,
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   which is the Christian who is growing in maturity,
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   in practical holiness, daily decisions,
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   is the person who's going to be able to discern
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   and be readily aware of what pleases and displeases his Lord.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   So my question to you, when we're thinking about holiness applied,
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000]   my question is not just simply, "Do you know what to do, what not to do in every situation?"
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   The question more so is, "Do you have a sense of what pleases my Lord?
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   Do you have a sense also of what displeases my Lord?"
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   And this is something that our Lord Jesus is readily aware.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   In the example of Christ, Christ said very clearly,
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   "This is the will of my Father, that he loses nothing."
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   "This is the will of my Father, that this life-giving faith,
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   this truth of the gospel be given to them,
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   so that they may have life and that they may be one with us."
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   Jesus is so clear on the will of God.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   "You have willed this from eternity. You have willed this from long ago.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   You have sent me for this purpose. This is your agenda.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   This is your business, and my food is to do the will of my Father."
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   Our Lord is crystal clear.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   When he sees the temple, my Lord does not like this. Right?
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   My Lord will be enraged by this.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   When he sees the week, my Lord will have compassion on this.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   Our Savior is so in tune with the will of God.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   Turn your Bibles to Ephesians 5, verse 18, because this chapter,
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   Ephesians 5, actually I'm going to highlight several verses from us.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   Just turn over to Ephesians and go to chapter 5.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   I'm going to read various passages just within it.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   First passage I'm going to read is Ephesians 5, verse 1, where it says,
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   "Therefore, be imitators of God as beloved children and walk in love,
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   just as Christ also loved you and gave himself up for us,
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant offering."
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   Take a look at this.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   As he talks about everything you're supposed to put off
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   and everything you're supposed to put on,
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   what he says in verse 10 is this.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   I'm going to start reading actually in verse 9.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   "For the fruit of the light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth,
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord."
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   Scan your eyes to verse 15.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   He says, "Therefore, be careful how you walk, not as unwise but as wise,
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   making the most of your time because the days are evil."
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   Verse 17, "So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is."
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   There are times when people want to know very specifically.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   Is it God's will for me to take this job?
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   There are times when people ask very specific questions.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   Is it God's will for me to date this person?
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   There are some times we want to know exactly what he wants me to do
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   in a supernatural way.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   Help me make this decision.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   Just tell me what to do.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   But instead, a lot of times what the Lord wants you to know
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   is not just simply the minutiae of the detail of the decision to be made.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   He wants you to understand his good pleasure.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   He wants you to be able to gauge what causes his displeasure.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   So when you see various things that are happening in the world,
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.000]   there is a time and a place for everything.
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   There's a time for you to be in great joy and happiness that things are happening,
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   but there's a time for you to be upset and indignant about the things that are happening.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   How do you tell the difference?
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   The way you tell the difference is going to be, "Would God be pleased by this?
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   Would be this to him pleasurable in his eyes?
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   Or is this something that the Lord detests?"
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   I want you to think about the way that people love each other.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   And the fact of the matter is two individuals who have walked with each other in intimacy,
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   two individuals who really know each other, can already predict,
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   "Oh, no, no, no. My spouse is going to hate that shirt, right?
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   Oh, no, no, no. My spouse is going to love that food.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   Oh, no, no. My spouse is going to hate that stuff."
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   Why? Because as you walk together, you are so in tune with your likes and dislikes
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   that you can already tell. Yes?
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   And so that's my question to you.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   If you want to grow in practical holiness in your life,
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   are you growing in the things that the Lord has said, "I love these things"?
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   The Lord has said so many times in Scripture, "These things are precious to me."
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   A meek individual who knows how to be humble.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   "These things are absolutely abhorrent abominations to me.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   Your haughty eyes that look up at me like, 'What in the world are you doing, God?'"
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   God hates that attitude.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   And we should hate it too.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   God loves to see the precious ladies who are meek, gentle, hardworking, wise, industrious.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   He says this is a jewel.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   Men who are responsible, strong, convicted, principled, and willing to serve,
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   willing to carry in the burdens of others.
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   He says, "Good job."
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   Those things should ring in our ear regularly.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   Those things should be to us like our sensitive palates
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   for us to grow in practical holiness.
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   And then as we think about that, now I want to move to point four.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   The holiness that we should seek should constantly transform the desires of our heart.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   As we think about what is palatable to us,
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   what we are comfortable accepting,
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   what we are okay with having exist in our lives,
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   I am challenging you, you should know the will of God,
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   and you should be able to say, "Uh-uh, that stuff cannot be here."
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   It's like, "Yes, more of that, please."
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   But clearly, in the end, this should absolutely transform our tastes.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   Every single one of us, we can do that.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   Some of you hated pho when you were young.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   You said it smelled like feet, you said it smelled like sweat,
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   you hated the fact that when the server came by, his thumb was always in the soup.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   And then now, you love the smell.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   [sniffs]
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   [groans]
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   It's on you when you come out of the restaurant, and you love it.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   And if the waiter's thumb is not in the soup,
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   you're like, "That's not authentic."
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   It's not OG from Westminster.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   It grows on us.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   There are so many things, actually, that grow on us in our palate.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   The thing about it is, for us, what is to somebody who is mature
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   is the individual whose tastes are actually refined.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   And what is pleasurable to him has become the things of God.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   A lot of us, we're struggling because we know in theory,
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   I know I'm supposed to like that stuff.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   Let's be real, okay?
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   I'm in the struggle of Christianity.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   I know I'm supposed to enjoy that stuff.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   Truth be told, it's hard.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   Truth be told, it can be dry as a bone.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   Truth be told, sometimes it actually is painful.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   Truth be told, sometimes it's very displeasurable.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   Yes?
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   And what we need to do is continue to approach the Lord and say,
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   "God, grow in me this heart that is changing both physically,
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   both spiritually, both mentally, and of the spirit,
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   where my taste buds are being transformed,
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   that my palate is being matured and refined to the degree that my desires
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   match yours, and what is pleasing to me, what is feeding my soul,
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   are the things that the Lord desires."
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   Go back in your Bible to that passage in John 17,
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   and I want you to think about this,
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   this idea of the desire of the heart,
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   this idea of a mature palate.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   Jesus, remember, is praying to God before his ultimate sacrifice.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   Jesus in this moment is agonizing, yes?
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   He's going through incredible difficulty preparing his mind and his heart,
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   and he prays.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   And what he says is this, verse 20.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   So we left off having read up to verse 19,
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   and we read in verse 20,
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   "I do not ask on behalf of these things alone,
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   but for those who believe in me through their word,
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   that they may be one even as you, Father, are in me and I in you.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000]   They also may be in us,
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   so that the world may believe that you sent me."
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   Verse 22.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   "The glory which you have given me, I have given to them,
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   that they may be one just as we are one.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   I in them and you in me,
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   that they may be perfected in unity,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   so that the world may know that you sent me,
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   and love them even as you have loved me.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   be with me where I am,
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   so that they may see my glory which you have given me,
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   for you loved me before the foundation of the world.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   O righteous Father, although the world has not yet known you,
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   yet I have known you,
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   and these have known that you have sent me.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   And I have made your name known to them,
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   and I will make it known,
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   so that the love with which you love me may be in them and I in them."
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   I never thought about it this way.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   I always thought of it as because Jesus is agonizing to go to the cross,
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   this is where Jesus is receiving the spiritual strength
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   to go and do that which is impossible,
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   which is an innocent man bear the penalty and die for sinners like them.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]   But you read it again and again,
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   and you realize actually Jesus is pouring his heart out
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   in terms of what he wants from the Father.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   Have you ever thought of it that way?
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   Jesus is expressing to his Father,
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   "God, what I want you to fulfill is this amazing plan that is both in us
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   that we share our glory with these people.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   And these souls that we love,
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   we want to gather them in such a way
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   that they're literally engulfed in us."
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   I'm thinking, "Wow."
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   And so when I sing songs of like,
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   "Lord, your heart is so good, your intention is so kind,"
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   these are the passages I think about.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   Yes?
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   God's desire is profound.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   And what's to us our growing maturity
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   is to take our desires and grow
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   and rise to the stature of Christ.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   This is our prayer.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   Confession.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   After a long week of hard work, you know what I like?
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   You know what I desire?
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   I like stuff.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   I shared with this one group, my Bible study group,
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   I did the whole like look at my screen time thing.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   Do you know what it says?
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   It's so funny.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   I'll just do another one for you now.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   Two hours and 20 minutes on shopping and food.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   So sad.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   Two hours, and you guys,
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   I feel so blessed at this church
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   because people know like you pastors and elders
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   must be really busy, of which we are.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   Very little sleep and our days just keep running.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   But I confess, after I'm done working,
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   you know what I like?
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   Stuff and food.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   (laughing)
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   I want to read to you this ridiculous passage.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   Go in your Bibles to Hosea, please,
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   and go back to Hosea chapter two.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   This passage just rebuked me to the core.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   Okay.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   Go in your Bibles to Hosea chapter two, verse 21.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   Remember how I told you that God,
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   because of the relationship he established with us,
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   he is thinking on a jealousy level.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   He is thinking on a married, loyal, devout, unified level.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   And he exemplified that in Hosea.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   And what's really ridiculous to me
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   is what he describes as the sin of Hosea.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   Not Hosea.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   Hosea is the prophet.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   The name escapes me all of a sudden.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   I said, "Go."
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   Thank you.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   Take a look at this passage, Hosea chapter two, verse 21.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   It will come about, so this is verse 21 of chapter two.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   It will come about in that day
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   that I will respond to the pleasure of the Lord.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   I will respond to the heavens,
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   and they will respond to the earth,
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   and the earth will respond to the grain,
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   to the new wine, and to the oil,
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   and they will respond to Jezreel.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   I will sow her to myself in the land,
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   and I will also have compassion on her
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   who had not obtained compassion.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   And I will say to those who were not my people,
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   "You're my people."
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   And they will say, "You are my God."
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   Take a moment to pause right there.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   This scenario that he's describing is a future scenario,
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   and it's ridiculous.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   It's appalling.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000]   You know why?
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   Because what he says is he's going to call out to his people,
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   but they're going to call out to somebody else.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   But nevertheless, he's going to plant them,
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   and he's going to have compassion on them,
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   and he's going to give them such a mercy
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   that he's going to allow them still to be called his people,
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   and he will let them call him their God.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   Mind-blowing.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   It goes on.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   Then the Lord said to me, "Go again.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   Love a woman who is loved by her husband,
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000]   yet an adulteress, because that's the scenario.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   Even as the Lord loves the sons of Israel,
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes."
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   What?
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   [laughs]
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   I read that, and I laughed so hard.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000]   These adulterous people, I love them to death.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   They're calling somebody else's name,
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   which is, again, such, such perverse stuff.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   I love a woman who is an adulteress,
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   giving herself to other people.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   They turn to other gods, and they love raisin cakes.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   And then I think about, "Ah, sometimes in my fleshly state,
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   I am so pitiful because my simple desires make me so unholy.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   It is not very hard to entice me to be unfaithful to my God, is it?"
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   All somebody has to do--you guys pretty much know my sins
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   because I've confessed them many times on this pulpit.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   You know I like cars, and so if you dangle, like,
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   "Maybe you could drive this nice car,"
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   maybe I would think, "Maybe I can."
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   If only I just spent less time with ministry, less time with family.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   I could add that hobby to my schedule.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   Why not?
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   There was this weird, weird day.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   You're so tired.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   You come home.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   Things don't go your way.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   And so all you want is to veg.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   All you want is to enjoy a hobby that you like.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   And then in my heart, I think, "What's wrong with that?"
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   So then you allow yourself to fantasize about having such and such thing,
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   and then there's frustration.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   Why?
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   Because such and such thing costs a lot of money.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   And then so you think, "Oh, I can't have that."
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   But then if I change my course of life, and I get another job,
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   and I get another career, I could have that.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   I'm a hardworking man.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   To you, it might sound strange, this weird flow of thought that goes from,
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   "All I wanted was this," and then it moves to changing my entire trajectory of life.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   But that's the nature of man.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   So in that way, one of the great battles we will have to do
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   is to make sure that we address from the infancy level
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   what in your mind is so desirable,
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   what little raisin cakes are so tasty,
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   that we would be sometimes willing to compromise,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   potentially test our God with jealousy,
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   and sometimes even to change the entire trajectory of our lives.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   Because can it happen?
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   Yes.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   You guys know that, like, there have been times you, here,
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   have counseled young men and women who wanted to be faithful,
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   but all they did was every time finals came around,
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   they just jettisoned God.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   And then they kept that compromise up until they ended up getting a job.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   So every time there was a project due, they jettisoned God.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   And the next thing you know, all of a sudden, they stop coming to church.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   And the next thing you know, all of a sudden, they're so guilty,
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   they feel so, I guess, ashamed, they don't even want to show up.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   How many people have we walked with,
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   where just a simple desire to get an A on that one paper
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   was the compromise needed
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   in order to set the trajectory for every other compromise they'll make?
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   Now, my point in sharing that stuff is not just to make, let's say,
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   us feel guilty about times we struggled to manage our schedule.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   Because we do this struggle every week.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   Every week we do this struggle.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   But my challenge is not so much, oh, if you've ever just stayed up late
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   and you worked hard on your paper to feel guilty.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   No, no, no, no.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   My challenge is at that moment when you're struggling,
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000]   make sure you're checking your heart.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   Lord, as I'm doing this, I have responsibilities,
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   and there are some things I need to do, and I need to get it done.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   But in terms of my heart, I'm going to ask this question.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   Is there such a desire in me?
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   Is it evident in me to a degree,
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   for clearly what I'm pursuing is not of you?
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   Is there such a desire in me that is not mature?
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   Is there such a desire in me that's less than the kind of faithful,
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   loyal, humble, and devoted kind of love
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   that I should be expressing towards you?
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   Those are questions you should be asking yourself.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   And yes, although those questions are hard to answer,
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   and yes, although sometimes it feels like all you're doing is being skeptical,
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   it's good to test your heart. Amen?
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   And what I want to challenge you today is when it comes down to a kind of holiness
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   that is of a practical growing maturity,
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.000]   it is individuals who have wrestled on that level
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   that can offer up their mature desires.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   When Jesus says, "Ask of me anything,"
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   the lifted up desires of our hearts are going to be like Christ.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000]   "Lord, what I desire are things of,
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000]   I want to present my brother so pure in Christ.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   Lord, I desire my unity with you.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   Lord, I desire this church to be edified.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000]   Lord, I desire this truth to be proclaimed.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000]   Lord, I desire my Savior to be exalted.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   I desire," and your list can go on and on and on,
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000]   and everything God hears is, "That's so sweet."
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   That's what I picture in my head.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   That when God rips open my chest and He's looking at,
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   "What are you longing for? I want to give it to you,"
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   He's not thinking, "A beat-up car? That's what you want?"
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   When He rips open my heart to see, it's like, "Do you want food?
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000]   You like camp gear that much?"
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   When He looks at the longing of my heart and He opens it in to see,
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   and He says, "I want to give that to you
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   because the affections and the things that you're seeking
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   are right after my heart."
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   That, bringing all things together here,
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000]   that kind of heart is the heart that is most like God.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   That kind of heart is the heart that is most like our Savior,
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000]   and that's the kind of practical holiness
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000]   that is truly set apart to the Lord. Amen?
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   I hope then that you could take these principles,
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000]   and rather than me having to say, "Go through the Galatians.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.000]   Here are the fruits of your flesh.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   Are you immoral and doing X, Y, and Z?
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   Are you given to sensuality and doing X, Y, and Z?
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   Are you doing things that are adulterous?"
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   You would frame every single one of these things into,
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   "Am I pleasing my Lord?
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   Am I causing my Lord to hear from me my devotion,
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000]   my pure sincerity?
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.000]   I love you, and all of me is yours.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000]   Or am I presenting to my God a kind of sacrifice
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   that is riddled with all of this stuff,
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000]   anger, dispute, dissensions, and factions?"
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   So you take those questions,
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000]   and you apply them to the decisions that are being made.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   You take those questions,
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   and you apply them to the struggles you have in your heart.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   And I believe that when you make decisions that way,
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000]   the Lord is not so concerned about,
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   "Oh, in the end, you did it right."
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   But how you came to those conclusions are going to be,
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   "You really considered me as significant in your life.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000]   You really considered me as so important
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.000]   that you did the hard work of asking if I would be pleased."
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   I genuinely believe our Heavenly Father,
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   that's the faith He's looking for.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000]   Let's pray.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:05.000]   Lord God, we thank you
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   that you are leading us to maturity, to growth.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   And I pray, as the Scriptures say,
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   that you will cause us to keep walking this path
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000]   where we are following your lead
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   and your will for us to be sanctified.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]   And you have said in Scripture
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000]   that you are going to work all things in the church.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   You're going to use this body
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   so that we will rise to unity in Christ
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.000]   in such a way that we are all growing to the measure of Christ,
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   into the fullness of His stature,
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   into His maturity and holiness.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000]   And I pray, Father God, just as the Lord Jesus,
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   His heart was so in tune with you.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   He spoke your words.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000]   He accomplished your work.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000]   He was about your priorities.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   He was about your glory.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   And He cared not to be a respecter of man.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000]   But, God, He always feared you,
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000]   and He entrusted Himself to you.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000]   I pray, Father God, our goal is that.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   And I ask, Lord, and we have confidence in you
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   as our Heavenly Father, we know you will lead us in all things.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   Lord, I pray right now for if there's any brother or sister here
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000]   that is struggling with doubt,
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   struggling against their flesh,
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000]   and perhaps even failing in so many ways,
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   may they experience such a grace
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000]   as is mentioned in the book of Hosea.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   You call us, Lord,
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   and then your desire and heart for us is to be sanctified to you.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   Let them know that and experience that.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   And, God, I pray that any individual struggling
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000]   would hear this prayer of Jesus,
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000]   that, God, you would guard us and protect us in your name,
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000]   that, Lord, we're so secure, we are bound up in you.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000]   So, God, in this way I pray that they would be encouraged,
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   and in this way they would be motivated,
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   that above and beyond any failure,
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000]   Lord, we can continue to pursue your righteousness.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000]   For, Lord, you are a gracious God. We thank you in Christ's name. Amen.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   Why don't we all stand for the response song?
