[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:31.400]   - All right, good morning
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.400]   and welcome to Brain Community Church.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.520]   Let me get to our announcements first.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.240]   First of all, as you guys were coming in,
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.360]   you saw a table out there that's set up
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.680]   with some stationary stuff.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.160]   We have a sister in our church, Tanya,
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.920]   who's working for 316 Printing
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.040]   and they have donated some materials.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.880]   There's a men and women's journal,
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.640]   calendar and various things.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.840]   And so if you walk out to the right
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.780]   of the entrance of the cafe,
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.560]   they're gonna have boxes set up.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.640]   So if you wanna go grab that,
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.080]   again, please don't hoard it.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.800]   Just take what you need,
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.760]   but they're gonna be out there
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.580]   just giving that out for free.
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.720]   Another announcement they asked to make clear is
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.660]   if you have anything lost and found,
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.340]   they've designated a spot
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.740]   as you're going into the cafe, turn left.
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:23.180]   So if you remember, during Christmas,
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.860]   that's where we had our Christmas tree set up.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.600]   So if you lost anything and you need to find it,
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.900]   it's gonna be over there.
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.220]   So just go into that room and turn sharp left
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.100]   and that's where all the stuff
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.900]   is just gonna be stationed.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.340]   And one other thing is,
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.060]   I know that brain couponers is very popular
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.520]   and a lot of people are just kinda exchanging stuff
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.220]   and it's great and we don't wanna
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.220]   hinder that, we wanna encourage sharing
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.060]   and that kinda stuff.
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.100]   But we're having issues with people
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.180]   just dropping off stuff that's just somewhere at church
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.380]   and come pick it up and then people don't pick it up.
[00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.980]   So what ends up happening is we have things that,
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.780]   I'm not gonna say it looks like trash,
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.620]   but things that we're not sure if it's trash or not
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.620]   are scattered around the church
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.620]   and we don't know whose it is.
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.940]   Is it lost, is it what it is?
[00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:11.940]   So we need you guys to hand that off to each other,
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.080]   not say, hey, it's in front of the bathroom door
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.680]   so go make sure you go pick it up there
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.500]   or it's in the entrance of the sanctuary,
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.020]   just meet it up there and then somebody would forget
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.380]   and it's just sitting out there.
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.840]   So what ends up happening is we're gonna think it's lost
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.880]   or it's trash or it's a gift to us.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.040]   So basically, if you're gonna exchange things,
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.960]   make sure that you exchange it with that person personally
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.500]   and make sure that the other person has taken it.
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.540]   But we have too many things that are just kinda
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.900]   lying around, we don't know what to do with.
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.520]   And so we have some habits that we've had
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.740]   when our church was smaller and we just kinda retained it
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.620]   as our church got bigger and because of the size
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.100]   of the church, we just can't do that anymore.
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.020]   So make sure if you're gonna exchange things
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.160]   that you're gonna exchange it personally.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.900]   Make sure that person gets it or keep it in your car
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.080]   and then make sure they come to your car
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.580]   and get it afterwards, okay?
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.580]   All right, there's a child safety training
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.740]   that's happening today at 1 to 140.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.500]   And so if you are working with children
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.820]   or possibly gonna work with children in the future,
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.100]   that training is for you today.
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.900]   So this is a mandatory thing for anyone
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.400]   who is working in our children's department.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.100]   So that's gonna be taking place today at one o'clock.
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:24.620]   Then heads up, next week is communion service,
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.780]   just to prepare for that.
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:28.180]   And then one last announcement for today is,
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.940]   today is the abortion seminar and it's gonna be taking place
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.220]   at 1.45 p.m.
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.500]   So even if you haven't signed up,
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.860]   you're welcome to come to that.
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.980]   We are gonna be having it in this room.
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.700]   And so right at 1.45, we're gonna try to start
[00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.220]   right at 1.45 and then after Pastor Mark
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.100]   gives his presentation, there will be a time for Q&A
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.580]   and open Q&A so you can come in prepared for that as well.
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.140]   It's gonna last about an hour and a half
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.940]   so if you need to prepare anything after that.
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.740]   But again, even if you haven't signed up
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.980]   and if you did sign up, obviously, 1.45 sharp,
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:02.620]   we're gonna be starting in this room, in the sanctuary, okay?
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.560]   All right, this morning, I'm gonna pray for us
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.620]   for the offering.
[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.580]   If you had issues with Zelle,
[00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.780]   if you were trying to give offering
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.300]   and you were rejected for some reason,
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.900]   having some problems, well, we had some issues last week.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.140]   We're in the process of changing bank accounts
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.300]   and that kind of stuff and so as a result,
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.740]   some things kinda didn't work last week.
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.980]   So it should be up and running.
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.260]   If you had some problems last week and you were waiting,
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:29.100]   it should be okay.
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.060]   But if you try today and for some reason,
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.900]   it gets rejected, please let us know.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.160]   It should have been fixed.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.820]   And so I'll forward it to our finance department
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.380]   and they'll be able to take a look at that.
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.460]   But otherwise, that's what was going on in the background.
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.020]   If you have a physical offering, again,
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.220]   we have a physical box in the back as you are leaving,
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.860]   you'll see that.
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.300]   And then after the offering, our sister Jennifer
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.060]   is gonna come up, give her testimony
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.860]   and she'll be baptized today, okay?
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:56.700]   Let's pray.
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.300]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.620]   for the privilege that we have to come and worship you.
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:15.120]   Lord, help us so that what we do
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:19.500]   is not simply out of habit, that it's not superstition,
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.760]   but that you would open our eyes to continue
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.480]   to see a greater and greater glimpse of the gospel,
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.520]   the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:34.980]   Help us to learn to love you, to obey you,
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.980]   to follow you, Lord God, in all things.
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.860]   That this morning would be a reminder, Lord,
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.860]   of your presence in our lives.
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.580]   I pray that you would bless the offering,
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.500]   may it be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.220]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.420]   (gentle piano music)
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:56.340]   (gentle piano music continues)
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:00.260]   (gentle piano music continues)
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:04.180]   (gentle piano music continues)
[00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.660]   (gentle piano music continues)
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:12.580]   (gentle piano music continues)
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.740]   Church family, let's all rise together.
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:39.880]   As we sing this next song,
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.180]   I just wanna read this verse to you,
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.880]   if you can follow along in Psalm 27, one through three.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.100]   It says, "The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.740]   "Whom shall I fear?
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.760]   "The Lord is the stronghold of my life.
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.920]   "Of whom shall I be afraid?
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.800]   "When the wicked advance against me to devour me,
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.620]   "it is my enemies and my foes who will stumble and fall.
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.740]   "Though an army beseech me, my heart will not fear.
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.000]   "The war break out against me.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.960]   "Even then, I will be confident."
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.160]   As we sing this song about the Lord's salvation,
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.120]   what we have in Christ, I know a room this size,
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.280]   there are many people dealing with many different things,
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.360]   whether that is good, whether that is bad.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.280]   But this song will convey to us the truth
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.480]   that the Lord is my salvation, whether good or bad.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.480]   So I encourage us, as we sing these songs,
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.480]   we are intentional in trying to teach our church
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.640]   that these principles that are in our songs
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.600]   that we can take with us wherever we go.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.120]   There's a melody to it, and hopefully over time,
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.960]   you'll be able to memorize these melodies in these songs.
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:51.520]   (gentle piano music)

[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.960]   (soft music)
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:43.960]  , good worship, sorry.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:48.960]  , hi everyone.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.560]   My name is Jennifer, for those of you guys
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:19.360]   that don't know me, I'm gonna be sharing my testimony today.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:24.360]   So, sorry, oh no, okay.
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:29.500]   So I was born into a Christian family,
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:34.800]   growing up I didn't realize, oh God,
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.740]   I haven't even started, sorry.
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.200]   And I didn't realize what a blessing this was
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.860]   and how it would play a significant role
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.160]   in forming the foundation of my faith
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.700]   until later in college.
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:31:00.920]   Because my parents were heavily involved in the church,
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.680]   I naturally followed their footsteps
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.160]   and my life began to revolve around church activities.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.080]   So I served in nearly all the church related activities
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.660]   and events and I began to equate my involvement
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.220]   in the church to my spiritual maturity.
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.480]   So I grew up very sheltered and I didn't realize
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.960]   what a blessing it was at the time.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.260]   Rather I became curious at the secular lifestyles,
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.240]   my friends were living and slowly began
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.800]   to partake in their activities.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.680]   So at first I was in denial and wanted to use the excuse
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.160]   that I was being a light and witness,
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.520]   but as I compromised more of my values,
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.320]   my heart became calloused and this culminated
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:41.560]   into a stage of rebellion and indulgence in my flesh.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:45.880]   The irony was that I was partaking in the very activities
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.860]   I had so severely judged once before
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:50.920]   and the deep sins and desires that were hidden away
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.920]   in my heart came to light.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.160]   Much like the prodigal son, what felt pleasurable
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:59.260]   and enjoyable at first quickly turned to a time of despair.
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:04.260]   My destructive lifestyle began to take a toll on my academics
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.240]   while relationships helped health and well-being.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:26.840]   As I saw myself compromise more of my values,
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:36.100]   I realized the extent of my sins and fleshly desires.
[00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.120]   (sniffling)
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:44.260]   And I began to lose hope under the weight of my richness.
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:47.320]   Rather than returning to the one that could save me,
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.300]   however, I chose to numb myself
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:54.140]   and it wasn't until after a traumatizing event
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.300]   where I wanted to escape my physical body
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.700]   that my mental state deteriorated
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.980]   and I began to feel empty and disinterested
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.080]   in life altogether.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.340]   (sniffling)
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:19.400]   As I began to sink deeper into my depression,
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.320]   I reached the brink of no return
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.000]   and I knew I could no longer continue on this path.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:33.500]   By God's grace, I experienced godly grief
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.200]   and I finally came to terms that even though
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.320]   I had wandered so far, I would do whatever it takes
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.720]   to repent from my worldly ways
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.480]   and pursue a relationship with Christ.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.960]   So as I began to pray, more and more of my sins
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.400]   were made painfully aware to me
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:51.320]   in the ways I'd been placing my self-value
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:55.800]   in validation of people, sought comfort in destructive ways,
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.640]   prioritized my own selfish greed
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:01.740]   and ultimately wanted to be in control of my own life.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.920]   As I felt the depths of my sin and my wretchedness,
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.120]   I felt an increasing chasm between myself
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.560]   and a perfect and holy God
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.480]   and I was shattered at how undeserving I was
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.340]   of his gift of grace and salvation.
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:18.480]   Although I'd grown up hearing about Jesus
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.640]   dying on the cross for us, at this moment,
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:22.760]   I felt to my core the cost of my sins.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:28.640]   The fact that a perfect and sinless God
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.920]   would send his only son to die for my sins
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.440]   and that he alone would be victorious over sin
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.740]   once and for all in his resurrection
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.800]   compelled me to surrender my life to him.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.700]   I committed to take up my cross daily and follow.
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:46.760]   This perfect God not only loved me so much,
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:50.560]   I'm sorry,
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:56.060]   that he knew every hair on my head,
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.720]   and died on my behalf,
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.560]   but wanted me a broken and once hopeless sinner.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:10.880]   I remember sobbing as I sat in awe of his presence
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.400]   with the realization that I was no less deserving
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:18.220]   of God's mercy and grace,
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:23.920]   whether I was doing all the right Christian things
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.480]   or living in worldly pleasures.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.720]   It was never my actions that had earned my salvation,
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.960]   but God's grace and his grace alone.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.240]   His love and faithfulness that never wavered
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.600]   because of his character was beyond what I could comprehend.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.800]   Yet the battle had just begun,
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.160]   as I had to face the consequences of deeply rooted sins
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.360]   and the process of being purified and sanctified
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.040]   that was and is so brutal.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:55.800]   However, I trust and rely on the Holy Spirit
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.960]   that resides within me for strength and perseverance
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.720]   and cling to the hope that one day I'll be reunited
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.920]   with my Lord and Savior.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.920]   The foundation that was laid
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.060]   through all my years of attending church as a child
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:12.040]   began to have deeper meaning as I experienced firsthand
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.780]   the peace that transcends all understanding,
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:18.040]   as well as discovering what it means to have true joy
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.560]   and contentment in God alone.
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.320]   Over the next several years,
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.360]   I had the privilege to partake in several mission trips
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:27.640]   where my faith in him grew through further encounters
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:30.680]   and glimpses of his glory and love for his people.
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.080]   As God's love overwhelmed and transformed me,
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.880]   I wanted every aspect of my life with God in the center.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:41.400]   I no longer found satisfaction indulging in my sin
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.120]   or felt bound to my old life,
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:46.240]   but rather became a slave to pursuing righteousness.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.700]   Every day I rely on his new mercies for me,
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.920]   and I'm still learning and experiencing who God is,
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.960]   his multifaceted characteristics of being a holy,
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.900]   righteous, loving, and merciful God,
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:03.680]   his purpose for his believers to share the gospel
[00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:07.200]   and what it means to be a light and a witness
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.960]   and to have his word as an anchor and compass for my life.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.960]   As I reflect on my life, God's faithfulness
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.120]   and his hand in my life is so apparent
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.680]   and strengthens me to keep fighting the good fight.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:23.200]   I just wanted to end with a verse from Psalm 717.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.660]   I'll give thanks to the Lord because of his righteousness.
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:29.120]   I will sing praises of the name of the Lord most high.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:29.960]   Thank you.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.120]   (audience applauding)
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.880]   (water gurgling)
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:53.840]   - Jennifer, do you understand when you go into the water,
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.360]   you're uniting with Christ's death,
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.200]   and when you come out,
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.880]   you're being united to his resurrected life?
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:58.720]   - Yes.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.960]   - And I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.300]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.720]   (whispering)
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:09.780]   (audience applauding)
[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:21.440]   - Thank you, Jennifer, for that testimony.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:23.400]   If you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:29.500]   to Luke chapter six, verses 12 through 16.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.520]   And as I mentioned,
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.120]   we're gonna be in this text for a few weeks.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:42.760]   My goal is to finish this text before I head out to Korea.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.760]   I'm not sure if that's gonna happen, okay?
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.560]   I didn't get to finish the sermon today
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.960]   in the first service.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.080]   Okay, so first, again, Luke chapter six,
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.200]   verse 12 through 16.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:59.000]   It was at this time that he went off to the mountain
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.040]   to pray, and he spent the whole night in prayer to God.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.440]   And when day came, he called his disciples to him
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:08.440]   and chose 12 of them, whom he also named as apostles.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:12.420]   Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew, his brother,
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:15.240]   and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.080]   and Matthew and Thomas, James, the son of Aphaias,
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.680]   and Simon, who was called the Zealot.
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.960]   Judas, the son of James, and Judas Iscariot,
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.600]   who became a traitor.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.440]   Let's pray.
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.040]   (audience member whistling)
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.140]   Father, we come before you to hear from you,
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:35.680]   not just an explanation of the text,
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.360]   but to know your heart, your purpose, your reason,
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.840]   not only for your disciples, but for us.
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.440]   We pray, Father God, that you give us understanding.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:49.820]   And even beyond that, give us an eagerness
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:52.760]   to hear from you, to see your glory,
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.800]   and that we may be changed and become more and more
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.900]   like Christ in every way, inside and out.
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.920]   We pray for your blessing and your Holy Spirit
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.160]   to empower us, illuminate us, to teach us and guide us.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.820]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:10.220]   So as we've been talking about up to this point,
[00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.600]   just to understand the context,
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:16.320]   that Jesus has been systematically challenging
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:18.760]   the religious status quo.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.600]   So the choosing of these 12 was a punch in the face
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.200]   to the leaders.
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.080]   He wasn't simply scanning to see what was wrong
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.700]   and pointing out, we need to tweak this,
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.880]   we need to change this, we need to do this.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.380]   He basically is tearing the whole system down
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.360]   and starting from scratch.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.880]   That the foundation of the new covenant in the church
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:41.600]   is gonna look vastly different than what was established.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.440]   And so this was not a small challenge.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.440]   He was basically telling not only the leaders,
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.640]   but all of Israel and even to us to this day,
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.520]   that the wisdom of this world that established
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.440]   the Jewish system was going to lead to destruction.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:03.380]   And so Christ comes and he not only challenges
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:06.640]   their tradition, but in the very choosing
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:10.620]   of these 12 disciples, he goes exactly opposite
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.080]   of what they would have done.
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:15.880]   And if you study the Bible carefully,
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.080]   you'll notice that this is what God's been doing
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.160]   all throughout history.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.040]   This is not unique to these 12 disciples.
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:25.100]   That God has been challenging their understanding
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:28.160]   of right and wrong, their understanding of power
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:32.640]   in order that they recognize that God is the one
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.640]   that they need to rely on.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.720]   Because it was their natural tendency
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:41.720]   to give credit to themselves, to give credit to man.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.560]   That's what it says in Romans chapter one,
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.460]   the core of their sin is that they have a tendency
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:49.460]   to create images that look like them
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.960]   so that they can worship it.
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.300]   And we see that all throughout.
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:55.080]   In fact, I could give you dozens of examples
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:58.200]   of the Old Testament, what God does to challenge the system.
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.320]   And I think one of the clearest examples,
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.800]   we find it in the story of Gideon in Judges chapter six
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.100]   and Judges chapter seven, where the Midianites
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.780]   were suppressing the Israelites
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:12.400]   and they were vastly outnumbered.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:18.400]   And God chooses, they said there are 32,000 men,
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:23.420]   and God says to Gideon that I'm not gonna deliver you
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:26.060]   with these 32,000 men because I know your tendency.
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.540]   I know what's gonna happen because if I deliver you,
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.600]   you're gonna take the credit.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.140]   You're gonna say because we were trained,
[00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.740]   because we had sharper swords,
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.500]   or because we have this or we have that,
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:41.580]   and so you're gonna think that those 32,000 mighty men
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.860]   were the reason why you conquered the Midianites.
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:47.180]   So he dwindles it down to 22,000.
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.780]   And then from 22,000, it's like yeah,
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:50.980]   this is still not small enough,
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:52.820]   so he dwindles it down to 10,000.
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:57.820]   And then from 10,000, he dwindles it down to 300 men.
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:01.300]   Now the odds between the 300 men
[00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:05.420]   and the number of Midianites would have been one to 750.
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.680]   750.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:11.340]   So in order for these 300 men to be successful,
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:15.500]   each person would have to slaughter 750 men.
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:20.580]   Now as you guys know, this is not a period of atomic bombs
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.660]   or machine guns or they have better weaponry
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:24.740]   or they have drones they can send
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.460]   and bomb their headquarters.
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:28.300]   In order for this battle to be won,
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:32.260]   each person would have to kill 750 men.
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:35.720]   So God places them in a situation
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.860]   where it is not improbable.
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:43.620]   It is impossible all 300 men would have to conquer
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:48.620]   750 other men with swords, the same kinds that they have.
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:52.620]   And God makes it very clear why he is doing that.
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:54.620]   Said at the end of it, when you conquer,
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.860]   you will know I did it.
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:57.880]   That it wasn't you.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:02.460]   Now he does this repeatedly over and over and over
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.060]   in redemptive history.
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:05.380]   Now again, I could have told you,
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:07.340]   I could have taken dozens of examples,
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.380]   and again, I'm not gonna go too deep into it.
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:13.580]   But even the way they conquered Jericho.
[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:16.900]   40 years, all they know how to do is march
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.940]   and take orders and to get in line and stop and set up camp.
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:21.940]   That's what they were trained to do.
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:25.460]   Right before they go in to fight a fortified city,
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:30.020]   trained men who are seasoned in battle,
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.740]   and he says on the seventh day,
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:33.700]   just walk around with this box seven times,
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.220]   tires them out.
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:38.420]   They have a general who has no experience in battle,
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:40.180]   and then instead of sharpening their swords,
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:42.140]   instead of doing basic training,
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:44.580]   all they do is blow a horn.
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.700]   Because he's trying to teach them, it isn't you.
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.780]   It wasn't the training.
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.060]   It wasn't your leadership.
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.540]   It wasn't your organization.
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.420]   It wasn't the sharpness of your sword.
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:56.260]   I did it.
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.740]   And he repeatedly does it over and over
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:00.500]   and over and over again.
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:05.660]   Because the primary sin of mankind is his own arrogance.
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:10.460]   The primary hindrance to our worship,
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:13.340]   to our salvation, is our own arrogance.
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:17.460]   And so God, throughout history, has been humbling us
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:20.260]   so that when he performs miracles,
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.780]   that there would be no doubt
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:26.300]   that this is a miraculous event from God.
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:32.700]   Our natural tendency is whenever we see any kind of fruit,
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.020]   is to study the man.
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:37.420]   To study the system, to study the church,
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:39.420]   to study the mission organization.
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.540]   If we find out that this organization
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:44.620]   was doing well in China, we study the system.
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:46.620]   If we find out that this church was small
[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:47.820]   and then it became a mega church,
[00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.460]   and we've studied the pastor, we've studied the organization,
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.980]   we've studied the program, the discipleship, the teaching.
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:55.540]   And so we study these systems and said,
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.580]   okay, if we do what they did,
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.380]   maybe we can have the same success.
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:00.940]   That's our natural tendency.
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:04.460]   Our natural tendency is that, of course, God did it,
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:05.860]   and it's kind of like a side issue.
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:08.180]   We sprinkle some Jesus on it, we pray in the beginning,
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:09.180]   we pray in the end.
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:11.660]   But the middle part that really requires us,
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:13.260]   we need to get the system right.
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:14.500]   We need to say the right things,
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:16.460]   we need to have the right people.
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:18.460]   Because that is our natural tendency.
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:22.660]   But God, deliberately, throughout history,
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:25.620]   made sure that there's no way humanly possible
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:28.940]   that this could have happened.
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:30.580]   And yet it happened.
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:31.940]   For what purpose?
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:34.580]   So at the end of it, people will take a step back
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.540]   and say, God did it.
[00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:37.380]   God did it.
[00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:42.020]   As impossible as the 300 men of Israelites
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.540]   conquering the Midianites,
[00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:48.300]   what God was calling these 12 men to do
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:53.300]   was far beyond slaughtering 750 other soldiers.
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:57.940]   Because what Jesus was calling them to do
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:00.020]   is, one, that these 12 men,
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:04.300]   these average, untrained men, uneducated men,
[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:07.980]   were going to be giving the commission
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:12.980]   to go convert all the Jews.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.800]   If you remember, Jesus' whole ministry
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:20.800]   never went beyond Galilee and three visits to Jerusalem.
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.300]   Majority of his years of ministry
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.100]   was happened in Galilee, in that area.
[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:30.300]   And at the end of his three years of ministry,
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:31.860]   they all walked away from him.
[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:34.100]   So he was not successful.
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:36.700]   And so the task that was given to the disciples
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.460]   is after he dies, he resurrects,
[00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:41.060]   he's like, you go make disciples of all the nations.
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:44.040]   You saw what I did in Galilee.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.220]   Repeat that, well, if they repeated what Jesus did,
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:48.060]   that they're gonna also get rejected.
[00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:50.380]   I mean, these people who are gonna hate you,
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:52.820]   wanna kill you, after he resurrects,
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:54.060]   he gives them the commission,
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.820]   you go and you preach this gospel.
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:58.480]   And they're gonna hate you like they hated me,
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:59.320]   but you go preach the gospel.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:03.020]   Not only were they given the task to convert Israel
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:06.320]   with this strange gospel that they didn't understand,
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.460]   they were to convert Rome.
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:15.780]   To this day, any empire that is mighty and powerful,
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.280]   they compare it to the Roman Empire.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:21.400]   Because even to this day, they haven't found anything
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.900]   that comes even close.
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.920]   That technically, on paper,
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:26.920]   they lasted over 1,000 years.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:30.040]   And I know that their reign,
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.400]   where everybody just looked up to them,
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.000]   may have lasted about 500 years,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.840]   but they were so influential, so powerful.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:40.300]   But these 12 men were given the task to go
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.800]   preach the gospel to Rome, and convert not only to Rome,
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.700]   but to the remotest part of the world.
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:49.480]   If you knew that that was the task
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.520]   that these disciples were gonna be given,
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:54.040]   would you have chosen Peter?
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:58.560]   Would you have chosen Andrew, or John, or James?
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:01.040]   For sure, Judas Iscariot, we wouldn't have chosen,
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:01.880]   we know that.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:05.040]   But the closer we look at these disciples,
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:08.720]   none of them comes even close to what we would think,
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:12.900]   what the world would think, if we were given that task,
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.380]   if Jesus came to us at that time and said,
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:18.500]   "You know what, instead of me choosing, you choose the 12,"
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:21.180]   would we have chosen any one of these guys?
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:23.860]   We probably would have started with the Sanhedrin,
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:26.140]   maybe the high priest, maybe somebody educated,
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:27.860]   maybe somebody who's powerful.
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:30.780]   Maybe Paul.
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:34.640]   I'm gonna get to him later, right?
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:38.680]   But we wouldn't have chosen any one of these 12 men,
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:41.800]   for sure, they would not have been chosen.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:45.720]   Yet Jesus, in his sovereign will,
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:48.520]   only now, 2,000 years removed, we look back at it,
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:51.200]   and say, "Oh, he was so wise."
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.560]   Only 2,000 years later, knowing that,
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.920]   because we're still here, and the church is still thriving,
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:57.320]   and the word of God is given to us,
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.760]   they've given their lives, and they were successful,
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.320]   and only now, we look back in 2,000 years,
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.000]   and say, "We're so wise now, we're so insightful,
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.780]   "because we have 2,000 years to look at,
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:08.920]   "because of the final success."
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.920]   But if you were at that point, before these 2,000 years,
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.280]   would you have chosen them?
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:17.240]   I'm 100%, you wouldn't have chosen them,
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:18.640]   I wouldn't have chosen them.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.500]   Why does he choose these men?
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:27.260]   Everything about his choosing of these 12 men
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.980]   is the same repetition of what God's been doing
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:31.920]   all throughout history.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:34.200]   He didn't choose the wisest,
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:36.560]   he didn't choose the strongest,
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.240]   he didn't choose the most disciplined,
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.160]   he didn't choose the most educated,
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:43.080]   he chose people that were gonna challenge
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:44.180]   the religious system.
[00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:48.480]   In fact, Acts chapter 4, 13, after Peter preaches,
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.520]   and everybody's so impressed with his boldness,
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:53.980]   they say, "As they observed the confidence of Peter and John
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:56.200]   "and understood that they were uneducated
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.240]   "and untrained men."
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:02.520]   Imagine if you were complimented that way.
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:06.280]   Man, we're so impressed, you are so powerful.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:11.720]   You're not educated, you're not well-trained.
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:13.760]   That's just another way of saying,
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:17.640]   these guys are dumb, they're not like us,
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.080]   they don't have any pedigree.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:23.080]   Why are these guys willing to give their lives
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:23.920]   preaching this?
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.440]   And remember, if you remember Peter's sermon,
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:28.840]   he does such an excellent job
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:32.160]   expositing redemptive history in the Old Testament.
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.320]   And then this David, the prophecy,
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:37.520]   this guy come and Jesus is the fulfillment of that prophecy,
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:40.420]   and then it ends with, "You killed him!"
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:42.800]   People are convicted in their hearts.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.840]   What do we do when people come to repentance?
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.600]   It's like, how are these men able to preach
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:50.040]   such powerful, effective sermons,
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.200]   considering that they were uneducated
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.000]   and unlearned and untrained?
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.300]   And the only credit, only explanation
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.400]   that they were able to give was they were amazed
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:05.320]   and began to recognize them as having been with Jesus.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.160]   That's it.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:10.600]   That's what they recognized, the reason behind their power,
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:11.880]   and these are non-Christians,
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.200]   these are people who are hostile to the faith.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:17.800]   They said, "Oh, it must something about Jesus,
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:22.400]   "something about Jesus made them so powerful."
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:26.640]   Don't miss this, because this is at the core
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:29.320]   of what Jesus has been trying to teach.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:30.540]   It wasn't these men.
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:35.440]   And what came out of the mouth of the people
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:38.200]   who hated Jesus is the very reason
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.720]   why these people were chosen.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:44.280]   He was going to challenge the wisdom of the world
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:45.540]   with the uneducated.
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:51.720]   He was gonna challenge the wisdom and the know-how
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:56.400]   and the experience and their knowledge with nobody's.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:59.880]   And he wanted to make sure that you got that point,
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.220]   that we got that point.
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:04.000]   1 Corinthians 3, 19-91, "For the wisdom of this world
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.460]   "is foolishness before God.
[00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:08.700]   "For it is written, 'He is the one who catches the wise
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:09.960]   "'in their craftiness,'" and again,
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.160]   the Lord knows the reasoning of the wise,
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:14.400]   that they are useless.
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:19.140]   That all the know-how, all the education,
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:22.060]   he said, "In the eyes of God, for the purpose of salvation,"
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:23.480]   is actually useless.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.760]   Not only is it useless, it's harmful.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:31.000]   Because the greatest hindrance to coming to Christ
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.660]   is our own arrogance.
[00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:37.960]   The greatest hindrance to coming to Christ
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.520]   is our own arrogance.
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:42.620]   If you're a little bit stronger than somebody,
[00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:44.360]   if you're a little bit better looking than somebody,
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.680]   if you're a little bit more educated,
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:48.660]   if you have more money, you run a little bit faster,
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:50.200]   you're a little bit more athletic,
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:52.880]   it doesn't take much for us to be filled with pride.
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:55.640]   But as soon as pride enters, it ruins,
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.240]   any gift that God has given you.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:04.200]   2 Corinthians 12, nine, "And he said to me,
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.460]   "Paul, my grace is sufficient for you,
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:10.420]   "for power is perfected in weakness."
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:14.480]   Think about the task that we have been given.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:17.700]   He said, "Our fight is not against flesh and blood,
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:19.580]   "but against principalities and power,
[00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:22.100]   "and demonic forces."
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:25.160]   And this is clear.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:29.640]   I'm almost sure almost 99% of you
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:31.720]   have already heard and exposited,
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:34.520]   and maybe even memorized that text.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:39.520]   And yet, we keep throwing flesh at the spiritual battle.
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:43.160]   We keep throwing, if we're organized enough,
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:46.600]   if we read enough, if we have the right people,
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:50.120]   if we have the right training, we can conquer Satan.
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:54.340]   The arrogance of that, Paul reminds them,
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:56.700]   we're not fighting a physical battle.
[00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:58.880]   It is spiritual.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:01.780]   You must cling to Christ.
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:07.700]   Paul comes and begs to have the storm taken away,
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:10.020]   and Jesus responds to him, "My grace is sufficient for you,
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.980]   "my power is perfected in weakness."
[00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:16.280]   In other words, it's your power that's getting in the way.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:20.940]   It's my power that's gonna help conquer.
[00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:23.180]   I will build my church, and the gates of Hades
[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:26.180]   will not prevail against it, not your church.
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:28.380]   So it is when you are weak, when you get out of the way,
[00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:29.940]   when you stop touching the glory,
[00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:34.100]   when you stop taking the credit, my power is demonstrated.
[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:38.100]   My power is perfected in weakness, most godly,
[00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:40.700]   therefore I will rather boast about my weakness
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:43.780]   so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:47.140]   He's not boasting, he's like, "Oh, I'm so weak, I'm so weak."
[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:49.980]   Sometimes even the way that we're humble
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.700]   is bragging about our humility.
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:56.100]   And he says, "No, because I really want the power of God,
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:56:00.200]   "and power of God is demonstrated when I am weak,
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:04.680]   "so if I want the power of God, I tell you my weakness,
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:08.020]   "knowing that despite my weakness,
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:12.020]   "in fact, sometimes because of my weakness,
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:13.780]   "his power is shown."
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:19.500]   Imagine how much time, effort, money
[00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:21.540]   is devoted to becoming something
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:26.580]   when God's call clearly is to become nothing.
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:30.820]   Imagine how much time and energy,
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:35.860]   imagine how much of our depression and anxiety
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:41.820]   comes from disappointment that we feel like we're nothing.
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:48.780]   Because we're striving against what God has called us.
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:54.820]   Imagine the foolishness of knowing, reading, memorizing,
[00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:57.700]   even singing about this, and yet every other part
[00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:59.860]   of our life is we're trying to become something,
[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:03.620]   even as we serve God, we wanna become something
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.660]   when God has called us to become nothing.
[00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:10.000]   As it is in our weakness where he is strong.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.700]   We try so hard to get noticed when God is trying so hard
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:17.680]   to hide us so that they don't remember your name,
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:21.800]   that you don't have all the best reputation,
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.280]   that people don't, like, wow, you're so good at that.
[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:28.060]   He's trying so hard to prevent us from getting praise.
[00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:34.100]   Because as soon as praise come to us, we're ruined.
[00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:40.960]   We try so hard to live while the central calling
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:42.440]   of the gospel is to die.
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:46.620]   We try so hard to make a better living
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:48.420]   so that our children will have a better living,
[00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:50.980]   so that we can have a generational,
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:53.780]   as he says, he who seeks his life will lose it,
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:56.340]   he who loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
[00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:59.180]   It's that the central calling of the gospel is to die,
[00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:01.520]   become nothing, be hidden in Christ.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:07.020]   So that if God exhausts us for any reason,
[00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:09.260]   that people will say, what's wrong with this uneducated,
[00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:13.240]   dumb, untrained man who doesn't know anything?
[00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:15.160]   Why is he bearing so much root?
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:18.220]   Oh, it's Jesus.
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:22.940]   Not him, not his smart, not his talent, it's Jesus.
[00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:29.840]   These men wrote the Bible, and a lot of people say,
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:32.080]   well, they wrote the Bible, they did all the stuff
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:34.360]   so that they can benefit from this great man,
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:35.980]   and so that's why.
[00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:38.580]   They made up this stuff so that they can be honored.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:42.040]   That's come from somebody who's never read the Bible.
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:46.720]   If you read the Bible, I mean, we know that they were
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:49.360]   uneducated, untrained men, but I mean,
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:51.620]   man, they were really dumb.
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:54.980]   Because after you carefully examine their life,
[00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:58.840]   you come out thinking, these men changed the world?
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:02.720]   This backstabber was part of the 12?
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:07.500]   And at Jesus' greatest need, he abandons him,
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:09.660]   even as Jesus is going to the cross,
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:11.420]   they're like fighting each other to see
[00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:12.760]   who's going to be great.
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:13.700]   These men?
[00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:18.820]   So if these guys lied, man, they're like,
[00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:21.220]   something's off with them, right?
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:23.980]   They don't come out good.
[00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:26.980]   Even at the resurrection, they couldn't believe.
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:28.680]   These women come, it's like, well, we've seen him.
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.880]   It's like, yeah, right.
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:32.700]   Jesus made it very clear that was gonna happen.
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:34.580]   He's like, nah, that couldn't happen.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:37.580]   Yeah, these guys wrote that about themselves?
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:45.700]   The 12 men, the choosing of them,
[00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:50.220]   has something so profound, collectively and individually,
[00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:55.220]   to teach us, fundamentally, because we resist and fight.
[00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:59.980]   So that's why even a doctrine of predestination,
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:01.180]   it bothers people.
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:05.740]   It bothers the core of our pride.
[01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:09.860]   God is in sovereign control, he's completely in control.
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:11.700]   What about man's dignity?
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:14.180]   I need to choose, I have to have power.
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.020]   Yeah, that's what the scripture says.
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:19.020]   At the core of who we are, we're fighting,
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:21.500]   because we need to have some sort of a dignity.
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:22.740]   We're not controlled like robots,
[01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:24.780]   that we don't fully understand,
[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:26.580]   but we know what the Bible says.
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:31.600]   It is very, very, very difficult.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.880]   To kill our pride, because our lens,
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:40.040]   through which we see, is self-centered.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.040]   From the moment we are born.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.720]   From infancy, we are born.
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.440]   That infant doesn't care if you're tired,
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.840]   or a mother gave birth and took 25 hours,
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:55.040]   and she's about to pass out.
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.520]   That infant doesn't care.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.680]   I'm hungry, and you need to give me food.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:00:59.880]   And I'm gonna scream my head off,
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:02.080]   until you satisfy me.
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.240]   And you think, well, I mean, we've grown out of that, right?
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.720]   We've grown out of that.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.320]   We don't do that anymore, right?
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:14.240]   No, we just become more sophisticated.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.920]   We've become more sophisticated,
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:20.240]   because we start crying and throwing tantrum.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:22.280]   People are gonna judge us, and they're not gonna like us,
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.560]   and then we're not gonna get what we want.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:27.160]   So we just found different methods to get what we want.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:30.440]   We just found different ways to express ourselves.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.800]   But how much of our crying out is crying out for me?
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:38.800]   For my comfort, for attention on me,
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:41.120]   for somebody who recognize me,
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:45.520]   that somebody recognize my hurt, my pain, my sorrow, me!
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:52.200]   Not realizing it is our own pride,
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.560]   our own self-centeredness.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.960]   It's what's killing us.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.280]   He who finds his life will lose it.
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:05.280]   He who loses his life will find it.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.400]   Even in the context of serving God,
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.800]   we figure out a method, we figure out a training,
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.360]   we figure out that if we find just good men,
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.760]   if we just find a good method,
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:16.880]   if we read the right books,
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.800]   if we go and have the right leaders,
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.360]   if we can just find the right system,
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.640]   we can do what God calls us to.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.800]   Are you kidding?
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:26.800]   You're going to convert the spiritual world
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.880]   led by Satan and his angels
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.040]   by finding a system that will work?
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:31.880]   Are you kidding?
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:36.320]   Only way that we can engage in the spiritual battle
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.880]   is His power is demonstrated.
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.840]   His power, His glory.
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.720]   And the only way that His glory and His power
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.520]   is demonstrated when we become weak
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:48.560]   and we get out of the way and we die to ourselves.
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.560]   That's the backbone behind what God has been doing
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.600]   through history and the choosing of these 12 men
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.000]   are no different.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.120]   He chooses these 12 men
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.920]   so that these men will not get the glory.
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:09.240]   Because when men receive glory, we die.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:12.560]   When God receives glory, we live.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:15.160]   It's simple as that.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:18.840]   That's why the first vision of our church
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.840]   is God-centered worship.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.880]   God-centered worship means
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.400]   that we're not first calculating what do you like,
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.720]   what makes you happy,
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.160]   what's going to bring the most people,
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.640]   what causes you to be most encouraged.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.600]   That's not our primary concern.
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:36.720]   Our primary concern is what brings God the most glory,
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.040]   how does He want to be worshiped,
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.120]   what prescription has He given?
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.960]   And make sure that all that we do,
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.800]   not just worship or singing or fellowship or discipleship,
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:48.480]   all of it is God-centered, not man-centered.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:53.480]   Now all of this is an introduction to Peter.
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:56.080]   And now you can see why I didn't finish for service.
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:59.760]   I have five points, but I'm only gonna give you
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:00.960]   three today, okay?
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.160]   And then I'm gonna get to the other next week.
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:06.920]   Peter was clearly the leader.
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.880]   He was the leader because he's always
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.680]   on the top of the list, right?
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:14.040]   So Peter, Andrew, James, and John,
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:16.120]   those guys are always on the top of the list
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.760]   because they were the four first disciples
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.280]   that Jesus picks up.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.280]   The second group of people, Philip, Bartholomew,
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:24.400]   Matthew, and Thomas, we know some things about them,
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.880]   but they're not at the center.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.120]   But they're mentioned quite a bit,
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.960]   enough so that we have enough information.
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.680]   The third group starts with James, son of Alphaeus,
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:35.280]   Simon, the zealot, Judas, the son of James,
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.760]   and Judas Iscariot.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:39.000]   So we know Judas Iscariot, and we're gonna take some time
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.960]   to dig into why was that man even chosen?
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:45.800]   'Cause clearly Jesus was not surprised of his betrayals.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.640]   I'm not gonna get into that today.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:51.360]   But the first four were brothers, right?
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.680]   They were at the core of Jesus's ministry.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:57.280]   And Peter was at the top.
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.760]   In fact, out of the four,
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.120]   three of them become the inner circle.
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:04.280]   They're the ones who are taken up to the transfiguration
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:06.760]   and shown the glory, and then they were commissioned
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:07.800]   to go and tell other people
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:09.400]   after the resurrection of Christ.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:14.320]   I don't know what happened to Andrew.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.880]   'Cause Andrew's the one who introduced
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:17.160]   all of them to Jesus.
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:19.760]   Andrew's the one who said, "Hey, come see this man."
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:22.800]   And then he introduces everybody,
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.200]   and then Jesus says, "Peter, James, and John,
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.040]   "you come with me.
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:28.040]   "Andrew, sit back."
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:28.880]   Right?
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:31.880]   So I have no idea why Andrew disappeared.
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:34.080]   And I told you before, he's a mystery to me.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.800]   When I get to heaven, I'm gonna ask him.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.680]   If I get to ask him, "Andrew, how did you feel?"
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:43.840]   (congregation laughing)
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:47.200]   When your brother and James and John
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.640]   came back from that mountain,
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.840]   and you asked them, "What happened up there?"
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:52.680]   And they said, "I can't tell you."
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:55.320]   (congregation laughing)
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.480]   And then he's like, "What?"
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.200]   I mean, first of all, I didn't get taken up there.
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:02.560]   And then now you're not even gonna tell me?
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:05.480]   And then after the resurrection,
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:08.120]   Jesus, Peter mentions about the transfiguration,
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:10.720]   we heard the voice of God.
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.480]   We saw the glory of the Son.
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:16.040]   Can you imagine Andrew hearing this like, "What?"
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:19.440]   Not only was I not taken up there,
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.120]   and you didn't even tell me,
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:24.360]   you heard the audible voice of God,
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:27.640]   and I wasn't taken up, I'm the one who introduced you.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:31.000]   I have no idea what happened, right?
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:31.920]   When I get to heaven, I'm gonna ask,
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.880]   "Andrew, what happened?
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:34.640]   "What did you do?"
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.000]   Right?
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.520]   I don't know, there's some wisdom behind that.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.440]   We're gonna try to dig into that a little bit further
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:40.960]   when we get to Andrew.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.360]   But Peter, one, first point, clearly is the leader.
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.240]   Right?
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:49.040]   He's a leader because he's always written first,
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.880]   and he says he's the first among the disciples,
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:52.720]   so clearly he's a leader.
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.760]   But he's a leader.
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.640]   He's clearly a leader,
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:00.400]   but before we even get to that point,
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.600]   he was a changed man, right?
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.680]   He was a changed man.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:06.520]   He didn't just choose anybody
[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:07.800]   and then just kind of left them alone.
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:10.160]   As soon as he gets chosen,
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:15.320]   at some point, Jesus changes his name from Simon to Peter,
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.960]   and we see that pattern all throughout scripture.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:21.400]   Abram, his name means honored father,
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.000]   changes his name to Abraham,
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.640]   which means father of multitudes,
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.160]   before he has one child.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:29.040]   Imagine him walking around,
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.640]   and people ask you, "What's your name?"
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:32.560]   Abraham.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:33.600]   Well, Abraham,
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:37.120]   as father of multitudes,
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.280]   and he doesn't have a child.
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.120]   It's like, okay,
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.480]   something weird's going on.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.920]   What's your wife's name?
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:47.200]   Well, it used to be Sarai, which means princess,
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:51.600]   but Yahweh told us to change our name to Sarah,
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.360]   which means mother of nations,
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.520]   before she has a child.
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.120]   And obviously, this was a foreshadowing
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.400]   of what God was intending to do with them.
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.720]   We see that with Jacob.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:05.080]   His name means slippery one or supplanter.
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.440]   The one who holds the heels of his brother.
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:09.280]   That was his name.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.600]   He's a tricky one.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.640]   That's not a good name to have, right?
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.640]   So, are there any Jacobs in here?
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:18.640]   'Cause the Jacob basically means, like,
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.560]   don't trust this guy, right?
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.480]   He's a slippery one.
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:25.520]   Yeah, I know, there must be a Jacob in here somewhere.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:26.680]   But that's what the name means.
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.280]   He was a slippery one, supplanter.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.600]   He's the one who challenges,
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.640]   and he kind of like tricks his brother
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.160]   to get into this higher position,
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.440]   and then at the end of his life,
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.080]   God changes his name to Israel,
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:38.880]   which means the one who wrestles with God,
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.680]   contends with God,
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:44.040]   and God's whole nation
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:47.280]   is given that name, Israel,
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.560]   because he becomes the founder of that,
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:50.760]   and basically means he's a wrestler.
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:54.720]   So, he saw a guy who was tricky, slippery, conniving,
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.800]   and turned him into the one who wrestles
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.960]   and contends with God.
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:00.960]   But you know what's interesting?
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:04.280]   Apostle Paul, we universally accept that he's an apostle,
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:06.160]   but apostle Paul's the only one
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:08.360]   where he has a great name,
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:11.800]   and he gives him a name that probably you wouldn't want.
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:16.680]   His name, Saul, means the one prayed for, right?
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.560]   One prayed for, that's what Saul means.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:19.880]   Like, he has his,
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.560]   so that's interesting,
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.760]   that God was going to humble this man.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.160]   Remember when he is,
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.920]   he's the one who preached to the thousands,
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.280]   risking his life.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:32.520]   He was the one who raised Dorcas from death.
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:36.000]   He was the one who writes 1 and 2 Peter.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.880]   He was a man of action.
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:38.840]   He was the guy who was like,
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.520]   yes, if he was convicted, he didn't just sit on it.
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:45.280]   You know, I had somebody,
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:47.600]   a younger pastor from years ago,
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.560]   who wanted to be a leader,
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.960]   but he says he doesn't like being first.
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:54.320]   And I said, what does that mean?
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.400]   He said, like, yeah, you know,
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:56.560]   like if there's something,
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.760]   'cause I'm not a risk taker,
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.160]   and so I want to see what other people do,
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:02.880]   and then I go in after that,
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.520]   and I figure out how to do it better, right?
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:08.640]   I said, Dan, you're not a leader.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.240]   Whoever jumps into that pool first
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:11.680]   to figure out if you're going to live or die,
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:13.160]   that's the leader, right?
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.480]   'Cause that's the guy that everybody's going to follow,
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:16.520]   right?
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.320]   You can't be a leader with,
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.480]   let's say if you die, right?
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.320]   And then if you don't die, I'll come after you.
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.440]   Then you're not the leader.
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.640]   I don't care what kind of title that you have.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.160]   I don't know what kind of training you have.
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:30.040]   The leader's the guy who's up in the front,
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:30.880]   risking his neck.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:32.280]   That's Peter.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:35.400]   Peter's the guy who jumps in the lake, right?
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:36.920]   He's the guy who makes the confession.
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:39.360]   He's the guy who, even though he fails,
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:43.480]   clearly Peter is the leader by his personality,
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:44.760]   by his, he acts.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:46.880]   If he's convicted, he's the guy who acts.
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:53.160]   Peter, and this is my final point for today,
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:58.680]   Peter is both carnal and spiritual, right?
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:03.680]   Depending on which passage and what event you're looking at,
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.240]   Peter, you're like, "This guy's the leader?"
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:08.280]   And then there are other passages like,
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.800]   "Oh, he's the leader."
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:17.920]   In fact, and this is MacArthur,
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.120]   John MacArthur's point of view about Peter
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:22.960]   that only applies to Jesus.
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.640]   And I don't know if this is accurate or not,
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:27.880]   but this is his view that oftentimes Peter,
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:30.760]   when Jesus calls him Simon,
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.280]   is because Peter's doing something wrong.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.040]   And then when he says Peter,
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.960]   it's because he's commending him.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.320]   And so Jesus, the way he calls and goes back and forth,
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.360]   and he has a list of things to prove.
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:44.680]   And that's not the way his name generally is used.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.880]   He goes back and forth to Simon, Peter, Simon, Peter.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.880]   Sometimes it would be Simon, sometimes it's Peter,
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.600]   sometimes it's Simon, Peter, right?
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.560]   Whether that's true or not, we see it.
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.960]   We see it in his life.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.480]   He's the one who sees Jesus and he's like,
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.320]   "Is that you?
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.160]   "Can I come?"
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.640]   And he goes out into the water and he's going out.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.560]   And then the storm comes and he begins to sink
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:09.280]   and then Jesus rebukes him, right?
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.120]   And you really look at that and it's like,
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.640]   "Ah, this weak faith man.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:15.080]   "Like how long am I gonna be with you?"
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:19.240]   But he was the one out in the water, right?
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:20.720]   The other R11 was in the boat.
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.920]   He's like, "Let's see if he sinks."
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:23.760]   You know, and he begins to say,
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:26.440]   "I knew it, that guy, man, he's so impulsive.
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.160]   "He should have stayed in with us."
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.200]   But he's the guy who's out in the water taking the risk.
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:33.600]   So when he goes out, he looks brave.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.720]   When he begins to sink, he's like,
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.960]   "Ah, he's like this guy again."
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:40.760]   He's the guy who makes the confession.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:45.760]   "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:48.040]   Flesh has not revealed this to you.
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.520]   This was given to you by God.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:51.120]   And upon this confession, Peter,
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.000]   I will build my church and the gates of Hades
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.320]   will not prevail against it.
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.800]   And you can imagine Peter walking around.
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:57.640]   You hear that?
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.120]   Andrew, did you hear that?
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.920]   Upon my confession.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:07.160]   And literally in the very next passage,
[01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:08.720]   everybody will fail, I won't fail.
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:12.780]   Jesus says, "No, you're gonna fail me miserably, right?
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:14.280]   "And you're gonna deny me three times."
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:16.740]   And then very next passage, Jesus says,
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:18.800]   "Get behind me, Satan."
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:21.560]   Can you imagine the confusion?
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:22.400]   Jesus, which is it?
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.920]   Am I Satan or am I the foundation of the church?
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:25.760]   Which is it?
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:30.280]   'Cause he heard that back to back.
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:33.200]   He's the one who confesses.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:36.080]   Like, "I'm not going to deny you.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.240]   "I will die for you."
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:39.580]   And I think Peter meant it.
[01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:40.420]   I think he meant it.
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:41.680]   I don't think he was just talking
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:42.660]   'cause he was a man of action.
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:44.580]   In fact, when the soldiers came,
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:46.720]   they were probably outnumbered by hundreds.
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:49.440]   They came early in the morning
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.240]   because they were afraid of the crowd.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:52.760]   So they didn't come with two, three people.
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.980]   They didn't come with a dozen.
[01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:57.120]   They came with hundreds of people.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.840]   And Peter took out his knife, swung it.
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:02.120]   Clearly, he was a fisherman, not a swordsman.
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:05.080]   So he doesn't hit the guy, he cuts off his ear.
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.780]   It's a very comical scene.
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:09.840]   Jesus picks the ear back up and puts it back on.
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.200]   Peter, what are you doing?
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:12.440]   (congregation laughing)
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.360]   He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword.
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:17.640]   And so Peter's like, "I don't understand what's going on."
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:20.600]   Peter's the one who follows them.
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:23.160]   Everybody else scatters and they're hiding in fear.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.880]   Peter's the one that's like, "What's going on?"
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:27.180]   So the reason why he ends up denying him
[01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:29.600]   is because he went with Jesus
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.400]   instead of hiding like the others.
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.440]   So when he went with Jesus,
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:36.400]   at least he had the courage to go because he was loyal.
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.080]   But because of that, he ended up denying.
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.200]   In fact, the scripture says
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.260]   that he began to curse on his third time.
[01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:46.280]   "I told you I don't know this man."
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:50.240]   Depending on where you see him,
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:55.320]   either he's fleshly or he's spiritual.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.200]   In fact, I think one of the passages
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:59.780]   that really reveals his personality
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:01.820]   is in John 13, six through 10,
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:03.860]   when Jesus is washing the feet of the disciples
[01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:06.920]   and Peter, out of loyalty and his love for his master,
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.120]   says this.
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:09.240]   So he came to Simon Peter.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:12.480]   He said to him, "Lord, do you wash my feet?"
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.920]   Jesus answered and said to him,
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.080]   "What I do, you do not realize now,
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.820]   "but you will understand hereafter."
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:20.140]   Peter said to him, "Never shall you wash my feet."
[01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:22.000]   Jesus answered him, "If I do not wash you,
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.240]   "you have no part with me."
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:26.340]   Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, then wash not only my feet,
[01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:29.700]   "but also my hands and my head."
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:31.200]   Jesus answered him, "He who has bathed
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.240]   "needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean,
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:36.840]   "and you are clean, but not all of you."
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:39.660]   You know what that's like?
[01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:42.320]   It's like he's at the table
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:45.440]   and his master chooses to sit at the end of the table
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.400]   where it's not honored.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:49.260]   And Peter said, "No, no, master, you're my master.
[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:50.540]   "You should be at the head of the table."
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:53.240]   Remember, this is an Asian culture, right?
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:55.560]   You can't, you can't eat comfortably
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.860]   if the guy who's supposed to be at the front
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:59.740]   is sitting at the end and he's not being honored.
[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:00.860]   So this is an Asian culture,
[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:02.860]   so you're not gonna be able to digest your food
[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:04.820]   in this culture if he sits there.
[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:06.580]   They said, "Master, you can't sit there."
[01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:09.640]   And Jesus answers, "I must sit here.
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.180]   "You don't understand this now,
[01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:12.260]   "but if you don't let me sit here,
[01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:13.580]   "I have no relationship with you."
[01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:16.080]   And then Peter responds, "Then get on the floor."
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:19.260]   (congregation laughing)
[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:22.900]   That's basically what he's saying, right?
[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:24.140]   "You can't wash my feet."
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:25.460]   He's like, "Well, I have no relationship with you."
[01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:27.820]   "Then wash everything, right?
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:29.020]   "Then bathe me."
[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:34.020]   That's so Peter, that's his personality.
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.020]   He's just all passion.
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:38.020]   He talks and he moves.
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:40.460]   And then he makes mistakes and then he gets rebuked.
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:44.600]   Now why is this so relevant to us?
[01:16:45.460 --> 01:16:47.380]   Because this man looks just like us.
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:51.820]   He looks just like us,
[01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:53.620]   'cause we have a tendency to look at Peter and say,
[01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:55.300]   "Well, he's a man of faith and he did this
[01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:56.840]   "and he's willing to die for Christ.
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.140]   "He was crucified upside down."
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:04.140]   And sometimes I don't like reading biographies
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:07.660]   that kind of highlight all the good stuff about the man
[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:09.580]   and never share his struggle.
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:12.520]   Sometimes I read books and this guy woke up
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:15.060]   at three in the morning and he fasted and prayed
[01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:17.100]   every day, right?
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:19.700]   Then he evangelized, planted 50 churches,
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.660]   and he memorized the whole scripture
[01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:23.460]   from Genesis to Revelation.
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:25.940]   And so we need to honor this man
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:27.180]   because he's done such great work.
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:28.420]   He's a man of God.
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:29.340]   And you read that thinking,
[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:31.580]   like, "When did this guy sleep?
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:32.820]   "When did he eat?
[01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:35.240]   "How did he memorize all of that scripture
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:37.260]   "and then fasted every other day?"
[01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:42.380]   But real testimonies of people that I know
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:45.260]   are people in the context of struggling,
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:48.940]   wrestling, and failing.
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:52.700]   Most people that I know struggle with their flesh
[01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:54.460]   and are fighting.
[01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:55.840]   I can't give in to this.
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:00.540]   Somebody cuts me off, I get angry like everybody else
[01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:02.540]   and say, "I can't do this, I'm a pastor."
[01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:08.340]   But my flesh and my desire to honor God
[01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:11.180]   is fighting within me and I'm trying to fight
[01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:13.740]   and struggle with this and that's the real reality.
[01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:16.420]   And we look at Peter and the disciples,
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:18.260]   they look just like us.
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:21.560]   They look just like us.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:25.820]   Depending on what day you examine him,
[01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:28.560]   just like us on Sunday, all of you are beautiful.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:34.420]   You put on your godly faces, you sing your songs,
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:36.420]   you go outside, nobody's yelling at each other
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:38.900]   even though you're irritated inside.
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:42.660]   And you hold that in until you get into your car, right?
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:45.300]   Because that's a flesh safe zone.
[01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:50.900]   You're the godliest person here and then you get in the car
[01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:53.700]   and your kids are irritating, they're not listening to you
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:55.400]   or somebody said something insensitive
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:58.860]   and then shut the door, get out the car,
[01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:01.160]   get on the freeway, make sure nobody's around.
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:04.380]   Can you believe what they did?
[01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:08.360]   It sounds, this guy sounds just like us.
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.360]   Struggling.
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:14.160]   Depending on if you saw him on Sunday or Monday
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:17.720]   or Friday or Wednesday at Bible study, right?
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:20.600]   That's not by accident.
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:23.840]   'Cause this wasn't about Peter.
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:28.720]   Us studying Peter and the other disciples
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:32.880]   ultimately is not to figure out what qualities
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:36.600]   that we're supposed to mimic so that we can change the world
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:37.840]   for Jesus Christ.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:43.160]   If we're honest with ourselves, we study them,
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:45.600]   these guys were chosen.
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:51.120]   In fact, in Galatians 2, if you guys know Galatians
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.440]   and just give you a heads up, we're studying Galatians
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.000]   for our next teaching and give you a little plug.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.520]   Galatians is one of the most interesting books.
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:01.880]   If you read it superficially, you get very little out of it
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.440]   or you'll get a lot out of it still
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:05.920]   but Galatians is meant to be dug in.
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:09.600]   'Cause so much theology comes from the book of Galatians.
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:12.920]   I would say outside of Romans and Hebrews,
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:17.000]   Galatians is the next letter that is rich in theology.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.840]   That was the primary struggle for the first 150 years
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:22.680]   of the church.
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:25.760]   And so Paul comes out and he says,
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:28.120]   "If anyone preaches a gospel other than what I have preached
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:29.360]   "to you, let him be anathema."
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.860]   This is Galatians chapter one.
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:35.320]   So even if me or an angel of God comes and preaches
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.760]   to a different God, let him be anathema.
[01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:41.760]   And then he says, "If I succumb to pressure of man,
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:44.800]   "I'm not serving God, I'm serving man."
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:47.000]   You know why he says all of that?
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.120]   Because chapter two's coming.
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:52.400]   All of chapter one is a setup for what he needs to say
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:53.400]   in chapter two.
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.600]   And so because in chapter two, after he said all that
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.240]   and he puts all of that out, he says in Galatians 2.11,
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:01.840]   "But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.580]   "because he stood condemned.
[01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:07.020]   "For prior to the coming of certain men from James,
[01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:09.420]   "he used to eat with the Gentiles.
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.280]   "But when they came, he began to withdraw
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:13.440]   "and hold himself aloof, fearing the party
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:15.480]   "of the circumcision.
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.980]   "The rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy
[01:21:17.980 --> 01:21:20.900]   "with the result that even Barnabas was carried away
[01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:23.120]   "by their hypocrisy."
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:26.320]   Now I want you to think, this is an Asian culture, right?
[01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:30.480]   And Peter is the head of the apostles.
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:33.560]   And Paul, this latecomer, and the only reason
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.840]   why they even accepted him is 'cause Barnabas
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:38.840]   stood in the gap and said, "No, trust me,
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:40.320]   "his conversion was real."
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:44.420]   This guy who killed Stephen, he got permission
[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:48.680]   from Ananias and Caiaphas to go grab more Christians
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:49.720]   and kill them.
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:54.720]   That guy publicly shames Peter to his face.
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:57.800]   This was not a prior conversation.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:02.040]   I don't wanna disturb you, I don't want other people
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:04.640]   to think badly of you, I respect you.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:07.200]   So he goes to him in private and points out,
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.560]   he said, "No, it's public."
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:10.800]   Publicly shames him.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.960]   Not only shames him, shames Barnabas who was so loyal
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:15.460]   to him and stood for him.
[01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:20.280]   But he says, "Their hypocrisy's gonna ruin the gospel
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.240]   "for the sake of the kingdom."
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.240]   So chapter one is a setup for what he's about to do
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:26.000]   because he understands if people don't receive this well,
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.920]   it's gonna ruin the church.
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:30.400]   You have this Apostle Paul who's going around planting
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:33.280]   all these churches and a huge name among the Gentiles
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:38.280]   and the pillars, pillars in the early church,
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:42.720]   Peter and Barnabas was gonna be publicly shamed.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:48.240]   So he needed to set the foundation, we're not about Peter.
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:51.300]   We're not about me, we're not even about angels.
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.860]   We're about Christ and Christ crucified.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.680]   Now, if Peter got offended and he came out swinging,
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:02.000]   it's like, it's not about what he said,
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   it's about how he said it and then started going at it
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.680]   with Paul, that would have splintered the church
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:09.480]   and I don't know if it would have been humanly speaking.
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:13.000]   But we see later on in Peter's writing,
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.080]   2 Peter 3, 14 and 16 says this.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:18.200]   And let me start reading from verse 15.
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:20.080]   And regard the patience of our Lord as salvation
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:22.200]   just as also our beloved brother Paul,
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:25.440]   according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:28.960]   as also in all his letters, speaking in them
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:32.880]   of these things in which are some things hard to understand
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:35.200]   which the untaught and unstable distort
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.560]   as they do also the rest of scripture
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:39.200]   to their own destruction.
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.760]   So you see what he does there?
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:43.820]   He equates Paul's writings with other scripture.
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:48.420]   Paul recognizes, I'm sure he's a human being.
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:50.520]   He was offended, he was hurt.
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:52.920]   You shame me in front of other people.
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.760]   And he said, but the reason why he doesn't lash out
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:58.800]   is 'cause Peter understood that this was from the Lord.
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:01.880]   And he humbled himself.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:03.080]   And you know when he says other people,
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:04.680]   because it's hard to understand, they distort.
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:06.080]   You know why he says that?
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:07.120]   Because that was him.
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:09.520]   That was him.
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:11.280]   He couldn't understand.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.760]   He couldn't understand, like, well, what are you doing?
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:14.040]   Why was this necessary?
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.560]   And he said, but it was from the Lord.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:17.800]   So he submitted himself.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.020]   Can you imagine if Peter and Barnabas,
[01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:26.600]   they split, what would happen to the early church?
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:27.440]   This is Peter.
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:32.220]   Sometimes a weak man, sometimes a strong man.
[01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:35.400]   Sometimes fleshy, sometimes loyal.
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:38.400]   Sometimes denying Christ, sometimes loving Christ.
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:41.100]   Isn't that you?
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:45.080]   Isn't that me?
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:45.920]   That's all of us.
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:49.520]   Whenever we put man on pedestal,
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:52.520]   it's just a matter of time
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:56.320]   that you will work hard to knock him off.
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:59.840]   Don't ever put a man on a pedestal.
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:03.080]   No man belongs on a pedestal, no man.
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.360]   That doesn't mean you don't honor him.
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:07.200]   It doesn't mean you don't follow him.
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:11.240]   But he's never to be meant to be on a pedestal.
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.600]   Let me conclude with this.
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.680]   If you knew three years from now
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:20.920]   that your closest friends today
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:24.240]   are going to disappear
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:27.320]   in the most difficult part of your life
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.160]   three years from now,
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:31.120]   you're gonna be accused of something horrendous
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:32.040]   that is not true.
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:36.400]   And people, false witnesses are gonna come and accuse you,
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.240]   and then they're going to indict you,
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:40.760]   and then they're going to put you in jail,
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:43.040]   and then eventually they're going to kill you.
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.720]   Execution.
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:47.320]   And all your friends,
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:49.680]   your best friends that you have today
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:52.320]   that you know are gonna abandon you at that time.
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:56.520]   How would that affect your relationship today?
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:59.640]   Would you still be friends with them?
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:03.080]   Would you be excited to celebrate their birthdays
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.720]   when their birthday comes around?
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:10.520]   Would you begin to weed those people out of your life?
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:16.960]   Probably, if we knew that the closest friends
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:19.080]   that we have today are gonna abandon us
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.840]   at the most difficult time of our life three years from now,
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:24.760]   and when I'm being executed, nobody's there,
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:28.800]   most likely it will affect your relationship today.
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:35.400]   Yet Christ, knowing all that these disciples would do,
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:38.400]   chose to love them,
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:41.960]   walk with them, live with them,
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:45.160]   fed them, protected them,
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:47.760]   and then eventually died for them.
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:53.680]   The study of these 12 men isn't about Peter.
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:55.560]   It's not about John or Andrew.
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:58.120]   It's about Christ.
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:02.080]   It's about the foundation of his church.
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:07.320]   And the same love that he loved as disciples loved us,
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:11.160]   and has called us to love as he loved.
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:15.480]   To choose to love people that we don't want to love,
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:18.960]   to bring the greatest glory to God.
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:21.680]   Let's pray.
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:33.520]   Heavenly Father, we come before you
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:37.240]   knowing full well our own weakness,
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:39.760]   how we are prone to want
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:42.360]   how we are prone to wander, even now.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:47.000]   Some of us have hardened our hearts
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.800]   because we do not want to follow the path
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.440]   that you have laid before us.
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:56.600]   I pray, Father God, that you would be merciful,
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:59.200]   that you would hear our prayers.
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:02.160]   Help us, Lord God, to see the value of the glory
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:03.480]   of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:07.000]   that we would volunteer and desire to be hidden.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:13.440]   Help us, Lord God, to die in Christ
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:15.200]   that we may truly live in Christ.
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:20.640]   May Christ and Christ alone be exalted in us and through us.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:23.200]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:24.800]   Let's all stand up and praise.
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:37.880]   You are mine.
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:29:05.520]   One more time, you are.
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:07.920]   (soft music)
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.960]   You are my strength when I am weak.
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:14.400]   You are the treasure that I seek.
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.400]   You are my all in all.
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:24.840]   Seeking you as a precious jewel,
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:28.280]   hope to give up I'd be a fool.
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:30.120]   You are my all in all.
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:34.400]   Jesus, Lamb of God.

[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:44.000]   that you have implanted in our minds and our hearts
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.840]   would transform and renew us.
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:48.560]   Lord, search us and know us
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:51.400]   and see if there's any hurtful ways in us.
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:54.400]   Any patterns that we have allowed in our lives, Lord God,
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:57.320]   that continue to harden our hearts.
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.560]   Excusing sins, Lord God,
[01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:02.180]   because we don't see the immediate consequence.
[01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:07.960]   Continuing to drift, Father, not fighting and striving,
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:10.020]   not searching you with all our hearts.
[01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:15.000]   Help us, Lord God, as we recognize our weakness,
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.040]   that there will be a growing hungering and thirsting
