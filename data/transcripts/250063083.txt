[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.960]   All right, let's take our Bibles and turn to Exodus chapter 7.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.840]   Okay, Exodus chapter 7, verses 1.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.520]   And as we turn there, I'd like to introduce today's sermon by thinking about things that
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.160]   we like to do versus things that we should do.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.280]   Okay, things that we like to do versus things that we should do.
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.480]   During our typically around the new year, we make a lot of resolutions and one of the
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.080]   things that we resolve to do is really take care of our health, right?
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.720]   So let's say for example, like eating, there are things we like to eat and then there are
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.600]   things we should eat, okay?
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.560]   Truthfully, I really do for some odd reason, like everybody does, but really love the stuff
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.400]   that's really savory and saucy and stuff.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.680]   So I actually really love gravy.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.760]   Any restaurant that serves a Kentucky fried chicken with gravy on top with biscuits and
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.280]   gravy is like two thumbs up for me, right?
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.120]   Not a lot of people are fans, but I was a huge fan of Hometown Buffet because they had
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.760]   that kind of like Southern cooking, you know?
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.760]   Huge fan.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.320]   Now, there is the stuff I would like to eat and then there's the stuff you should eat,
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.320]   right?
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.320]   You should take care of your health.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.800]   Now, in the degree of the things that we should be doing, there's another degree where it's
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.080]   there's the things you like, there's the things that you should be doing, and there are the
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.800]   things that you must be doing.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.480]   So for example, if not only should you eat healthy, but you actually have a certain condition,
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.580]   let's say severe diabetes, you have to have certain dietary restrictions or you have to
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.360]   even take certain medication or insulin shots, right?
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.360]   And the reason why I think about this is because for us as Christians, we are given a certain
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.840]   liberties of the things that we should be doing, that we like to do, and then on a far
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.840]   degree things that we must be doing.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.080]   Now, let's take it another step further.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.720]   For us as believers, our God has given us things that actually are beyond even must
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.720]   do.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.160]   There are things that if we didn't do, it would indicate that there's something wrong
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.160]   with us.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.440]   It would be an incredible problem of identity because that in which we must do is a part
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.080]   of who we are and it defines us.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.920]   An example of that is when Christ our Lord says, "You are a light.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.160]   You are a light by design, by nature, and so you're not to be put under a bowl, but
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.120]   rather you're supposed to be seen.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.160]   You're supposed to shine to the glory of God."
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.680]   To that degree, this is a part of who we should be, right?
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.560]   In terms of us being a light of the gospel, being a reflection of God's glory, a taste
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.440]   of who God is, so to speak, that is something that is not on the level of, you know, me
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.360]   as a Christian, maybe, you know, I should kind of share a little bit.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.260]   Is this something I like to do versus other things I like to do?
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.880]   We realize that according to the will design of God, this is part of who we are as how
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.520]   God sees us.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.200]   Now, as I think about this concept, I think about the book of Revelations that we just
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.960]   covered in our Bible study.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.840]   Many of you followed along in that study.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.160]   And all the more as I think about that book, there was an impression that was made on us,
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.160]   right?
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.960]   A lot of times, like the discussion questions were very similar.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.640]   There weren't lots of small detailed applications.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.080]   For example, like you should go and forgive your brother.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.960]   You should speak in a certain tone.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.120]   You should have this attitude among you, etc.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.080]   But rather, it was a general impression.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.440]   And what was that impression?
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.920]   The impression was, "Oh my goodness, I've got to share."
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.840]   The impression was, "Oh my goodness, I'm thinking about my family member, a brother, parents,
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.720]   you know, whoever it may be that's close to your friend, was it not?"
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.520]   And so likewise, as I think about this topic of being a light, all the more there is a
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.560]   sense in my heart as we just ended the book of Revelation, we have to do something about
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.840]   what we saw in the book of Revelation.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.240]   And as we saw what God was doing, as we saw what God is going to do, there was a natural
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.120]   response of, "We need to be the light.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.680]   We have to be."
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.440]   And truly, that is how God has ordained it.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.120]   Now what's interesting, added upon that, for me personally, we've been going through the
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.960]   book of Exodus with the youth group, and that sentiment has been the same.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.960]   There is so much corollary between how it feels to read the book of Revelation with
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.120]   how it feels to read the first and many chapters of Exodus.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.000]   Many chapters of Exodus.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.520]   There is this eminent disaster to come.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.640]   There is an incredible succession of God's wrath and judgment.
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.800]   There is the warnings.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.200]   There is the stubbornness of heart.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.400]   And at the end of reading the book of Exodus, I just felt like, "Oh my goodness, we need
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.800]   to be the light."
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.600]   And so today I want to share that heart with you.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.760]   And the way I want to do it is, in surveying several themes of the book of Exodus, we want
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:19.120]   to think about what God is doing, how He is unfolding and revealing Himself and His plans,
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.300]   and then to respond appropriately, "Yes, we must be the light."
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.160]   This is how God has designed it.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.840]   So that we would graduate from, "I don't know if I like it, or maybe I should," to, "We
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.840]   must.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.880]   We absolutely must."
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.920]   So now let's take a look at Exodus chapter 7, verses 1 and down, and look at the Word
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.920]   of God.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:48.160]   It says, "Then the Lord said to Moses, 'See, I make you as God to Pharaoh, and your brother
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.480]   Aaron shall be your prophet.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.740]   You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall speak to Pharaoh
[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.260]   that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land.
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.260]   But I will harden Pharaoh's heart that I may multiply my signs and my wonders in the land
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.840]   of Egypt.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.140]   When Pharaoh does not listen to you, then I will lay my hand on Egypt and bring out
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:15.080]   my hosts, my people, the sons of Israel, from the land of Egypt by great judgments.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.900]   The Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord.
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.500]   And I stretch out my hand on Egypt and bring out the sons of Israel from their mist.'
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.620]   So Moses and Aaron did it as the Lord commanded them, thus they did.
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.820]   Moses was 80 years old and Aaron 83 when they spoke to Pharaoh."
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.980]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:41.860]   Father, we want to again thank you for the privilege of coming together, gathering as
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:47.880]   a body, joined together by your grace and the gospel of Christ, joined together by our
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.380]   faith and our relationship with you.
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.380]   And Lord, as we think about you and consider your ways, I pray, God, that today we would
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:01.740]   truly be challenged in thinking about our purpose, the mission of our lives, but what's
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.740]   more that we would really consider how you have been working in past and how you are
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.740]   working now.
[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.860]   I pray again, Lord, that you continue to open our eyes and give us insight into your word
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.900]   that's in Christ and we pray.
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.900]   Amen.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.780]   So we're thinking about this idea of being the light.
[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:25.700]   We're thinking about the idea of shining that glorious knowledge of who God is and
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.020]   representing him to the world, right?
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:34.160]   And the way, again, I want to approach it was thematically, how is God working?
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:40.240]   So the very first point I want to give to you is the theme of judgment.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.120]   The theme of judgment.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:48.360]   And the command or the exhortation I want to give is you must speak to Pharaoh because
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.760]   God is multiplying his judgments.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.760]   Okay?
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.320]   And I'm going to explain that piece by piece.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:01.000]   But the exhortation to us as a first point is you must speak to Pharaoh because God is
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.020]   multiplying his judgments.
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:08.280]   So as we think about this concept, one of the themes that we see in the book of Exodus
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.480]   is clearly the judgment of God, right?
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:18.040]   Actually we see him laying out and predicting or foretelling what he's about to do, shedding
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:22.400]   that light upon Pharaoh through Moses and saying this is exactly what's going to happen,
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:29.440]   both on a grand scale like a nation level and the judgment also on a particular personal
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.200]   level to Pharaoh himself, right?
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.640]   Now as we think about this idea of judgment, let's put it in a frame of mind or context
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.080]   by thinking about this.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.840]   We've seen in recent history there has truly been lots of tragedies.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.000]   There has been shootings, senseless violence.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.480]   There has been lots of natural disasters of hurricanes and droughts and winter storms
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.080]   right now and all the like, right?
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.160]   There has been the ongoing conflict of nations that causes, you know, refugees and people
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:06.040]   and families to be broken and split and all kinds of insecurities and people living in
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.040]   fear, okay?
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.960]   So there's been a lot of that.
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:17.480]   Now in thinking about some of these tragedies, we sometimes get really just, you know, really
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:23.680]   flustered and frustrated and then the sentiments of being just rattled like how can this be?
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.600]   But imagine if something like let's say the Las Vegas shooting happened and an individual
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:34.680]   came to you and said that, my friend, is the judgment of God.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.360]   How would you feel about that?
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:43.280]   Actually let's say if it happened to be that you had a close relative who was a victim
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.200]   of that kind of senseless shooting.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:52.160]   How would you feel about someone saying and that is a judgment of God?
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.680]   Naturally we would sense, like how can you say that?
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.320]   How do you even know, right?
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.360]   What's more, they would automatically be like, dude, I don't know if we can say that because
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:09.280]   then we'd be saying that that violence was intended by God, right?
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.960]   That's what we'd be saying.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.160]   That that kind of the number of death, that kind of number of suffering, the magnitude
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:22.200]   and the extent of that kind of pain was inflicted intentionally by God?
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.720]   That seems quite wild.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.200]   But the thing about it is when we look at the Exodus story, we talk about it as miracles,
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.920]   wonders, and plagues of God.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:39.160]   But the extent of the death that occurred in that series of judgments, it's so severe,
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:44.280]   it's so extensive, it's so stacked on each other, not to again diminish anything about
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:50.000]   what's happening recently, but in all honesty, in comparison, it seems small.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.680]   Because what God was doing to the nation of Egypt at that time, at the time of Exodus,
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.680]   was devastating.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.640]   I mean, it'd be an understatement to say it.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:03.160]   It was frightening, it was terrifying, and the kind of pain and terror that the Egyptians
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.320]   felt is unimaginable.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.720]   Let's take a moment to think about some of that by reviewing the level of intensity,
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:16.400]   the extent of how far it went by reviewing some of these plagues, so to speak, that we
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.560]   know of from Bible stories.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.300]   So turn your Bibles over to Exodus chapter 7, verse 20, and we're going to be kind of
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.920]   surveying various passages through our Bibles today, okay?
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:35.360]   So right now we're looking at the severity and extent of the judgments that God is multiplying.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:41.040]   If you remember, Moses goes to Pharaoh, Pharaoh has this heart and heart and says, "Who's
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.040]   God?
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.960]   I don't know your God, I'm not going to obey him," right?
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.360]   Paraphrasing there, but essentially he said, "I don't know you," right?
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.520]   That's the extent that he said.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:55.800]   And then what happens is God gives the very first plague and it's denial turning into
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.800]   blood.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.960]   Exodus chapter 7, verse 20 reads like this.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.700]   So Moses and Aaron did even as the Lord had commanded.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:07.080]   He lifted up the staff and struck the water that was in the Nile, in the sight of Pharaoh
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.880]   and the sight of his servants, and all the water that was in the Nile was turned to blood.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:17.240]   The fish that were in the Nile died and the Nile became foul so that the Egyptians could
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:23.320]   not drink the water from the Nile, and the blood was through all the land of Egypt.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.320]   Imagine that.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.080]   See, the thing is sometimes because we've never been to the Nile, we think, "Oh, wow,
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.960]   the river turned to blood."
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.160]   Do you guys know that some portions of the Nile is over two and a half miles wide?
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.040]   I mean, think about a body of water, I mean, one of the biggest bodies of water you've
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.040]   ever seen.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.280]   The Nile is huge.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.840]   You know your geography, how long it runs.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.920]   For the Nile to turn to blood is devastating.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.080]   There's source of fishing, there's source of commerce, there's source of transportation.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:13:00.680]   The Nile to them was like their provider, and so they worship the Nile as the life giver.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.800]   But here's the crazy thing.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.960]   The reason why I say this is so intense is because through reading again, I caught this
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.220]   detail.
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:13.920]   In verse 19, it says that the extent of the water turning to blood was pervasive.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.920]   What does it say?
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.320]   "Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Say to Aaron, take your staff and stretch out your hand
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:25.360]   over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, over their pools, over
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.480]   all their reservoirs of water, that they may become blood.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:34.680]   And there will be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in the vessels of wood
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.320]   and the vessels of stone.'"
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.320]   Did you catch that detail?
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:43.080]   You see, I would just assume like, okay, the Nile turned to blood, wow, it's a devastating
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.080]   thing.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.760]   But every source of water that they had, even the reservoirs in their home, even their baskets,
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.720]   they turned to blood.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:56.280]   And then later it talks about how this miracle, this devastating plague that God has sent
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.840]   on them, it lasted for seven days.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.800]   So what I didn't realize was initially there's a sentiment where I looked at the plagues
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:10.320]   and thought of it as like just small inflictions that started to ramp up from the very beginning,
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.600]   I bet there was death.
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.600]   Why?
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.840]   Try going seven days without water.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.840]   Scientifically, after two and a half days, you're going to start hallucinating because
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.280]   of dehydration.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.400]   You cannot last that long.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:28.280]   And so it says in the scripture that as God inflicted that kind of plague on the people,
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.760]   they became mad and they were starting to dig the ground for any kind of water they
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:32.760]   could find.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.800]   That was the kind of devastation that God is inflicting on the people.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.040]   But you guys know the story goes and goes, that He starts to stack and multiply these
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.040]   judgments.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.960]   And there was the infestation of the frogs, which is super gross.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.320]   And it says it was in their bed, in their kneading bowls, and everywhere.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.600]   And then there were flies, which I think were like mosquitoes probably.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.520]   Because there's actually for our youth group, we started studying some ancient manuscripts
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.360]   from the Egyptians about like swarms of these bugs that would actually bite them and they
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.720]   would have infection and stuff.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.480]   So there were these flies that were biting them, maybe they were mosquitoes, but there
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.080]   was also gnats.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:15.680]   There was boils on their skin, so severe and painful, it says that the men could not stand.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:21.240]   When was the last time you were in so much pain, you just keeled over and could not get
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.240]   up?
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.480]   It's rare for us to experience pain like that.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:32.200]   Another one, please turn over to chapter 9, verse 18 through 19.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.760]   Chapter 9, 18 through 19.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:41.120]   It says, "Behold, about this time tomorrow I will send a heavy hail such has never been
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.080]   seen in Egypt from the day it was founded until now."
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.560]   That's so epic, right?
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.000]   "Now therefore send, bring your livestock and whatever you have in the field to safety.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.960]   Every man and beast that is found in the field that is not brought home, when the hail comes
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.160]   down on them, will die."
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:04.480]   So this is crazy, the surmounting kind of the plague and judgment that is coming upon
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.920]   them, because this hail was crushing the trees, it was killing the livestock, and even the
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.360]   servants in the field.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:16.080]   In a previous plague was that God was actually, he sent a plague that killed all the cattle
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:21.320]   and the flocks of the Egyptians, but saved the cattle and the flock of the Jews.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.720]   And even if that wasn't enough, God sends a swarm of locusts.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:31.600]   It's a swarm so big, he says that it was covering the land and a cloud of darkness
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.600]   went over them.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.920]   If you actually Google videos of locust swarm, it's crazy.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.880]   They have them out in Australia right now and people are frightened because of them.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.880]   Why?
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.280]   The locust swarm can be 30 miles wide.
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.400]   That's like from here to Cerritos, you know, it's crazy.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.080]   Imagine locust swarm that big.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:55.180]   And what's more, if it is unhindered, in even just a small plot of land, like a hundred
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.760]   square foot, there could be over 200,000 locusts.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.680]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:05.080]   If you Google it, you can find videos of it that happen even now, but it's past, the
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.240]   scripture says it was like never before.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:11.040]   And the people were so, so distraught by that they started going to Pharaoh and saying,
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:15.400]   "Listen, we're your servants, but you're crazy."
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.520]   They say this in Exodus chapter 10, 7.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.680]   They said, "How long will this man be a snare to us?
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.440]   Let the man go, that they may serve their Lord God.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:29.520]   Do you not realize that Egypt is destroyed?"
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:34.920]   The next plague was a darkness, a darkness so severe it says they could feel it.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.120]   It's almost like they could touch the darkness.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.520]   A lot of people think like, "Oh yeah, there was an eclipse."
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.520]   No, no.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.600]   It was a kind of darkness, the scripture says man could not get out of bed because he couldn't
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.600]   move.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.600]   He couldn't see the man in front of him.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:53.560]   It was a supernatural, complete pitch darkness where they could not operate.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:18:00.720]   And the last one, and the last one, as you guys know, is the one where God said, "I am
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:07.440]   precisely inflicting this miracle on you, this plague on you, because you would not
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.900]   let my firstborn go, my people Israel."
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.640]   And so he says, "I will kill the firstborn of this land."
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:20.840]   Turn to Exodus 11, verse 4-6.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.720]   Exodus 11, verse 4-6.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:30.120]   Moses said, "Thus says the Lord, 'About midnight I am going out in the midst of Egypt, and
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.920]   all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.000]   From the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the slave
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   girl who is behind the millstone, all the firstborn of the cattle as well.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.080]   Moreover, there shall be a great cry in all the land of Egypt, such as there has not been
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.080]   before and such shall never be again.'"
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.840]   That's just incredible to think about.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:04.320]   Did you know that right now in America there are 325.6 million people, okay?
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.900]   325.6 million people in America.
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.400]   We are not the biggest country in the world, but we are a superpower, yes?
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.240]   Likewise, so is Egypt.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:18.000]   Not necessarily the biggest landmass, but they were the superpower of their day.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.200]   And so statistically, according to the Census Bureau, there are 325 million people, but
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:29.200]   in terms of households that have children, there's about 115 million households.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.680]   I want you to just imagine just for a moment.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:41.160]   Actually it's almost unfathomable to think that in one dark night, every single household,
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:47.360]   every parent would experience the tremendous pain of finding that their firstborn, their
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:52.800]   precious child, the one that would carry their legacy, the one that they treasure, would
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.480]   die in their arms that night.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:01.420]   And in one single night, an entire nation from every household, there would be a cry.
[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.920]   Can you imagine that?
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.860]   That's so severe, so intense.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:11.540]   And the fact of the matter is, to me, it shatters our expectations because we would not be even
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:17.060]   willing to attribute a small, small tragedy to God and say, "Okay, maybe God caused that."
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:22.420]   Do you understand that God killed a generation of Egyptians?
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:26.380]   It shatters our expectations.
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:33.580]   The fact of the matter is, this kind of judgment was a righteous judgment from God as He was
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:39.140]   multiplying His wonders before the people of the Egyptians.
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:43.880]   And for us now, as we think about that, we think about us being a light.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.280]   We read the book of Revelation.
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.380]   Is it any less than this?
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.900]   No.
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:55.900]   As a matter of fact, the book of Exodus in the 10 plagues is probably a smaller version,
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.940]   a microcosm of what is actually to come.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:05.220]   So actually, what we know is coming is a million times worse than this.
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.220]   We're supernaturally almost in cosmic fashion.
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.780]   God is going to cause the sun to burn.
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.620]   God is going to cause a third of the world.
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:17.420]   God is going to cause supernatural heavenly beings to come down, stand on mountain and
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.920]   sea and kill a third of the people in one fell swoop.
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.660]   Like locusts, 200 million of the soldiers of the pits are going to come out and destroy
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.660]   and kill men.
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:36.100]   I mean, the things that we read in Revelation, part of it is just like truly unimaginable.
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:42.380]   So then it begs us this question, should we not warn people?
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.980]   Should we not warn people of the judgment to come?
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:51.660]   Should we not prepare people of the kind of things God is going to do in our midst because
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:56.860]   we realize what's next on the timeline, what's next on the agenda is exactly what's already
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:57.860]   written for us?
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.460]   Are we going to say like, "Oh shoot, I didn't know."
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:05.180]   What are we going to say?
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.460]   And that's why I say we have to speak.
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:13.020]   We must speak because God is multiplying his judgments and that's exactly what he's doing
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.180]   in this generation as well.
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:19.420]   Scripture is teaching us that God is storing up his wrath.
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:24.000]   He's allowing the fullness of times to come up, the fullness of the sins of man, the fullness
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.100]   of the rejection and as we preach the gospel and people reject, God is bearing that up
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:36.700]   until he deems it the right time to pour out his judgment on this generation.
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.060]   That's what we believe.
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:45.340]   Now part of the reason why I said that weird sentence of you need to speak to Pharaoh because
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.260]   that's not new to us.
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.060]   We've learned that.
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.660]   If you didn't know God is going to ultimately judge this world, then you just missed the
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:57.340]   whole part of the gospels, the epistles and revelation and prophecies and everything
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.580]   about the Bible, right?
[00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:03.580]   But the hard part about that sharing is not so much because we don't know the content
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:09.100]   of the message of warning of the consequence of sin, warning of the consequence of entering
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.140]   into the presence of a holy God.
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:16.900]   It's because we have to talk to Pharaohs, stubborn people who are resilient, who believe
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:21.860]   they are the masters of their own kingdom and domain, who just like the king and Pharaoh
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.100]   said, "Who's your God?
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.840]   I don't know him.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.840]   Why should I listen to him?"
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.060]   Those are the people we need to talk to and my bet is nine out of ten times you go out
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:38.060]   to share the gospel message of Christ, you go out to warn people about the pending doom
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.660]   and devastation that's coming, you're going to feel like you're talking to a bunch of
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:48.520]   Pharaohs who are self-confident, arrogant, unwilling to yield.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:54.780]   But the challenge to us is, but did God command something different?
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:58.260]   Did God tell Moses like, "Okay, better plan.
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:02.220]   What's more efficient is they're your enemies, I just squash them, I'll go talk to them myself."
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:06.460]   No, God has so ordained that we speak.
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.420]   How is God going to multiply these miracles?
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:17.140]   How is God going to multiply these judgments and strikes that he has for the generation?
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.360]   He's going to use us.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:29.020]   He's going to use us to speak, to warn, and to continue to again in many ways reveal even
[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.100]   what's in the heart of man.
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:35.580]   And so that's why again earlier I read you the passage in chapter seven when he says,
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.340]   "I am going to harden Pharaoh's heart."
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:43.380]   And he specifically says, "That as a purpose I may multiply my signs and my wonders.
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:47.740]   And when Pharaoh does not listen to you, then I will lay my hand on Egypt to bring out my
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:54.260]   host and my sons of Israel from the land of Egypt by great judgments."
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:25:00.140]   And then he says, "The Egyptians shall know I am the Lord."
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.700]   So even if we feel like, "Oh my goodness, they're not going to receive this.
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.340]   Oh my goodness, they're not going to take this.
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.420]   Oh my goodness, they're going to reject us."
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.740]   He's still in the plan of God.
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.940]   He desires to multiply his judgments.
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:13.940]   Amen?
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:14.940]   Okay.
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:20.980]   So that being said, we move to the second theme that we see as we work through just
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.020]   a survey of the book of Exodus.
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:30.660]   And the second theme that we normally think of when we think of book of Exodus is deliverance.
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:35.540]   And the statement of exhortation I want to say to you is you must speak to Israel because
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:39.420]   God is sovereignly delivering his people.
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:43.380]   Because God is sovereignly delivering his people.
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:50.160]   So one of the things we know to do when we read our Bibles is if there is a repetition
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.620]   of terms, things like, "I may multiply my wonders."
[00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:59.100]   He says that again and again so that you may know that I am the one true God who judges,
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.100]   right?
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.100]   That's repeated.
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.980]   But there's another theme that's repeated in the book of Exodus that a lot of people
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.260]   miss, and it's the word distinction.
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.260]   It's the word distinction.
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:14.100]   And what I mean by that is God says very explicitly, "I make a distinction between the Egyptians
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.740]   and my people."
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:19.620]   For example, in Exodus chapter 9 verse 4, okay?
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.540]   Let's work through some references here.
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:28.700]   Exodus chapter 9 verse 4, he says, "But the Lord will make a distinction between the livestock
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:35.060]   of Israel and the livestock of Egypt so that nothing will die of all that belongs to the
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.780]   sons of Israel."
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:42.260]   And then even later when the hail strikes, the land of Goshen is the only area in which
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:45.980]   the hail doesn't strike, but everything else is devastated.
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.780]   Another passage, Exodus chapter 10, okay?
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:54.740]   Exodus chapter 10 verse 22 says, "So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:59.340]   there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:03.860]   They did not see one another, nor did anyone rise from his place for three days, but all
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:07.300]   the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings."
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:08.820]   You see the distinction?
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.600]   And then even in chapter 11 verse 7, okay?
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:18.500]   Even in chapter 11 verse 7, "But against any of the sons of Israel, a dog will not even
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:24.700]   bark, whether against man or beast, that you may understand how the Lord makes a distinction
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.060]   between Egypt and Israel."
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:34.220]   You see, when I look at the past, the story of the book of Exodus, one thing that is very
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:41.940]   clear, neither Pharaoh, the Egyptian servants, or the people of God are very receptive to
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.740]   God's plans.
[00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:50.860]   You guys remember when Moses goes to Pharaoh, the Pharaoh rejects, and the Pharaoh inflicts
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:56.900]   harder kind of like workload on the Israelites, and the Israelites look at Moses and say,
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:57.900]   "Good job, buddy."
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.020]   It's like, "Way to go.
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.020]   We were fine."
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:04.520]   They weren't fine, but that's what they say, because they're all mad.
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.500]   And then they start to reject Moses, and then Moses is like, "I told you they're not going
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.660]   to listen to me."
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.300]   And that's why Moses keeps going back and forth.
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.540]   "They're not going to even believe me."
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:18.620]   So the one thing that's very clear is it's not because Israel was better than Egypt,
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:25.020]   but the fact of the matter is God being merciful is protecting, guarding, preserving, providing
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:30.140]   for the nation of Israel according to His kind intention of mercy.
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:34.620]   And that's why later on in the book of Romans, when it describes Pharaoh versus Israel and
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:41.180]   what's happening, Apostle Paul is the one to say, "God chooses, and He has prerogative.
[00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:43.500]   He has sovereignty to decide.
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.060]   I have mercy on whom I have mercy.
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:50.740]   And if I choose you to be a vessel to show my judgment, then I'm glorious for that.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:55.540]   But if I choose you to show my mercy, then I'm glorious for that."
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:59.180]   And so when we think about this, we think about the nation of Israel and how God has
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.340]   treated them.
[00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.380]   You guys remember the story of the last plague.
[00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:08.180]   The last plague comes where God predicts and foretells and says, "I am going to kill the
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.100]   firstborn."
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.420]   You know what's really interesting about that scenario?
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:17.580]   If you were an Israelite, you'd be already thinking by like the fifth plague, "We win.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.500]   Look at this.
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.460]   By the fifth plague, a bunch of the Egyptians have died.
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.460]   They're devastated.
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.980]   Their power in terms of their wealth, a lot of it's being destroyed.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.260]   They've got animals that are dead.
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.900]   They have people that are sick.
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.120]   I mean, the Israelites should have been thinking, "We win.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.120]   Let's take over the palace.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.120]   Let's make Moses our leader.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.120]   Let's go."
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.120]   Right?
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.020]   But no.
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:42.300]   They were still in need of deliverance.
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:48.000]   And God provided for them and said, "Shed the blood of a blameless lamb.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.700]   Take the blood and cover your doorpost.
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:55.080]   Go into your home with all your children as a family and have this meal to commemorate
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.420]   this night."
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:02.360]   And all the children would wear their tunics, almost like they're getting ready to go outside.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.460]   The father would take his staff like he's ready to go on a hike.
[00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.700]   He'd wear his shoes.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:10.020]   They would make the unleavened bread that has no yeast.
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:12.060]   And they would eat in haste, it says.
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.460]   And they would eat really fast.
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.020]   And the children's like, "What's going on?"
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:21.220]   And the father would explain, "The Lord had mercy on us.
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.500]   He spared us.
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.420]   He has passed over us because of the lamb.
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.940]   He has had grace on us and he's going to deliver us."
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.740]   Deliver us from what?
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:32.140]   Deliver them simply from the Egyptians?
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:33.140]   No.
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.140]   God's already doing that.
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:38.380]   Delivering them from the wrath of God.
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:44.060]   And so the reason why I'm making much of this is because the Exodus, the prime focal point
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:51.100]   is how God with his wonders and his miracles is delivering the people and sparing them
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.740]   for you now.
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:31:00.700]   Does this message of being spared, does it excite you, inspire you, cause you to be passionate
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.620]   and say, "Look how we've been spared.
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.940]   Save me in this safety."
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:11.020]   And as you, you know, again, I make the mention of, yes, we need to talk to Pharaoh, we need
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.020]   to talk to Israelites.
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:16.700]   Now, there isn't a clear one-to-one corollary of who are the Israelites in our day.
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.700]   We don't even necessarily make that kind of transition.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:24.380]   But there are clearly people who are different from, let's say, the stubborn, hearted, arrogant
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.500]   Pharaoh looking for answers.
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:31.460]   There may be just like the Israelites, feeling oppressed, they're feeling pain, they're
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:35.460]   feeling like they've got nothing, they're in despair, and they're looking for hope and
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:39.420]   they're wondering, "Can I find hope in God?"
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:48.620]   Can you then experientially say to the people, "Yes, resounding yes, look at me.
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.260]   Look at the grace I've received in the Lord.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.260]   I want you to experience the same."
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:59.740]   And did you know, did you know that in the mass Exodus of the Israelites out of Egypt,
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:04.060]   there were those of the Egyptians who saw the hail coming and said, "I will duck for
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:08.020]   cover," and they found cover in God.
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.700]   We need to be able to give that kind of exhortation.
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:15.340]   There is a time and place to preach judgment because that's going to glorify God, and there's
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:18.780]   a time and place to say, "God loves you."
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:24.780]   That if you repent, this holy God who would judge an entire nation will forgive repentant
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:26.860]   sinners, amen?
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.060]   We have to be able to preach that.
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:33.860]   And that's why I say you must speak because God is sovereignly delivering His people.
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:40.700]   He has provided us a way to escape His wrath through the blood of His Son, to escape eternal
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:49.920]   damnation and not simply pointlessness, boredom, pain, sorrow, but to escape God's own wrath.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.060]   That is something that maybe I should.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.060]   Do I like sharing that?
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:03.620]   Should we understand that that is something that we must, we must speak of, amen?
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:14.020]   Now thirdly, the last theme is that we might know God is knowledge.
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:19.060]   The way that God is unfolding the events of the book of Exodus, there is a question mark
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:24.220]   as to like, "Is this all necessary?"
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:29.260]   Like the hardening of Pharaoh's heart, Moses going over, and Moses is essentially saying
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.700]   that, "Is this all necessary?"
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.460]   But the answer is yes.
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:38.540]   And the exhortation I want to give you is you must speak to all the peoples of the earth
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:44.940]   because God is sovereignly revealing the knowledge of Himself and desiring that all would come
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:45.940]   to repentance.
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:49.460]   Now I know that's not short or memorable, but that's so important and we're going to
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:55.380]   tackle it phrase by phrase, that we must speak to all the peoples of the earth.
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.820]   We must speak to the Pharaohs, we must speak to the nation of Israel, we must speak to
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:05.260]   the nations because God is sovereignly revealing the knowledge of Himself and desiring that
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.740]   all would come to repentance.
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:12.540]   One of the very important thematic things that we saw, we saw when we read the initial
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:19.260]   passage in chapter 7 at the beginning of the plagues, when God says, "I'm going to multiply
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:24.460]   my judgments," and then He said, "So that the Egyptians might know I am God."
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:30.140]   The Egyptians know idols, the Egyptians know created things like the Nile, like animals,
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:33.220]   like snakes, and all that kind of stuff, and they render power.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:35.420]   They don't know me.
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:41.840]   And God is going to be glorified by the magnification of the knowledge of who He is.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.180]   But as you guys know, that has been the heart of God for this generation as well.
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:52.220]   There's a passage in 1 Timothy 2 verse 4 that says, "God desires all people to be saved
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:57.820]   and to come to the knowledge of the truth."
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:05.860]   Please turn in your Bible, since we're at Exodus, to Exodus 10 verse 1 and 2.
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:13.180]   He says, "Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:17.540]   and the heart of his servants, that I may perform these signs of mine among them, and
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:23.380]   that you may tell in the hearing of your son and of your grandson, how I made a mockery
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:30.380]   of the Egyptians, and I performed my signs among them, that you may know that I am the
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.580]   Lord.'"
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:36.860]   So we asked the question earlier, there is, what is God doing?
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:42.380]   And by seeing what is God doing, we attach ourselves and say, "That's what I must do."
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:47.740]   Not just a desire, not just that I ought to, should to, but I must.
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:54.160]   What God is doing is revealing and unfolding who He is, and He wants generations to know.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.840]   He wants nations to know.
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:00.940]   And in this passage, Exodus chapter 10, He makes that clear commandment to Moses, "I
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:06.380]   want you to teach this to your sons and the generations after them, what I have done,
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:10.640]   that they might know I am God Almighty."
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.960]   And that's the way we need to think about it.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:19.860]   So for us, when we think about us being the light, we are not simply just propagating
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.440]   doctrinal statements.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.660]   Not simply.
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.660]   We are teaching doctrine.
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.340]   We are giving vision.
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.200]   We are giving a statement of faith.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.560]   We are giving a statement of the gospel.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.540]   This is the gospel of Christ.
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.340]   God Almighty is your creator.
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.340]   You have sinned.
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.340]   You need to reconcile.
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:42.600]   And that reconciliation comes through one person, one mediator, Jesus Christ, who shed
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:49.940]   His blood for you, that you could repent and God forgive you in His name.
[00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.100]   Those are doctrinal things, right?
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:56.740]   However, us shining the light goes beyond the doctrinal statements because we want to
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:04.020]   go beyond just educating people, but we want to show them, "Look, this is God.
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.120]   He's glorious.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.840]   He's all the things that we read about of His holiness, of His righteousness, but of
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.620]   His grace, mercy, and kindness.
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.820]   His patience and longsuffering with us.
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.520]   All of that.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:19.980]   All of that is what we want to shine to the nations, amen?"
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:26.460]   And that's why for us, there's a sense to which the biggest problem that we face is
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:33.880]   not people just simply not going to church, but what is it that they believe about God
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:37.400]   that gives them permission to not go to church?
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:41.740]   Every time I have these holidays, we all get together with our extended family, and it's
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:42.740]   pretty hilarious.
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:48.300]   I get together with different parts of the family, and it always seems like the older
[00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:51.700]   generation just wants to know, "Are you going to church?"
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:55.180]   And then maybe your cousins or distant relatives are less like, "I've been busy.
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.180]   I haven't gone to church."
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.060]   They're like, "Go to church!"
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:02.060]   And we sometimes want to just tell people to do it, just go to church, okay?
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.060]   And then hopefully everything will work out.
[00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.380]   But we know it goes deeper than that.
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:15.460]   What is it that you believe about God that says to you, "Don't render to Him your time"?
[00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:19.700]   What is it that you believe and how you perceive about God that says to you, "This time is
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:20.700]   my time.
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:21.700]   This money is my money.
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.900]   My life is mine to live and not yours"?
[00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.620]   That's what we're talking about right now.
[00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:33.740]   God's being a light to the nations, to everyone, is to reveal the nature of God that He is
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:40.460]   Lord of all, that He's the good Lord of all, the loving, gracious Lord of all.
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:42.980]   And that is our evangelistic efforts.
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:44.380]   That is what we're trying to do.
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:48.140]   And therefore, the problem with people is not simply they don't have resources, they're
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:50.460]   in too much pain, they're suffering, all this kind of stuff.
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.260]   This problem simply is they don't know God.
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:57.180]   Likewise, for Pharaoh, what was his problem?
[00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:02.260]   It was in Exodus chapter 5 when Moses went to him and says, "Let my people go that they
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:03.980]   may worship God."
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:08.340]   And Pharaoh said, "Who is your Lord?
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:10.060]   I don't know Him."
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.500]   That's what he said.
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:15.820]   And that's why even later on, did you know Pharaoh, after being inflicted, there were
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.460]   certain moments when he was just broke.
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.780]   He was like, "Oh my goodness."
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:25.380]   For example, there was a moment in Exodus chapter 10 when Pharaoh hurriedly went to
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:26.380]   Moses.
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:30.540]   He sought him out and he just rushed to him and said this, "I have sinned against the
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:32.740]   Lord your God and against you.
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:35.500]   Now therefore, please forgive my sin.
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:36.500]   Only this once."
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:40.140]   Doesn't that sound like a good repentant sinner?
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.740]   No, he was not.
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:43.820]   Why?
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.400]   Because he did not gain a view of God.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:51.820]   As soon as the hail went away, as soon as the storm went away, as soon as the darkness
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:55.220]   went away, only thing he saw was his circumstance.
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:58.140]   Only thing he saw was the removal of his pain and his suffering.
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.460]   And then he said, "What God?"
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.660]   And he hardened his heart.
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:09.020]   Likewise, for us, if in the way that we evangelize, we don't just do it any other way.
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:12.420]   We don't just do it to that which we think is most effective.
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.420]   Why?
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:19.600]   Because it doesn't show that connection with the reality of who God is.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.240]   If we wanted to, we could be.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.680]   We could be offering all this kind of goods and services.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:27.600]   We could say, "Hey, we'll do your taxes for free because tax season's coming up.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:28.600]   We'll offer you coffee.
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.600]   We'll offer you beverage.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.600]   We'll offer you child care.
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:31.600]   We'll offer you this."
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.480]   And then just draw everybody in.
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:41.060]   But does that communicate, "Man, we come to worship and we serve this holy God."
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:44.120]   And that needs to be within our evangelism, amen?
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:47.160]   Because that speaks of who God is.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.880]   That's what we need to do.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:54.020]   So in thinking about this general statement, we want to be lights.
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.340]   We know that it's above and beyond.
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:41:01.360]   It's above and beyond just a, "I don't know if I like it or not or maybe I should."
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:04.280]   It's every single one of us.
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:10.640]   We must, by nature of what God is doing, by nature of how God has made us, by nature of
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:15.440]   what amazing things God is doing both in the past and now.
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:19.460]   And one other thing I want to tell you now as a way to look then, what other amazing
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:25.440]   thing is God doing that would inspire us to evangelize is to ask this question, "What
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:28.360]   is God's plan for the Egyptians?
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.880]   How did God treat them after?"
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.920]   Because what we know is God is sovereign over all time and space.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.680]   God was not sovereign over Egypt just when God was judging them.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:42.120]   But after God delivered the nation of Israel, there's this question mark like, "What happened
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:45.260]   to the nation of Egypt and how did God treat them?"
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:50.720]   Because even authorities, rulers, now and then, they're all under the sovereignty of
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.960]   God.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.960]   So what happened to them?
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.840]   Well, there's an interesting passage.
[00:41:54.840 --> 00:42:06.840]   Please turn your Bibles to Isaiah chapter 19.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.240]   We asked the question, "What is happening to the Egyptians?"
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:11.960]   And this passage, Isaiah chapter 19, answers it.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:15.960]   It says, "This is the oracle for Egypt."
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.880]   It says, starting from verse 1 through 4, "Behold, the Lord is riding on a swift cloud
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.760]   and is about to come to Egypt.
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:27.560]   The idols of Egypt will tremble at His presence and the heart of the Egyptians will melt within
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:28.560]   them."
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:29.560]   Wow.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.640]   "So I will incite Egyptians against Egyptians.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.080]   They will each fight against his brother and each against his neighbor.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.760]   City against city and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.880]   And the spirit of the Egyptians will be demoralized within them."
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:42.880]   Oh my goodness.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:47.680]   "And I will confound their strategy so that they will resort to idols and ghosts of the
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.280]   dead and to mediums of spirits.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:53.240]   Moreover, I will deliver the Egyptians into the hand of cruel masters.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:57.240]   A mighty king will rule over them, declares the Lord God of hosts."
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.240]   Whew.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.240]   That's crazy.
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.880]   "Your heart will melt.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:06.240]   I'll demoralize you and you will be under subjection the rest of your existence."
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.240]   Wow.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.240]   Right?
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.240]   You know what's crazy?
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.920]   That has come true.
[00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:15.360]   Did you know that the nation of Egypt, although they were a superpower, so powerful, they
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:20.760]   had massive slaves, all kinds of resources, you know, wonders of the world, right?
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.520]   From then on, there was always internal conflict.
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:27.920]   They were subjugated by the Assyrians and then they were subjugated by the Babylonians.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.880]   They were subjugated by the Persians and then later on the Greeks.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.440]   And then everybody basically had a turn with them almost.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.680]   It was crazy.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:40.000]   And then we just wonder like, wow, you know, God's judgment is severe.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.920]   Let's scroll down a little bit and see if there's more though.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:48.840]   Verse 16, it says this, "In that day, the Egyptians will become like woman and they
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:53.320]   will tremble and be in dread because of the waving of the hand of the Lord of hosts, which
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.760]   he is going to wave over them.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.620]   The hand of Judah will become a tear of Egypt.
[00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.960]   Everyone to whom it is mentioned will be in dread of it because of the purpose of the
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:05.280]   Lord of hosts, which he is purposing against them."
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.840]   Basically, it gets worse.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.960]   It doesn't get any better.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:14.480]   But yet still, yet still, we read on and there's more.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:19.280]   Scroll your eyes down to verse 19 and it says, "In that day, there will be an altar to the
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:24.800]   Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt and a pillar to the Lord near its borders.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:29.300]   They will become a sign and a witness of the Lord of hosts in the land of Egypt, for they
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:34.440]   will cry to the Lord because of the oppressors and he will send them a savior and a champion
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:35.440]   and he will deliver them."
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.120]   Whoa, wait, what?
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.720]   Who is he talking to?
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:48.920]   Verse 21, "Thus the Lord will make himself known to Egypt and the Egyptians will know
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.540]   the Lord in that day.
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:54.820]   They will even worship with sacrifice and offering and will make a vow to the Lord and
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:56.340]   perform it.
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:59.420]   The Lord will strike Egypt, striking but healing.
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:04.700]   So they will return to the Lord and he will respond to them and will heal them.
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:08.900]   In that day, there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria and the Assyrians will come
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:11.500]   into Egypt and the Egyptians into Assyria.
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.200]   Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:17.500]   In that day, Israel will be the third party with Egypt and Assyria and the blessing in
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.580]   the midst of the earth."
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:26.340]   See look at this, verse 25, "Whom the Lord of hosts has blessed, saying, 'Blessed is
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:32.980]   Egypt my people and Assyria the works of my hands and Israel my inheritance.'"
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:36.660]   What?
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.940]   This is crazy.
[00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:44.540]   You see, earlier what I was saying was I was making multiple points here, that God multiplies
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.780]   his judgment and he's glorified.
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:50.140]   And although he's multiplying his judgment, there's almost a frustration in our mind,
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:52.300]   if you're going to do that, just get it over with.
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.380]   Why do you need us to go and preach that judgment?
[00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.460]   But we still need to do it, right?
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.940]   And then God is being gracious and God is going to multiply that graciousness and show
[00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:06.500]   it to be grand and in that graciousness and that mercy, he's going to be glorified, right?
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:12.860]   And through it all, what we're going to realize is God is using us and in all of it, God is
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:18.620]   working out his marvelous plan to which we cannot even comprehend.
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.140]   What we predict might not work, God will make it work.
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.700]   What we predict is going to work is probably not going to work.
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:30.740]   It is all going to be according to his sovereignty, his timeline, according to his mercy, amen?
[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:35.660]   But when I look at this, that God would even be merciful to the Egyptians and then call
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:40.700]   them, "They will be blessed and my people," that is amazing.
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:46.220]   And when I see that, I automatically feel a sense of, "Therefore, I must be a light,"
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:51.380]   because I know how is God going to reveal the knowledge of who he is to the people like
[00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:52.540]   Egyptians?
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.660]   How he's going to bring them to this point?
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:56.100]   How he's going to bring them along?
[00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.340]   You know how he's going to do this.
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.060]   How are they going to hear?
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:01.060]   How will they see?
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:09.940]   God is going to use you, your mouth, your changed life, your passion, your love for
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:11.500]   Christ.
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:15.500]   And therefore we say, "Lord, I must speak of you."
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.500]   Amen?
[00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:19.500]   Let's pray.
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:28.900]   Heavenly Father, your ways truly are above and beyond us.
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:34.540]   Even in the well-known story of the plagues of Exodus, we realize you are working in multiple
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:41.220]   layers for your purposes beyond what Moses could see, the people could see, and maybe
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:43.500]   what even we could understand.
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:49.660]   That in all this, you are also both showing all the elements of your righteousness, your
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:53.380]   patience, and then ultimately your plan to save.
[00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:59.820]   God, truly you are a wonderful God, and I pray that as we see you in greater light,
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:05.300]   you would help us to be able to articulate and to share about what we see.
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:10.140]   I pray, Father God, that all the more you would grant to us just deeper conviction of
[00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:16.100]   the things that we see and that we receive, that truly, Lord, we would be witnesses and
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:17.740]   vessels to your glory.
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:19.060]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:19.560]   Amen.
