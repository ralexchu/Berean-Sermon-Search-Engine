[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   All right, let's give him a hand again.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.080]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 3, verses 7 through 11.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.640]   Hebrews chapter 3, verses 7 through 11.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.400]   I'm going to read out of the NASB.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.600]   "Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, 'Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.840]   your hearts as when they provoked me, as in the day of trial in the wilderness, where
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.200]   your fathers tried me by testing me, and saw my works for forty years.'
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.320]   Therefore, I was angry with this generation and said, 'They always go astray in their
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.720]   heart, and they did not know my ways.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.600]   As I swore in my wrath, they shall not enter my rest.'"
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.120]   Let's pray.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.960]   Gracious Father, we pray for your blessing.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.200]   We pray for the Spirit of God to use the words that you have ordained and illuminate our
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.200]   hearts.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.040]   He who has ears, let him hear.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.480]   I pray that your Son's voice may be made clear, that your children may hear His voice and
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.800]   follow Him and Him alone.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.920]   We ask for your anointing and your blessing over this time.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.880]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.700]   The text that we're looking at this morning is a warning against apostasy.
[00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.000]   It is not limited to this text.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.080]   In fact, you can say, you know, the title of the book of Hebrews is "Glorification of
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.440]   Christ" or "Exalting of Christ" or "Fixing your eyes upon Christ," but there's a reason
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.360]   why the author has chosen to go into detailed Christology.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.400]   And the reason why is because there's a danger of this church starting to slip into apostasy.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.880]   So what he's saying here in this text, where he says in the previous week, "Consider Christ,"
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.080]   is the reason why he is telling them to consider Christ, because of this drifting and this
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.320]   danger of apostasy for this church.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.640]   If you've been a Christian for any period of time, and I ask you, can you think of one
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.040]   individual that you thought, when you were younger, when you first became a Christian,
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.240]   that that person was a genuine Christian, or he was on fire for God, but is no longer
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.480]   walking with the Lord today?
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.800]   I can guess, from my experience and my conversation and my own personal life, that probably, if
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.000]   not all, most of you will be able to name at least one or many people that at one point
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.960]   walked with the Lord, is no longer walking with God today.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.880]   And maybe it might even have surprised you that these people were people that led you,
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.320]   encouraged you at one point, but they're not with the Lord anymore.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:48.760]   I remember very specifically, as a young pastor, seeing some of the people that I felt like
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.040]   was headed toward the right direction, but various things would happen in their life,
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.960]   and then seeing them just drift away and walk away from God.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.960]   And I remember early on in ministry, it felt like a punch in the gut, you know, like investing
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:09.000]   so much time in prayer, meeting small groups, counseling, and then to have an event or something
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.800]   happen and just kind of walking away from God, thinking, "Man, this is just too hard."
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.880]   But since then, I've seen so many people walk away from their faith that it's no longer
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.280]   surprising.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.920]   In fact, it shouldn't be, but I've almost become numb to it.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.320]   If anything, it's more surprising to see people persevere and stay on fire for God for a long
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.360]   period of time, because it's that rare.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.800]   Sad to say.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.960]   I remember this one particular event.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.360]   Years ago, I was talking to an individual, and this young lady that used to be in my
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.880]   college ministry, she saw me talking, and I haven't seen her in a decade.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.040]   So she's already gotten married, and she was in her early 30s, and she was walking by,
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.880]   seeing me having one-to-one with somebody.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.360]   And I guess she recognized me, and she tapped me on the shoulder and said, "Hey, Pastor
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.360]   Peter, remember me?"
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.080]   And I turned around, "Yeah, sure enough.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.480]   It's been over 10 years."
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.140]   And so I was very glad to see her, and we did a little bit of small talk.
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.920]   And as she was walking away, she looked at me, and she said, "Oh, you guys meeting together.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.280]   This must be some sort of counseling session or discipleship or something."
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.840]   And then she looked at me and said, "Oh, you're still doing the Jesus thing, huh?"
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.160]   And then I just kind of nodded my head, just kind of in nervous laughter, and then she
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.160]   just walked away.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.040]   And I remember as she was walking away, thinking, "Wow, she fell that far away."
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.520]   Because I remember in college, she would have been one of the people that I would have chosen
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.480]   in saying, "This person is going to be on fire for God and bear much fruit for the kingdom."
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.080]   But whatever happened in the last 10 years, she was actually surprised that I was still
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.640]   preaching the gospel.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:52.280]   Every single one of you can probably think of somebody and may have wondered, "What happened?
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.720]   How did somebody who seemed to be that committed and that focused, that sacrificial at one
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.360]   point in their life, drift that far away?"
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.680]   Webster's Dictionary describes the word apostasy as an act of refusing to continue to follow,
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.120]   obey, or recognize a religious faith.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.240]   And that's a secular definition of apostasy.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.000]   Second Thessalonians 2.2, Paul warns that before Christ comes, that there's going to
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.160]   be a mass apostasy that's going to take place before the day of the Lord.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.920]   Because of apostasy, according to Scripture, sometimes it's persecution, it could be false
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:39.240]   teaching, temptation, worldliness, defective knowledge of Christ, sin, or simply drifting
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.920]   or neglecting.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.560]   That's the primary concern that the author of the book of Hebrews has in the whole book
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.040]   of Hebrews.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.680]   There is no specific mention of idolatry.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.720]   There is sexual immorality, but the primary problem with the recipients of the book of
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.200]   Hebrews is they were simply neglecting.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.520]   They were confessing Christ, but it wasn't important enough.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.200]   And they just started neglecting and drifting.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.840]   That's why the repeated command over and over again, "How shall you escape if you neglect
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.860]   such a great salvation?"
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:20.680]   So the reason why the author is focusing all his attention on the beauty of Christ is to
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.920]   get them back to focus on Christ and to stop drifting.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.320]   Paul says in 1 Timothy 4, 16, "Pay close attention to yourself and your teaching, persevering
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.720]   in these things, for as you do this, you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.040]   those who hear you."
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:44.000]   In other words, he says watch your life and your doctrine, both of it, because if you
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.560]   don't do it and you begin to slip and drift, there's consequences over salvation for life.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:59.560]   That's to say, there are some groups and some people who are very righteous in their life,
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.560]   good morals.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.880]   In fact, if you were to think of a group of people who are very committed in being moral
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:13.920]   and upright citizens, you think of maybe Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses who strive, going door
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:20.540]   to door, being persecuted and yelled at and mocked, and yet they're out there every week.
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:26.360]   Right moral, hardworking people, yet in their doctrines about who Jesus is, they become
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.200]   apostate.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.840]   And all that would have been for nothing.
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:37.680]   There are some people, and the concern that we have and where we live, is that people
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.840]   who have very good orthodox teaching.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:46.840]   If you were to ask the fundamentals of Christian faith, there are many people that surround
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:53.920]   us, that can tell us about who Jesus is, about his identity, about the Trinity, about justification,
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.480]   sanctification, glorification, yet in their life they have become apostate.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.640]   Their life looks nothing like what a Christian should live.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.200]   It looks no different than a non-Christian.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.640]   So there are people who have become apostate in doctrine, but there's also a great number
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.360]   of people who have become apostate in their right doctrine, but their life has drifted
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.800]   far away from God.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:21.640]   See the whole book of Hebrews is a book warning the church.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:27.880]   Apostasy doesn't always look like just packing up your bags and leaving and then joining
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.120]   the secular world and saying, "You know what, I'm going to worship idols, I'm going to make
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.460]   money my God."
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.880]   That's not what apostasy looks like in most cases.
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.720]   In most cases, our hearts and our life just begin to drift, and then you wake up one day
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:44.240]   realizing that maybe you don't really even believe.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:49.400]   What I want to do today and next week, we want to take a look at this text in 7 through
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.400]   11.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.720]   There are five things that I've kind of, you can divide it any way you want, but there
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:09:00.160]   are five things that I want to point out about the dangers of apostasy and how it happens.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:04.320]   Today I'm going to be dealing with two of them, and then next week I'm going to be dealing
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.320]   with the next three.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.680]   Initially I wanted to do all of it together, but I don't want to cram it all.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.480]   So today I'm going to be dealing with two of them.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:20.600]   The first two is that apostasy happens when we defer our obedience to a future date.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.560]   Apostasy happens when we defer our obedience to a future date.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:29.720]   Two, apostasy happens when we harden our hearts against God.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:35.840]   Number three, apostasy happens when we do not learn from the past mistakes.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:42.480]   Fourth, apostasy happens when our hearts begin to drift away from God and toward the world.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.840]   And then the end result of apostasy, according to scripture, is that we are not able to enter
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.280]   the rest.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.400]   So the last three part of it we're going to deal with next week, the first two we'll deal
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.400]   with this morning.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:59.440]   So the first one, apostasy happens when we defer our obedience to the future.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.920]   In verse 7 it says, "Today if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as when they
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.280]   provoked me as in the day of trial in the wilderness."
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.160]   The word "today" is repeated over and over again, not only in the book of Hebrews, but
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.120]   all throughout scripture.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.840]   He says the exact same thing, "Today if you hear his voice, do not harden your heart."
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.840]   That same phrase repeated in verse 15, chapter 4, verse 7.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.080]   Exact same phrase.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.600]   "Today if you hear his voice, do not harden your heart."
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:35.240]   Again in verse 13, he says, "Encourage one another day after day as long as it is called
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.840]   today."
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.800]   There is a sense of urgency.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.400]   There is a sense of urgency that when you hear the gospel, to respond.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.840]   When you hear the challenge or a rebuke or an encouragement, to respond immediately.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.080]   Because delayed obedience is disobedience.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.840]   If I ask one of my children, "Hey, take out the trash on Thursday."
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.480]   He says, "You know, I intend to take it out, but I'm going to take it out on Saturday."
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.520]   Saturday is useless because the trash is going to be picked up on Friday.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.200]   So he may say, he may have convinced himself, "I'm going to do it, but the trash needs to
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:17.520]   be out today, Thursday night, or else Friday, your obedience on Saturday is completely useless."
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:25.560]   When God says to obey, and he calls his people to come, and we say, we don't say no, but
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.040]   we say not now.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:32.920]   In 2 Corinthians 6, it says, "For he says, 'At the acceptable time I listened to you,
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.360]   and on the day of salvation I helped you.'
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.440]   Behold now is the acceptable time, behold now is the day of salvation."
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.400]   Why this sense of urgency?
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.640]   Why does obedience and response have to happen immediately?
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:53.720]   Because obedience that is delayed already says that there is a disobedient heart.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.280]   It is not a man, it is not a heart of surrender.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:03.560]   And what we don't recognize is that we think that revelation will always be there, that
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.400]   God's voice will always, well we have the scripture, if I don't obey today, I mean there's
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.800]   going to be another sermon next week.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.680]   If I don't like this church, there's a church down the street.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.640]   If I don't like that, I can go online.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.600]   It's just everywhere.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.160]   But there is a difference between revelation and illumination.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.400]   Illumination we have any time we want. You can wake up 3 in the morning, you can listen
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.400]   to a sermon.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.960]   If you don't like this church, you can go down the street and you can hear another sermon.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.840]   If you don't like that type of sermon, you can go to another church and hear another
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.840]   sermon.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.120]   If you don't like this pastor, you can go to the next pastor.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.440]   But there is a difference between revelation and illumination.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.480]   Revelation is the written word of God that is given that we can read and study and understand
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.000]   what it says.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.480]   Illumination is where the Holy Spirit takes the written word of God and He convicts us
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.320]   and He calls us to repentance.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.360]   Why the gospel is preached to the same group of people and certain people give their lives
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.360]   to Christ and other people harden their hearts toward God.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.940]   That's illumination.
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:07.200]   You can read the scripture, one day, same passage, but God takes that passage and He
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.400]   reveals your heart and He convicts your sins and causes you to give your life to Christ.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.440]   That's illumination.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.440]   In Isaiah chapter 55, it says, "Seek the Lord while He may be found."
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:25.000]   Meaning, you will always have revelation, but illumination is not constant.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.680]   Illumination is His kindness that leads us to repentance.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.800]   Where God is allowing you to hear His voice.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:37.560]   There's a reason why Jesus, before He preaches, says, "He who has ears, let him hear."
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.400]   He's not talking to people who are deaf.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.440]   Some people have a hard time hearing, so He says, "If you can hear me, come near."
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.920]   That's not what He's saying, obviously.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.800]   He's talking about people whose ears have been opened to the word of God.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:58.400]   As He was preaching, those who God has been gracious to open your ears to hear the truth
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:04.120]   that He is about to preach, "He who has ears, let him hear."
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:09.760]   In James chapter 4, 13-14, "Come now, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow we will go to
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:15.040]   such and such a city and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit,'
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.280]   yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow.
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.640]   You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away."
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.720]   We don't have control over tomorrow.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:32.080]   We have no idea if tomorrow you will be here.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.920]   You have no idea if you would even have the desire.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.480]   In fact, the majority of people who grew up in the church never outright say, or very
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.280]   few never outright say, "I reject Christ.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.280]   I don't believe this anymore."
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:50.160]   The majority of people who go astray from God, who become apostates, typically the response
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.920]   is, "Not now.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.560]   I got so much debt.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.880]   My children are so young.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.480]   I just started a business.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.220]   I don't have enough for retirement.
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:06.440]   When I finish my school, when I get this job, when I save enough money, if I pay my bills
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.920]   and get rid of my student loans," and there's always delay.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.840]   I'm planning to do it, but it's not a good time right now.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.400]   But what ends up happening is you have no idea.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.400]   You say, "You know what?
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.840]   Now is the time."
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.880]   And you revisit this a week later, a month later, a year later.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.880]   You don't have the desire.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:31.920]   The Word of God, same Word of God is being preached, and your heart has become hearted.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.920]   Nothing makes any sense.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.060]   Nothing is penetrating.
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.920]   Not realizing a delayed response was disobedience.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:43.200]   That's why he says, "Now, today, if you hear his voice, today, if you are convicted, today
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.040]   is the time that God calls you."
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:50.960]   God doesn't give you things today and then expects you to respond tomorrow.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.300]   Then he'll, he wouldn't talk to you tomorrow.
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:16:00.520]   If he's preaching today, if he's calling you today, he says, "Today, now is the time."
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:09.120]   Luke 17, 27-30 is describing the end times and what the world would be like when he comes.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.160]   They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:19.180]   until the day that Noah entered the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all.
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.440]   It was the same that has happened in the days of Lot.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.480]   They were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:30.720]   planting, they were building, but on the day of the Lord, when out from Sodom, it rained
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.480]   fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:38.880]   So it will be just the same on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:45.120]   Do you notice the warning that is given about the coming of Christ and judgment that is
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.800]   coming, that the life that's described, and there's idolatry, there's murder, there's
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.360]   coveting, there's lying, there's slander.
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.140]   He doesn't mention that.
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:17:00.160]   He says they're going to be marrying, they're going to be drinking, they're going to be
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.800]   eating, they're going to be building, they're going to be selling.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.740]   It's just normal life.
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.580]   It's going to be like everybody else in this world.
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:13.040]   They're going to go to school, they're going to get married, have kids, pay their bills,
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:18.800]   put some money in retirement, live a nice, comfortable life, and all of a sudden, bam,
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.920]   the judgment is going to come, like a thief in the night, like birth pains of a pregnant
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.320]   woman that's going to come suddenly, and all of a sudden, everything in your life is going
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.440]   to change.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:39.760]   Where you and I live, the greatest danger is the chasing of the American dream.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.920]   That is the greatest deception, that is the greatest drain of our spiritual lives.
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.640]   It is not pursuit of idolatry.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:51.680]   Yes, many people struggle with pornography, and that is an issue.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:59.640]   But overall, the greatest thing that is sucking the church dry is this desire to have a taste
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.080]   of the American dream, where we are constantly fed.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:09.880]   We live in a great country where we are able to pursue life, liberty, and happiness.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.640]   And in and of itself, how can that be sinful?
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.420]   How can that be dangerous?
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:22.900]   Because if we're not careful, and if we're not sober, it is the pursuit of what is good,
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:28.980]   the pursuit of what is good that causes us to forfeit what is the best.
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.760]   And that is our constant, constant danger.
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:38.440]   We know the distinguished marks between chasing after the world and chasing after God.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.120]   We know that.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.620]   But the temptation is, what's so wrong with focusing my energy on my children?
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.100]   What's so wrong about putting money away in retirement?
[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.940]   What's so wrong about moving up ahead in life?
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.740]   And none of that, in and of itself, is wrong.
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:57.620]   But the Bible says, at the end times, before judgment comes, our life, the life of the
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.540]   world is going to look exactly like anybody else.
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:03.700]   They're just going to live as if they're going to go on forever before judgment comes.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:08.180]   That's why Paul says in 2 Thessalonians 3.1, "Finally, brethren, pray for us that the word
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:12.500]   of the Lord will spread rapidly and be glorified."
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.900]   Why does he pray for rapid spread?
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:20.420]   He's not satisfied with just doing his part.
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.180]   And he's the one who says, "I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.180]   may be saved."
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:29.220]   He teaches us about predestination, about election, about adoption.
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.980]   Why is there such an urgency to get the gospel out?
[00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.180]   Because tomorrow, he doesn't know if he's going to be there.
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:42.140]   He doesn't know for his generation, for those people at that time, God has called him to
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.300]   be, to share the gospel.
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:50.140]   There was a sense of urgency in his heart for the salvation of the lost.
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:20:04.620]   But today, and again, our greatest life sucker, our greatest killer of joy, killer of life,
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.300]   there are many things.
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:12.500]   But the primary thing is this false pursuit of things that we think are going to make
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.860]   us happy.
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:18.220]   And all it does is lead to frustration and destruction.
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:24.380]   That's why he says today, it is his kindness that leads us to repentance.
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:30.320]   If you hear the word of God, and it makes any sense to you, that wasn't you.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.100]   If you're sitting there basically saying, "Okay, you know, I got nothing to gain from
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.100]   this."
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.100]   Right?
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:40.660]   If you're sitting there and the word of God is convicting you in any bit, the Bible says,
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.660]   it's his kindness that has caused you to be there.
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:49.540]   He opened your ears, he softened your heart, he caused you to see.
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.020]   It's his kindness that leads you to repentance.
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:57.640]   And when God calls you to repentance, and you say, "Not now.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.640]   What about this?
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.700]   And what about that?"
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.440]   And the reason why this is so important is the next thing.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.940]   Mercy begins by delaying obedience, but when we delay our obedience, the second thing happens.
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.000]   They harden their hearts toward God.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.920]   They harden their hearts toward God.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:20.000]   In the book of Revelations, chapter 2, the warning against the church of Ephesus, though
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.380]   they were religiously very upright people, he says, "I have this against you, that you
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.280]   have forsaken your first love."
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:34.560]   You know, the dangerous thing in our culture is we automatically assume that if you've
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:39.340]   been a Christian for a while, and the longer you've been a Christian, that your fire has
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.200]   already died.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.160]   If you're a young Christian on fire, you give testimony, we assume that, "Oh, you're new.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.160]   You're in a honeymoon stage."
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.160]   Right?
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.440]   And that's what we think about marriage, too.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.120]   You know, it's like, the people who are the most excited about their marriage are the
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.120]   ones who just got married.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.800]   And if you've been married for 10 years, less.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.560]   20 years, even less.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.280]   30 years, ball and chains.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.280]   Right?
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.200]   Or, "I've got to train this monkey to do dishes."
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.760]   Like, that's the way we talk, because we think that if you've been married for a long period
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:13.620]   of time, your love has died, and you're just persevering, and that's sad.
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.160]   But that's the way people think.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.080]   That's not what God intended.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:21.080]   But sad thing is, that's applied even to our walk with God.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.080]   When people are on fire, it's like, "Oh, when did you get saved?"
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.080]   "Oh, last week I got saved."
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.080]   It's like, "Yeah, that's great."
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.080]   You know?
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.600]   If somebody's been a Christian for 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, you just automatically
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.320]   assume that you're jaded.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.320]   Right?
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.480]   You're cynical.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.840]   You know, you're just kind of in the back, just watching.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:44.160]   Sad to say, the reason why that perspective is true is because, observably, it is true.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.240]   That's not what God intended.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.680]   The Bible says that we didn't...
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:53.560]   In Revelation chapter 2, it doesn't say, "You've lost your first love," as if we were carrying
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.760]   something, and it just slipped through our fingers, and we had a hole in our pocket,
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.760]   and we lost it.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.200]   That's not how it's described.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.160]   The Bible says, "You have forsaken.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.160]   You have left.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.840]   You have abandoned your first love."
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.360]   He says, he didn't say, "Don't let your heart be hardened."
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.920]   He says, "Do not harden your heart."
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.360]   It's first degree.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.400]   It's with intent.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.120]   You know exactly where this is going, and you chose it anyway.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:28.240]   If we delay our obedience, a year later, you're not going to be in the same place.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.640]   Our faith is living and active, just like the Word of God.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:39.040]   So the stream that you stand in, that is moving, five minutes later is not the same stream.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.920]   So when God calls you, and you say, "You know what?
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.420]   Maybe after a little bit, maybe when our kids are a little bit older, maybe when the bills
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:52.240]   are paid, and the Word of God comes, your heart is not in the same place anymore."
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.800]   And you're wondering, "How did I get here?
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.240]   I used to sing these songs, and it used to move me and convict me.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.240]   I used to come to the Bible study.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.680]   I used to love the study of the Word of God.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.920]   I used to love the fellowship, but what happened?"
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.480]   God's call cannot be turned on and off.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:13.640]   You may have revelation anytime you want, but illumination is by the kindness of God.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.980]   That's why He says, "Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your heart.
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:21.920]   Do not deliberately harden your heart."
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:26.120]   In Isaiah 64, verse 8, it says, "God is the potter, and we are the clay."
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:30.320]   And the illustration is that God is the one who is molding us, and as clay, we need to
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.080]   be moldable.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:36.820]   And that's why God continues to call the nation of Israel being stiff-necked.
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:40.480]   Stiff-necked is somebody who is stiff and will not yield, will not bend.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.800]   He was not going to be molded.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:49.320]   I don't know how many of you have experience in making pottery.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:53.400]   I don't, but I have some experience in working with cement.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:25:00.360]   Cement, you add water, you know, and you pour it wherever, whatever it is that you are cementing,
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.040]   you have a limited time window.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.040]   If you make a mistake and it's lumpy, you can't come back the next day and then say,
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.360]   "Okay, let me fix, smooth this out."
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.360]   You can't.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.540]   When the water hardens, it's useless.
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:16.000]   So if it's not formed the way you want, you have to break it up and throw it away.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.560]   It's useless.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:22.640]   So that period where you pour the water and it's moldable, that's the time where you need
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.640]   to make it straight.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.380]   That's the time you need to mold it the way that you desire.
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.640]   And that's what the Word of God says.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:33.800]   When the Word of God is taught and you are convicted, and you say, "Man, I really need
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.880]   to do this.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.040]   God really convicted me."
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.200]   And then the next statement is, "Not today, tomorrow."
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:45.320]   But the problem is tomorrow doesn't come.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.280]   And when you say, "I'm ready now, God.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.120]   Where are you?"
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:55.280]   The Bible says in the book of Amos, the prophet goes to a nation of Israel who was hyper-religious
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.880]   during that period of time, and yet they were committing all kinds of sins before God, and
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.960]   yet they were making all these sacrifices.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.840]   And God kept on calling them, calling them, sending prophet after prophet, and they would
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.800]   not listen.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:12.440]   And as a final judgment to the nation of Israel, at the end of the book of Amos, he says, "A
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:17.360]   famine is going to come, but not a famine of rain or of food or of harvest, but the
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.960]   famine of the Word of God."
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:24.360]   That they're going to be staggering from place to place, wanting to hear from God, but it
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.600]   will not be given.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:32.560]   In other words, the opportunity for you to hear and repent has come, but now it is gone.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:37.360]   That's why I said, "Today, do not harden your heart."
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.160]   Verse 8 and 9, "Do not harden your hearts as when they provoked me, as in the day of
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:46.160]   trial in the wilderness, where your fathers tried me by testimony and saw my works for
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.280]   forty years."
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:52.520]   This is a direct quote from Psalm 95, 7 through 9.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:57.880]   You know what's interesting is, David is writing this Psalm, in Psalm 95, dealing with the
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:03.800]   same problem that the author of Hebrews is dealing with the problem 2,000 years ago.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:09.960]   The event that David is referring to happened 400 years before he writes Psalm 95.
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:16.680]   So that particular event that they are referring to is repeated all over Scripture as an example
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.440]   of the apostasy of the nation of Israel.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.240]   And I'm going to show you that.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.320]   I'm going to give you some verses.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:30.640]   I mean, it must have been some horrendous sin that all throughout Scripture, that this
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:35.800]   becomes the example of Israel's rebellion against God.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.160]   The text that they are referring to, or the event that is referring to, is located in
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.800]   Exodus chapter 17, 1 through 7.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.920]   And this is the event that David is referring to, and this is the event that the author
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.000]   of Hebrews is referring to.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.960]   Now normally I don't like to read long texts, but I think we need to understand the context
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:28:02.640]   of this verse, because this is used as a primary example of warning of what not to do.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.640]   So let me read that with you.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.560]   So follow along as I read this.
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.200]   Then all the congregation of the sons of Israel journeyed by stages from the wilderness of
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:15.440]   sin according to the command of the Lord and camped at Rephidim, and there was no water
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.720]   for the people to drink.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:22.000]   Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, "Give us water that we may drink."
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.440]   And Moses said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me?
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.440]   Why do you test the Lord?"
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:30.920]   But the people thirsted there for water, and they grumbled against Moses and said, "Why
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:36.120]   now have you brought us up from Egypt to kill us and our children and our livestock with
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.760]   thirst?"
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.240]   Stop right there.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:48.840]   Of all the examples, of all the examples that can be given about the rebellion and stiff-neckedness
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:55.040]   of Israel, what is mentioned here is innocuous.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:01.040]   I mean, of all the things that you can talk about, about the rebellion of Israel, they
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:05.400]   were thirsty and they said, "Give me some water."
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:11.040]   I mean, the whole book of Psalms is about crying out to God.
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.040]   Why?
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.040]   What are you, God?
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.160]   And how come the unrighteous are prospering?
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.160]   What are you going to do with my enemies?
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.560]   And the whole book of Psalms is complaining.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.800]   Not all of it, but a big chunk of it.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.880]   So what is it about the nation of Israel?
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:31.240]   What is it that they were doing that is being used as a primary example of Israel's rebellion
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.480]   against God?
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:37.800]   Verse 4, "So Moses cried out to the Lord, saying, 'What shall I do to these people?
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.640]   A little more, they will stone me.'
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.560]   Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Pass before the people and take with you some of the elders
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:48.840]   of Israel, and take in your hands your staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:53.400]   Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb, and you shall strike the rock,
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.960]   and there will come out of it that the people may drink.'
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.860]   And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:05.760]   He named the place Masah and Merjbah, which literally means to test or to quarrel with
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.760]   God.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.440]   This is because of the quarrel of the sons of Israel, because of the test of the Lord,
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.640]   saying, 'Is the Lord among us or not?'"
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.280]   Let's dig a little bit further, what he says.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.240]   Hebrews chapter 3, 8-9 was a direct quote from Psalm 95.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:26.920]   He says, "As in the day of trial in the wilderness where your fathers tried me by testing me."
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:33.160]   You notice that in this basically same sentence, the word trial and tested is mentioned three
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.920]   separate times.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:40.120]   The first two are from the same root word, and it is neither positive or negative.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:44.920]   It's just like when you test something to prove something, to see the quality of something.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.320]   That's the word that is used here, to try or to test.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:53.700]   The word for testing is a different word, but again, it is not neither positive or negative,
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:57.400]   but it is used negatively in this text.
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:01.760]   Now all of that is just kind of a setup to help us understand this text.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:07.500]   What he is saying here, what David is saying, and it is quoted by this passage, is God was
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:13.800]   bringing the nation of Israel through the wilderness to prove them, to test them.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:19.320]   Just like it says in the book of James, "Consider it pure joy when you face trials of many kinds."
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:24.080]   That God is using that to prove the genuineness of your faith.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:29.940]   He says that's what God was doing to the nation of Israel, but what did they do?
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:35.840]   They took that proving, turned it around, and they tested God.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:41.400]   They turned it around saying, "And here's where the problem lies."
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:46.040]   It's not simply that they were thirsty and saying, "God, where is this water?"
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.800]   In verse 7, what does it say?
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:53.160]   They tested him, "And is the Lord among us or not?"
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:32:00.180]   They were testing God and saying, "If you are real, if you are really among us, why
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.700]   don't you give us the water?"
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.220]   So God was causing them or proving their faith.
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:09.640]   They turned it around and they began to point finger at God.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:13.400]   Why are you doing this to us?
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.680]   On the surface superficially, it looks innocuous.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.440]   It looks innocent.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.120]   Who wouldn't be complaining if you have young children and they are not able to drink water?
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.280]   Why wouldn't they say, "God, we need water.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.280]   Help us."
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:33.000]   The whole book of Psalm is a pleading before God before that.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.680]   But their sin and their rebellion was they look at their circumstance and when they were
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:43.720]   squeezed, what came out was rebellion.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:47.140]   When they were squeezed, what came out was unbelief.
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.320]   And that's what he is referring to, that they were stiff-necked.
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:55.480]   In Deuteronomy 6, verse 14, it says, "You should not put the Lord your God to the test,
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:58.640]   as you tested him at Massa."
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.880]   Repeatedly over and over again.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:04.480]   Luke chapter 4, verse 12, when Jesus is being tested, he answered in quoting that passage,
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.480]   it is said, "You should not put the Lord your God to the test, as you tested him at
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.480]   Massa."
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:10.580]   And then they turned the tables around and say, "Why are you doing this to me?"
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:18.040]   And what was revealed when they got squeezed was what they valued.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.400]   They weren't following God.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.000]   They were demanding that God follow them.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.400]   And when God didn't give them what they wanted, they questioned him.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.840]   Where are you?
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.600]   Do you see the danger and how dangerous this is?
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:41.980]   That on the surface it looks very innocent, but behind that God saw apostasy.
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:47.340]   And why that is used over and over and over and over again as an example that we do not
[00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:51.400]   fall into the same sin.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.720]   While they were drinking, while they were marrying, while they were eating, while they
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:34:01.080]   were buying, while they were selling, the judgment came.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.760]   That is the danger of where you and I live.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:11.260]   Because the sins of us drifting away from God, it seems innocuous.
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:18.040]   And everything seems okay until trials come and then it reveals what you really value.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.340]   We weren't following Christ at all.
[00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:25.480]   We were committed to the same things we were committed before we became Christian, but
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:29.500]   now we have Jesus' help.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:37.740]   Their hearts became so hardened that they no longer recognized God as God.
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:44.160]   You know, this week I was reading an article that was so ridiculous.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:47.720]   And it's just amazing to me how somebody could fall away this far.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.840]   You know the show Bachelorette?
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.940]   Don't nod your head because I don't want to hear it.
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.600]   I've never watched the show, but I understand the premise.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:01.280]   You know, they choose a pretty girl, they get ten decent looking guys, and then she's
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:04.020]   supposed to choose one of them, right?
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:08.920]   And in that process, there's a lot of sexual activity that takes place, at least according
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.560]   to the article.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:15.200]   But the reason why this made the news was because this one young lady, and I forgot
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:20.000]   her name, was professing to be a practicing Christian.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.240]   And there's rumors that were going around that in the context of choosing which bachelor
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:29.000]   that she was going to choose, that she was sleeping around with different guys.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.680]   So they asked her, "How are you able to do what you're doing as a professing Christian?"
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.520]   And this is an exact quote.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.840]   "I can do whatever.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:44.360]   I sin daily and Jesus still loves me."
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.280]   That's an exact quote that I copied.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.960]   "I can do whatever.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:53.800]   I sin daily and Jesus still loves me."
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.680]   Christ is not our Lord.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:02.040]   Christ is being used to help her with whatever it is that she is pursuing.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.880]   And if we're not careful, if we're not paying attention, we're not sober, we can easily
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.960]   fall into that same sin.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.960]   Sins that are obvious.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:15.520]   I mean, if you're struggling with pornography, no one's going to fight against that.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:16.520]   "I'm struggling with that."
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.520]   And you're seeking help, you're getting counseling.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.300]   We know what it is.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.800]   We know when idolatry is clear.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.680]   We know when you're coveting and slandering and it is sinful before God.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.680]   We know that.
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.840]   And so we combat that.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:34.480]   But the most dangerous sins are the sins that we have compromised and we've allowed and
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.160]   we've justified.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.720]   And it allows us to slowly drift away from God.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.640]   And next thing you know, you're nowhere near God.
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.960]   And you can say something like this without blinking an eye.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.640]   On national television, "I can do whatever.
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.760]   I sin daily and Jesus still loves me."
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:57.980]   There's a reason why Exodus chapter 17, 1 through 7 is used as a primary example of
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:01.200]   all the sins that Israel committed.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:09.080]   I mean, Israel at one point in their history, sacrificed their children.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:13.320]   Like open idolatry, Asherah worship, Baal worship.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.320]   They defiled the temple with false idols.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:21.500]   I mean, consider all the sins that they committed that the author and David could have chosen
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.240]   to say, "Do not be like the nation of Israel.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.840]   Do not make child sacrifices.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:28.840]   Do not murder.
[00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:29.840]   Do not commit adultery."
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:33.640]   But that's not what he chooses as a primary example of their rebellion.
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:39.720]   So when they got squeezed, they turned their finger toward God.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.360]   Where are you?
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.400]   It revealed what they value.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:48.860]   Hebrews chapter 3, 8 to 9.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:54.380]   Matthew chapter 13, 14, 16 says, "In their case, the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled,
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:58.620]   which says, 'You will keep on hearing, but will not understand.
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:01.540]   You will keep on seeing, but will not perceive.
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.580]   For the heart of this people has become dull.
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:09.140]   With their ears they scarcely hear, and they have closed their eyes, otherwise they would
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:14.820]   see their eyes, hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and return, and
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.600]   I would heal them.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.180]   But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear."
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:27.100]   Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your heart.
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:32.580]   It is the kindness of God that leads us to repentance.
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.860]   There may be no tomorrow.
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:39.620]   When your children are grown up, not only will your hearts be hardened, so will your
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:42.100]   children.
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:45.340]   Religious activity does not raise up godly children.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.420]   They just become religious people.
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:52.580]   Religious people are the hardest people to reach with the gospel because they think they
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.100]   know because they memorize scripture.
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:58.060]   I shared with you last week, if you asked me before I became a Christian, "What do
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.220]   I believe about Jesus?"
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:03.300]   I would have given you an orthodox answer because I memorized scripture.
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:09.500]   Because I went to VBS, I never missed church, but I had no idea who Jesus was.
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:14.940]   If we delay obedience, in God's eyes, it's disobedience.
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:21.140]   And we are hardening our heart to the point where we wake up one day and the word of God
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:24.980]   makes no sense to you.
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:31.420]   And it sounds like nothing more than instructions on building IKEA furniture that you have no
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.660]   intention to build.
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.620]   It's just information.
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:39.900]   Let me conclude with this challenge.
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:43.620]   A rhetorical question.
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:51.660]   If you gave all your life to Christ today, how will your life be different?
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:58.780]   If you gave all of it and Christ was Lord of all of your life, how will it change your
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:00.980]   future?
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:04.040]   How will it change the way you handle finances?
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:12.380]   How will it change the way you choose who you marry, where you work, what you pursue?
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:15.380]   Obviously that's a rhetorical question.
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:21.220]   But if you think to yourself, "Man, if I really gave my life, it would be this different."
[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:28.860]   Then the next question is, "Then haven't you delayed obedience?"
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.180]   You didn't say no.
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:37.500]   You know that God is speaking to you in certain areas of your life.
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:41.400]   You know that that's something that God wants you to surrender.
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:46.180]   And you don't say no, you just say not now.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:52.580]   Some of you are sitting here with your hearts so hardened that all you can think about is
[00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:55.620]   get over with it.
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.220]   I pray that that's not the case.
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:03.420]   That most of you, that your hearts have become soft enough that when you hear His voice that
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:06.820]   you would respond, that you would not harden your heart.
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:10.900]   That it is the kindness of God, the fact that you're sitting here and listening, and if
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:14.500]   you're convicted even a little bit, that that wasn't you.
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.700]   You didn't wake up this morning and say, "I'm going to have a soft heart.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.340]   I'm going to open my ears so that I can hear."
[00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:23.660]   God, in His grace, allowed you to be here and hear His Word.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:26.860]   And for you to understand even a bit of it, it's because of His kindness that is leading
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:27.860]   you to repentance.
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:34.540]   And if you say not now, you will leave this room with a hardened heart, and next week
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.540]   it will be harder.
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:38.140]   Next week it will be even harder than that.
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:44.700]   And that is why He says today, today, not tomorrow, not tonight, today, if you hear
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:49.020]   His voice, do not harden your heart.
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:54.300]   Let me ask our worship team to come and take some time to lead us in prayer.
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.480]   Don't think about other people.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.780]   Don't think about other situations.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:02.740]   If you have caught yourself in your heart, you've been wrapped up in your studies, in
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:07.660]   your goals, in your family, relationships, whatever it may have been, but your heart
[00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:13.700]   has become so hardened that the Word of God is no longer penetrating, take some time to
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.860]   come before the Lord.
[00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:18.100]   "Lord, help me.
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:23.140]   Open my ears that I may hear, that I may follow my Savior."
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.940]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:26.940]   [music]
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.940]   [music]
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.940]   [music]
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:32.940]   [music]
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:34.940]   [music]
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.940]   [music]
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.940]   [music]
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.940]   [music]
