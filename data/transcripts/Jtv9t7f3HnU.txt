[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Oh my soul, oh my soul, worship His holy name.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Sing like never before, oh my soul, I worship Your holy name.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   It's time to sing Your song again.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Let me be singing when the evening comes.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul, worship His holy name.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Sing like never before, oh my soul, I worship Your holy name.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   We're rich in love, we're rich in love, and we're slow to anger.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Your name is great and Your heart is kind.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   For all Your goodness I will keep on singing.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Oh bless the Lord.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul, worship His holy name.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Sing like never before, oh my soul, I worship Your holy name.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And on that day, and on that day when my strength is failing,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   The end draws near and my time has come.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Still my soul will sing Your praise unending.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Two thousand years and then forevermore.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Oh bless the Lord.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul, worship His holy name.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Sing like never before, oh my soul, I worship Your holy name.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Bless the Lord, oh my soul, oh my soul, worship His holy name.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Sing like never before, oh my soul, I worship Your holy name.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I will worship Your holy name.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Again, welcome to Berean Community Church, those of you who are here and online.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   We have a few announcements before we get started.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   First of all, our members meeting is happening today at 2.30pm.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   So those of you who are members and those of you who are going to be introduced to membership today,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   please be prompt at 2.30.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   So if you didn't get a Zoom address to come in,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Pastor Mark Lim is going to give that to you.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   So if you can't find it, please contact him ASAP.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And if you can't make it, please let him know also.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Today is the beginning of the year where we re-signed the covenant.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   So you should have gotten an email asking you to go through and to evaluate the covenant
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   and to sign it and turn it in.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   So if you haven't done so, we ask you to do that, hopefully, before you come to the meeting.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And so that, again, at 2.30 sharp, we're going to be able to do that
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   and expect to be in the room for about an hour.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Starting from this week, we said that watch and pray is going to be the theme of this year.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And so that's why we're implementing morning prayer to come a little bit early
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   and take some time to pray before the worship starts.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Starting from this Wednesday, the church is going to be open from 7.30 to 8.30 a.m.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   So those of you who want to physically be here to participate in time of prayer,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   the sanctuary is going to be open, and you can come and take some time to pray,
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   pray with other brothers and sisters.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   So that's going to happen on Wednesdays.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And then there will be other prayer meetings that are going on.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   The Tuesday prayer meeting for the college students will also continue to go on.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And so please watch out for that.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   There's going to be more opportunities for us to get together to take some time to pray.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   So we don't want this to just be the theme that we have in the background,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   but we want to actively pursue to build a church that really seeks God in prayer.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   So please keep that in mind in your prayer.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Along with that, on January 29th at 7.30 p.m., we are having a praise and prayer night.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Again, it will be indoor and outdoor in order to kind of distance ourselves.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And if you are planning to come, just go to the app and just kind of say that you're coming
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   so that we can know how many people are coming for that.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   And then our second round, or for second Thessalonians Bible study,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   it's going to be starting the first week of February.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   And so people have been asking if we're going to be able to get together live.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   And, again, considering all that's going on, we're going to probably just keep a status quo for now.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   So if we look at the numbers and see what's going on around us and what the government is saying,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   if it looks like we're able to, we may change that going forward.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   But at least for the opening part of it, we're letting you know that we'll most likely continue what's going on.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   We will be having it on Zoom and online, unless your small group is making specific accommodations for that group.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Okay, so just keep that in mind.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   And I think that's it for the announcements for today.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   All right, so we'll give a few minutes for us to take some time for our offering.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And then, again, if you have a physical offering, it will be in the back box over there.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Okay, let's pray.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for just watching over us, persevering with us.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Things that we are aware of and things that we are not aware of.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Lord, you are our God, and we want to worship you.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   We want to worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Lord, search us and know us and see if there's any hurtful ways in us.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   If we've brought into this worship, Lord, anything that distracts us,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   any entanglement that causes us, Lord God, to drift from you,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   help us through this service to be reminded of who you are,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   that our eyes may be opened again, that our hearts, Lord, may be softened again,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   that we will continue to follow you and honor you with all our hearts.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   So we pray that even in our giving, help us to give cheerfully, joyfully, abundantly, Lord,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   and may it be multiplied for your use.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   [music]
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   [music]
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   [music]
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   [music]
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   [music]
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   [music]
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   [music]
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   [music]
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Church family, let's all rise together as we sing before God.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   [music]
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   [music]
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   The truth and light, the fire.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   The truth and light, the fire of a thousand burning suns
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   blazing in the heavens.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   There is only one, He is our God.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Who commands the nations, who commands the nations
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   building up and tearing down,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   silence in His right hand.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   There is only one, He is our God.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Let's sing.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   He is our God.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Holy,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   you alone are holy.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Last to sin your glory.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Holy God.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   [music]
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   You come to save us.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   You come to save us when we turn to Him as love.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Offer us with kindness.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   There is only one, He is our God.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Sing it out, He is our God.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   He is our God.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Holy,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   you alone are holy.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Last to sin your glory.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   No one is like you.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   You alone are worthy.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   We adore you, Holy,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Holy God.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Now to the King on the throne,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   who was and is to come,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   and to the Lamb who was slain,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   glory.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Now to the King on the throne,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   who was and is to come,
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   and to the Lamb who was slain,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   glory.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Now to the King on the throne,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   who was and is to come,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   and to the Lamb who was slain,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   glory.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Holy,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   you alone are holy.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Last to sin your glory.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   No one is like you.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   You alone are worthy.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   We adore you, Holy,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Holy God.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   [Instrumental]
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Come from a foundation,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   ye saints of the Lord,
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   who is laid for your faith
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   in His excellent Word.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   What more can He say
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   than to you He has said,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   to you who for refuge
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   to Jesus have fled.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   [Instrumental]
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Fear not, I am with thee,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   O be not dismayed,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   for I am thy God
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   and will still be thee.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   I'll strengthen thee,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   help thee,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   and cause thee to stand
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   on a path by my right.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Chaste, omnipotent Lord.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   [Instrumental]
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   When through the deep waters
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   I call thee to go,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   the rivers of song
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   will shall not overflow,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   for I will be with thee.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Thy troubles to be seen,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   and sanctify to thee
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   thy deepest distress.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   [Instrumental]
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   When through fiery trials
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   thy pathway shall lie,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   my grace of salvation
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   shall be thy supply.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   The flame shall not hurt thee,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   I only desire
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   that I trust to conceive
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   and thy goal to revive.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   The soul that on Jesus
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   has laid for reproof,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   I will not, I will not
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   desert you, it's true.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   That soul, though not pure,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   should endeavor to shoot.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   I'll never, no never,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   no never be slow.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   That soul, though hollow,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   should endeavor to shoot.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   I'll never, no never,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   no never be slow.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   [Instrumental]
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Amen.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   [Instrumental]
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   What gift of grace
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   is Jesus my Redeemer?
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   There is no more
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   for heaven now to give.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   He is my joy,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   my righteousness and freedom,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   my steadfast love,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   my deep and boundless peace.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   To this I hold,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   my hope is only Jesus,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   for my life is wholly bound to His.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Oh, how strange and divine,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   like in sin all is mine,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   yet not I, but through Christ in heaven.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   [Instrumental]
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   The night is dark,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   but I am not forsaken,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   for by my side
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   the Savior here will stay.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   I'll labor on
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   in weakness and rejoice,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   for in my name
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   His power is displayed.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   To this I hold,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   my shepherd will defend me,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   through the deepest valley He will lead.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Oh, that my heart's been won
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   and I shall overcome,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   yet not I, but through Christ in heaven.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   [Instrumental]
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   No fate,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   no fate I dread,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   I know I am forgiven.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   The future's sure,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   the price it has been paid,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   for Jesus bled
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   and suffered for my heart.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   And He was raised
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   to overthrow the demons.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   To this I hold,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   my sin has been defeated,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Jesus now and ever is mine.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Oh, the chains I release,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   but you see,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   I am free, yet not I,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   but through Christ in heaven.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   [Instrumental]
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   With every breath,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   with every breath,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   I long to follow Jesus,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   for He has said
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   that He will bring me home.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   And day by day,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   I know He will renew me,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   for I still I stand
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   with joy for His love.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   To this I hold,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   my hope is only Jesus,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   all the glory ever was to me.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   When the beast is beaten,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   his divine face
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   shall be me,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   yet not I,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   but through Christ in heaven.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   To this I hold,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   my hope is only Jesus,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   all the glory ever was to me.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   When the beast is come,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   his divine face
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   shall be me,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   yet not I,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   but through Christ in heaven.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   When the beast is come,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   his divine face
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   shall be me,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   yet not I,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   but through Christ in heaven.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Yet not I,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   but through Christ in heaven.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Yet not I,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   but through Christ in heaven.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Amen.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   If you can turn your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   We're continuing on the series on the heroes of faith in Hebrews chapter 11.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   I'm going to be reading from verse 20 through 22.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   But my main text, we're just going to be on one verse today.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Hebrews chapter 11, verse 20 through 22.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   even regarding things to come.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   By faith Jacob, as he was dying,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshipped,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   leaning on the top of his staff.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   By faith Joseph, when he was dying,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   and gave orders concerning his bones.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Let's pray.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your grace.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   We pray for your guidance.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   We pray for your Holy Spirit to continue to speak to us.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Lord, we know that the exposition of your word, Lord,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   will only allow us, Lord, to understand mentally
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   if your Holy Spirit doesn't illumine us.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   So search us, Lord God.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Search our hearts, our thoughts, our motives.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   May it be surrendered to your word this morning.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   All right, so when I started the sermon,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   I was planning to cover the three verses.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   My goal is not to go one verse a week.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   But the three verses that we're looking at
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   covers the history in Genesis, almost 40 chapters.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   And so I could just kind of skim over and say,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   this is what faith looks like,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   and these are some examples of that.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Or I can just kind of dive in
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   and review over what's going on in Genesis.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Obviously I've chosen to do the latter.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And I think it's beneficial for us to understand
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   the historical context in which this is going on.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   And so the text that we're looking at,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   it really is covering over about two and a half chapters.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   And then the other two men that are mentioned,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Jacob and Joseph,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   they're going to be covering about 12 to 13 chapters each.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   But I think it would be beneficial for us
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   to know what's going on in Genesis.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   So when he says, "By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau,"
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   regarding things to come,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   that's what he's talking about, right?
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   So instead of just assuming you know the story,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   I think it would be good for us to review it,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   and it'll help us to understand better
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   why he says what he says.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Right off the bat, we're looking at verse 20,
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   "By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau,"
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   even regarding things to come.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   That verse, if you just skim through it
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   and you didn't ask any questions, that's enough,
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   because it's consistent with everything else
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   he's saying in chapter 11.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   But if you've ever read through
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   the history of what's going on
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   behind this verse,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   it causes us to take a step back and question.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Isaac was involved in probably
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   one of the greatest highlights
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   in the redemptive history,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   where the sacrifice and then saving him from that
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   was a type of what Christ was going to do.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   And we saw the Father's heart
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   through Abraham and the things that he was going through,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   and all of that to point to us, to strike in us
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   about what God himself was going to do with his own son.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   And Isaac was the recipient of that.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   He was not a young child.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Most people think he could be as young as 14 or 15
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   or as old as 20.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   So he wasn't a little kid where he didn't understand
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   what was going on.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   And that same guy, you would expect
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   that after that great event,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   his life would be kind of,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   he takes the baton, and then
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   his faith grows even further than that,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   and then he's able to do even greater things than Abraham
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   because he had the benefit
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   of a godly father who went through
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   all that he went through, and then just
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   passed it on to his son.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Instead, it causes us to look at
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Isaac plus Jacob.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   If you know anything behind that story,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   it's like, "What?"
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   All of redemptive history happened like that?
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And again, we'll review what is happening here,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   but I think it's important for us to uncover
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   that we don't look at something,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   especially in the Bible, that we don't fully understand
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   and we say, "Well, you know, we trust God."
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   That's good. We should trust God.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   Right?
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   But why did God allow this to happen?
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Why does something so important
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   as a line in which redemptive history
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   was going to come down, come through trickery,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   lying, deception?
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Maybe even we might say it was unjust
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   to take that away from Esau.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Why did God allow that?
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   And why is that event
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   described in this verse
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   that, "By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob"?
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   What did faith have to do with that?
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   You know, we could say,
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   "By trickery, Isaac blessed Jacob."
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   Right?
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Isaac was deceived to bless Jacob.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   Through Jacob's lying and conniving,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   he received a blessing.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Through a simple mistake of Esau,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   he forsook his blessing.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   But by faith?
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   What does faith have to do with any of this?
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Right?
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   So we want to examine this morning
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   what this actually means and try to uncover that.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   And so I'm just going to tell you ahead of time.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   We're going to spend our time in chapter 25-27
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   just going over the narrative
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   so that we can better understand the story
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   behind this statement.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   And then my main point is going to be at the end.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   I'm going to try to summarize what's going on
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   and why this is stated in verse 20
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   at the tail end of the message.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Okay? So first part of it, we want to go over
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   what's going on.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   As I said, Isaac was just involved.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Right? At least in Genesis.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   He was just involved in probably the greatest
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   redemptive point where it's so clear
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   what God was doing through him.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   And then he survives that, Jehovah-Jireh,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   saying that God the Father is going to provide.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   So again, you would think that the next event
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   that we hear is Isaac with his great faith
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   continue to grow even further than Abraham.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Instead, Isaac is described to us
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   very plainly. Right?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   I mean, it doesn't say he was Kenobi.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   It doesn't say anything, but he was just like
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   his dad when he was young.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   You know, he meets his wife and then he's
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   sojourning in foreign lands and
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   he runs into a greater nation,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   the Philistines, and he's afraid
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   just like his dad.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   And when he meets King Abed-Millah, he said,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   "Tell them that you're my sister
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   instead of my wife."
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Same thing that his dad did.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Because if they find out,
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   because you're so pretty, that they're going to come
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   and kill me to get you.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   So again, he does the same thing.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   Again, the same problem that his dad had
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   when he was young.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   But really, the whole story of Isaac
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   really centers on his blessing on Jacob.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   There's not a whole lot written about him.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   And in the redemptive history,
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   that's his highlight at the end of his life.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   So at the tail end of Abraham's life,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   he has great faith,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   sacrificing his only son,
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   believing that God can raise him from the dead.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   But here's Isaac at the end of his life,
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   he's being tricked.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   In humans' point of view,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   he's blessing the wrong person.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   So let's take a closer look.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   In Genesis 25, 27-34,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   this is how this is introduced to us.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   When the boys grew up,
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   the twins Jacob and Esau,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   Esau became a skillful hunter,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   a man of the field.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   But Jacob was a peaceful man,
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   a man of great intention.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Now, let's first see who these guys are.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   These guys are twins.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   And the older brother, Esau,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   he's the manly man.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   He's the guy who hunts.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   He's the skillful hunter.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Jacob was peaceful.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   And that word "peaceful" is very important
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   because that's how Jacob is described to us,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   this man of faith.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   The word "peaceful" is one of those Hebrew words
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   that you can't translate with one word into English.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   So if you look at the NIV,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   it's translated, NIV and the ESV
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   translates that word as "quiet."
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Right? So kind of related.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   New King James
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   translates that word "mild."
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Which is a little bit different, nuanced.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   King James version,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   which is almost just straight plain,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   it just tells you what it is,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   and it's translated "plain."
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Jacob was just plain.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   That's a little bit different than "peaceful."
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   "Peaceful" sounds pretty good.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   That he's not a man of war.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   But King James says, "He's just plain."
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Right?
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   So all of these words are very specifically nuanced words
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   because you can't translate it with one word.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   In fact, the literal understanding of that word
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   means "complete."
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   You can kind of see where that word comes from.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   "Complete" meaning that you're not striving for anything.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   You're just kind of content.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   So I think the best way to summarize all these words
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   is he was just a content man.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   He wasn't out there striving.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   He just lived in this tent, did what his mommy told him to do.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   He was just content.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   That's how he's described.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   This great man of faith,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   he was just peaceful, mild, plain, content.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Where Esau was a man of the field.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   He was a hunter.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   So keep that in the back of your mind
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   as we continue to go on this narrative.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Verse 28, "Now Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for game,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   but Rebekah loved Jacob."
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Obviously Rebekah would love Jacob
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   because Jacob's the one always by her side.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   Right?
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   And you could tell why Isaac would love Esau
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   because Esau's a manly man.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   He's out there getting animals to come back and feed his family.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   He's doing manly things.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   Verse 29, "When Jacob had cooked stew,
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Esau came in from the field and he was famished.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   And Esau said to Jacob, 'Please let me have a swallow of that red stuff there,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   for I am famished.'
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Therefore his name is called Edom."
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   But look at this.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   The older brother comes in.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   He's hungry because he was hunting.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   He said, "I'm hungry. Can you give me that stew?"
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   And Jacob says, "Give me your birthright."
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   You talk about an unfair exchange.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   How can you possibly think that that's fair?
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   "Give me your birthright. I'll give you a little bit of stew.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   Give me your birthright."
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   I mean, he's not somebody that we would look at,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   at least from the narrative, looking at it.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   It's like, "Well, Jacob's not the type of guy that you'd want to be friends with."
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   He's conniving to take away his birthright.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   And then Esau, you know, he's just being a man of the field,
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   he doesn't really think through.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   He said, "Behold, I am about to die."
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   So what use then is the birthright to me?
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   He's a little dramatic.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   He's hungry. He's not going to die.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   He's like, "A little bit of stew."
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Jacob said, "First swear to me."
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   So he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   "What good is it? I'm going to die.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   I'll give you my birthright. What good is that to me?
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Give me a little bit of stew."
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Now, you have to understand what happens here in that text,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   as silly as that is, determines Esau's fate.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   Not only him, but all his descendants.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   And if you remember the history of Israel,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Edomites keep coming up in the prophets saying how Edomites are judged
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   because they gloated over the judgment of Israel.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   They were always a stumbling block to the nation of Israel.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   Where did all that start?
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   It started right here.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Because he was hungry, and he was overdramatic.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   He said, "What good is the birthright?"
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   And he sold it for a pot of stew.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Jacob, on the other hand, he becomes--his name gets changed to Israel,
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   one who wrestles with God.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   And God's redemptive plan comes through this line.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Well, how did he get it?
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   He tricked his brother.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   Instead of being generous and saying, "Man, you must be famished,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   and you brought all this game for us to eat."
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   He said, "Well, if you want that, give me your birthright."
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   Maybe knowing his weakness, took advantage of his brother.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And that's how--that's how redemptive history--
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   the redemptive nation of Israel is named after this guy
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   because he does this.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   We look at that and say, "I don't get this."
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   Why is God allowing this?
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   Why would such an important thing happen in this way and is allowed?
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Well, you have to understand that the birthright here
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   is much more than an average family's birthright.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   In verse 34, Jacob gave Esau the bread and lentil,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   and he ate and drank and rose and went on his way.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   He's like, "I'm satisfied. I gave my birthright."
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   It didn't cost him anything, at least not immediately.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   But it says, "Thus Esau despised his birthright."
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Now, typically, when a father passes away at that particular time,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   the firstborn would get the double portion of whatever the other children would get.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   But the birthright here, the blessing here,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   is not simply talking about financial gain.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   That because he's the firstborn, he said, "What good is it to me?
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   I should have gotten $10,000. I'm going to get $5,000."
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   That's not what he's referring to.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   When he says he despised his birthright,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   this is no ordinary birthright.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Remember, Isaac was the sacrifice that Abraham was supposed to give.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   So Isaac, in redemptive history, represented the type of Christ.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   His possible death and resurrection, coming back from the dead,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   God delivering him, was given through Isaac.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   So Isaac, I can almost guarantee, knew full well why his father was doing that.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   His father, he probably asked him, "What did you do that for?"
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   And I can guarantee, right, if Abraham left Ur of the Chaldeans,
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   he was already a pretty wealthy man when he left,
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   and he's wandering into desert or in areas where he's not safe.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Any human being would say, "Well, if we want to live a nice and comfortable life,
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   just go back to Ur of the Chaldeans. Why are we doing this?"
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   The only reason why he did it is because God said to go.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   He promised him.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   This covenant promise was the only reason why they did what they did,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   because what Abraham did didn't make any sense.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   So I don't think it's a stretch to think that Abraham took every opportunity
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   to tell Isaac about the covenant blessing.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   We're no ordinary family.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   And I can guarantee that Isaac told Jacob and Esau about this blessing,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   about what happened to him.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   The greatest event that happened in Isaac's life was what happened at Mount Moriah,
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   explaining to them what God was going to do.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   So when Esau said, "Well, what good is my birthright when I'm hungry?"
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   He wasn't simply rejecting the double portion.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   He was rejecting the promise.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   "What good is all of that when I'm hungry and I'm about to die?"
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   And that's why it says he despised his birthright.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   In Genesis 26, 3-4, God reminds Isaac of this covenant.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   This is what it says.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Does that sound familiar?
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   Does what he says sound familiar?
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Yes.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   This is exactly, almost verbatim, repeated in Genesis 12, 1, 2, and 3.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   This is the covenant that God made with Abraham and his descendants.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   And it's reminding Isaac, and again, I don't think it's a stretch to think that
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   Jacob and Esau knew this very well.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   And Esau just kind of, like, "What good is that?
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   What good is the future?
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   What good is the blessing?
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   What good is the covenant promise if I'm hungry and I'm going to die?"
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   You see, Esau would have been the better leader.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   In fact, the Scripture says Isaac loved Esau.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   Not only was, by law, was he obligated to bless his older son,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   he wanted to bless his older son because that's the one that would make sense.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   He's the firstborn, and he's a manly man.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   If you were to choose a leader for the covenant promise to lead the nation of
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Israel, whenever God establishes that, whose line would you choose?
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   The hunter who knows how to fight?
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   He knows how to use his weapons?
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   He's a man of the field.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   Or Jacob, smooth, plain, content, quiet, mama's boy, right?
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   I mean, he doesn't fit.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   If you were to put on paper who should lead, where the covenant should go to
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   fulfill this great promise, Jacob does not fit the mold.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   And he said, on top of that, Esau was very hairy, which is going to come out later.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   Everything that you would think about a testosterone-driven, manly man who's
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   going to lead this nation to conquer their enemies, Esau fit that description.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   And Jacob did not.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   And yet, Rebekah hears about the plan that Isaac is about to bless his son,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   and she schemes.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   And look what she does.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   She suggests to Jacob, your father at his old age, he doesn't see well, so I have
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   a plan.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   Instead of having Esau be blessed, I want you to be blessed, right?
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   And so he said, well, look how it's described in verse 11.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   "Jacob answered his mother and said, 'Behold, Esau, my brother, is hairy man,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   and I am a smooth man.'" Right?
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   You know, the thing that pops out at me is Jacob doesn't say, that don't sound
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   right.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   He said, I'm going to trick my dad.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   He doesn't say that.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   He's not worried about is it right or wrong.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   He doesn't worry about, like, that's my older brother, I can't do that to him.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   He doesn't say that.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   He said, do you think it'll work?
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   That's what he's asking.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   "Perhaps my father will feel me, then I will be a deceiver in his sight, and I
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   will bring upon myself a curse and not a blessing."
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   So he's not worried about his dad.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   He's not worried about his brother.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   He's worried about, what if this backfires?
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   Do you think this will really work?
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   Verse 13, "But his mother said to him, 'Your curse be on me, my son.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   Only obey my voice and go get them for me.'" So this guy didn't even have enough
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   courage.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   What if this backfires, doesn't work, he's hairy and I'm not, you know?
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   And I know he's old and he's blind, but it's just too obvious.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   He said, "Don't worry, any consequence, I'll take it.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   You just do what I say." So he did what his mommy told him to do, right?
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   That's what it says, verse 14.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   "So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and his mother made
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   savory food such as his father loved.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   Then Rebecca took the best garments of Esau, her older son, which were with her
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son, and put the skin of the
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   She also gave the savory food and the bread which she had made to her son,
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   Jacob." Doesn't this sound like a comedy skit?
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   This is redemptive history.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   This is the formation of Israel where Jesus is going to come through that line.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   And the way that he gets the blessing is he puts on goat skin so that he can
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   pretend like his brother.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   And the first thing I think of is just how hairy was Esau that he was going to
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   touch the goat's fur and think this is Esau.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   He must have been really hairy, right?
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   Because it works.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Look what it says.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   In verse 21, "Then Isaac said to Jacob, 'Please come close that I may feel you,
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not.'
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   So Jacob came close to Isaac his father, and he felt him and said,
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   'The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.'"
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   Just how hairy was this guy?
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   He was literally touching goat skin.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   He said, "Oh, that sounds, you know, it sounds like Jacob,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   but it feels like Esau."
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   Understand what's going on.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   God's covenant blessing is coming down through this, through this.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   You know, there's a lot of strange things in the Bible that sometimes we read
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   and we're just kind of like, oh, it's hard to understand.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   So, you know, a lot of times we treat Leviticus like that, right?
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   We come through Leviticus and it's like, what?
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   Blood where?
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   How many animals?
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   Women can't sit where?
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   And you go through all that and say, oh, I don't understand.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   I trust God.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   There's something important going on, but you just kind of move up, right?
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   But some of the greatest treasures in the Bible are hidden in these things, right?
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   I mean, I remember the time when I was preaching through the Old Testament
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   and I got through Judges.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   And I came to Judges, and Judges is a constant cycle of Israel.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   You know, everyone did what was right in their own eyes
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   because they didn't have a king, and they would continually fall into sin,
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   and then they would cry out to God when they're oppressed,
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   and then God raises up a judge.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   And there's a couple stories in there that just --
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   I had such a hard time preaching because I didn't know what the point was.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   There's a guy named Eglon.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   Some of you guys may know him.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   And he said that Eglon was a guy who was a ruler oppressing Israel,
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   and God raises up a Benjamite, and he goes and kills him,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   but the guy is so obese that he sticks the knife in him,
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   and he can't pull it back out because he gets stuck, right?
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   And the Bible describes this.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   It doesn't end there.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   He gets stuck, and then he's able to escape because his guards don't come in.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   And the reason why they don't come in is because they thought he was relieving himself
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   for a long time, that he was in the bathroom and he wasn't coming out.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   And Israel is delivered.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   That's in Judges.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   So I remember studying through that.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   I was like, "What am I going to preach on this?
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   I'm going to preach on God teaching us through this couldn't pull the knife out,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   therefore trust God."
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   Like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's the point here?"
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   And I remember very specifically what I preached there,
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   which I would not preach again,
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   but I remember preaching that when you are not right with God,
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   that even people like Eglon can defeat you.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   Like, that was my point.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   Then we talk about Samson.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   This man of faith.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   This guy was a drunken womanizer.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   So when I took a close look at him, he was like,
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   "This is the judge that God raised to deliver Israel?"
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   There's a lot of stories in the Bible where it just doesn't fit.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   Well, this is one of them.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   This is one of those things where it's like, "What?
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   He did what?"
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   And think about Esau.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   Think about Isaac.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   It says, "By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob."
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   But when you read the redemptive history,
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   what does faith have to do with this?
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   Think about it.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   He's about to bless his son.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   Everything that Abraham did, everything that he went through,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   is all coming down to the next generation.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   And the way it happened was, like, "You sound like Jacob,
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   but you feel like Esau.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   All right, I'll bless you."
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   That's how it happened.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   And then it says, "By faith."
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   How do we reconcile this?
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   Why did God allow this in redemptive history?
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   Why through this line?
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   Why in this way?
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   In fact, if you look at Jesus' genealogy, this is Jesus, the Son of God.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   There's prostitutes, adulterers, and murderers in Jesus' genealogy.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   Right?
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   And God orchestrated this, and yet we see people in there,
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   it's like, "What?
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   That person's in Jesus' genealogy?"
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   Why did God not nullify this blessing?
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   Why wasn't Jacob punished for his lying and scheming?
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   Why did Esau lose his covenant birthright?
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   Because of his youthful mistake.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   What does this have to do with faith?
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   Again, I told you that the main point is at the end, so we're at the end.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   You look at Esau, it's like, "Wow, that's unfair for Esau."
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   How many of us have made dumb decisions when we were young?
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   And because of that, his whole heritage, all his descendants,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   started going down the wrong path.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   What happened? Why was he--?
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   In fact, in Hebrews 12, the chapter we're going to get to pretty soon,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   in verse 16 and 17, describes Esau this way,
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   "That there be no immoral or godless person like Esau,
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   who sold his own birthright for a single meal.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   For you know that even afterwards, when he desired to inherit the blessings,
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance,
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   though he sought for it with tears."
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   And in Genesis itself, in 25-34, it says,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   "And Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate it and drank and rose
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   and went on his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright."
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   We may look at this particular event and say, "Well, he made a mistake.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   He was hungry, and he wasn't thinking properly,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   and there was a mental lapse for a minute,
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   and that's what led to this.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   And because of that, he's called immoral and godless,
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   who despised his birthright?"
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   You have to understand that the rejection of his birthright
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   was not simply a rejection of twofold.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   It was a rejection of all the promise that God made
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   to him and to all the descendants.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   God was planning to bring about the salvation of mankind
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   through the nation of Israel.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   And so when he rejected, when he despised it,
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   it may seem like a small act, but from God's perspective, it was immoral.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   From God's perspective, it was godless.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   There was no God in his decision.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   And he says, "It was despised."
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   You know the word for glory in the Bible literally simply means "weighty."
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   Something serious. That's what the word "glory" means.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   There's something weighty.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   So when it says that he simply despised it, he considered it as nothing.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   He compared his birthright, the promise of God, the covenant promise,
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   and he compared it with his hunger, and his hunger was more important.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   And he simply despised it.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   What we may look at as a simple mistake, a useful indiscretion,
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   God says, "No, you rejected."
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   In fact, in Mark 3.28, it says,
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   "Truly I say to you, all sins shall be forgiven, the sons of man.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   And whatever blasphemy they utter,
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness,
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   but is guilty of an eternal sin."
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   He said all things can be forgiven except for those who reject his promise.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   And that's exactly what it says that Esau did.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   Esau considered the weightiness of what God was doing,
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   and he took it flippantly.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   How often do you and I look at simple indiscretions
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   and not realizing what we are doing?
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   Where we live, it's like, you know what?
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   Of course God is important.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   I'm not saying that God is not important, but I've got to pay my bills.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   I've got to raise my children.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   I've got to get married.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   I've got to do this, and I've got to do that.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   And so we don't look at it as a rejection of God.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   We just simply say, "I'm hungry now.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   I've got to take care of my needs first, and then I'll consider the big picture,"
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   not realizing that we may be rejecting, despising the promises of God.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   The small things that sometimes seem so urgent in our lives
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   in the context of eternity is so trivial.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   Whether we become millionaires, become famous,
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   where our children grow up to become superstars and taken care of,
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   and we live to 105 years old, all of that eternity is very, very trivial.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   But the things that God says in His Word has eternal value.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   So His covenant promise, Esau's great sin was that he considered the covenant of God,
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   not weightiness.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   Jacob's, he's a guy who's like, "Well, okay, now we see why Esau's sin was so great,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   but look at the way Jacob did what he did.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   How can he be such a great man?"
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   The Bible says that if you have a faith of a mustard seed--
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   I don't know if you've ever seen a mustard seed.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   Mustard seed looks like a lint.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   It's so tiny, but if you see that plant, and when it grows, it grows into this great tree.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   He says if you have a seed, if you have faith of a mustard seed, you can move what?
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   Mountains.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   So the point that Jesus was making is not that you're a great man,
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   it's not your great achievements, but if you have faith in this great God,
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   even if it's tiny like a mustard seed, even if it's hard to see, but it's there,
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   even if you have that, you will see the power of God.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   That's what he said.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   And that power isn't the man.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   His power is that tiny little connection to this power is where the power is.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   That's what Jesus was trying to teach them.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   Jacob is a perfect example of a man who had tiny faith, at least at this time,
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   or at least what we see at this time in his life.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   I think the best way for us to understand what Jacob did is this way.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.000]   I don't know if you've ever been to a large conference, you have, you know,
[00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   like celebrity pastors come and speak in great sermons, great music,
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   and people are there lined up early.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   The doors open up.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   They're like beating everybody to the front seat, and they get there,
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   and then they save 50 seats.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   All their friends and family and cousins who may come there, may not come there,
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   but they're saving all the seats, and everybody else is ticked off.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   Right?
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   What are they doing?
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   You know, this is a conference.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   This is like we came here to worship.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   And so people watching that may look at it and say, "What are they doing?
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   They're so selfish."
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   But the reason why they're doing that is because they want the great seats.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   They wanted to be in the front and have the best seats so that they can have the best blessing.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   They can have the greatest views.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   They can see whoever is speaking, all the nuances and emotions on their face,
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   so they want to have the best --
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   and the motive behind what they're doing is great.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   But the method in which they did it ticks off a lot of people.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   I don't know if you've ever been to a big conference.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   You know, I've been to big conferences like that where it's just eager.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   It's like, you know, iPhone 18 is coming out, and they have to be the first ones to get it,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   and they run, and they're literally running against other people.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   And they get there, and they spread out like, "Mine!"
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   I look at what Jacob does here is similar to that.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   You know, you could see that tiny faith where he understood what he was getting, and he wanted it.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   Let me ask you, what does God want from us more than anything else?
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   More than anything else?
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   To be Bible scholars?
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   To plant many churches?
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   To make disciples of the nations?
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   Now, all of these things are commanded in Scripture.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   But what does he desire of us more than anything else?
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   To love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   To love him.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   To desire him.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   To want him.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   And that's what worship is.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   When we value something, when we desire something, worship comes from that.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   He didn't just say plant churches, and make disciples, and pray, and do all this, and be a good Christian,
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   and get things done, bear a lot of fruit so that other people can...
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   He said, "All of these things are true, but the biggest, the most important thing..."
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   In fact, he says, "All of that thing, all of those things that I desire can really be summed up in one thing.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   To love God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength."
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   Jacob, as foolish as he was, as questionable as the method was,
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   he valued what God promised his family.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   And he went and ran to the front seat.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   And that tiny little faith, that tiny little faith is what brought the blessing upon his life.
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   In Jeremiah 29, 13, "You will seek me and find me when you search me with all your heart."
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   With all your heart.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   And you see that repeated over, and over, and over again, all throughout Scripture.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   You know, the challenge of being a Christian for a while, knowing things, studying the Bible,
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   is we seek him, but not with all our heart.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   I think all of us can remember when we first became Christian, when Christ was everything.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   He was just not a good thing. He was everything.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   Your life got flipped upside down. Nothing else seemed to matter.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   And for the rest of our Christian life is to look back at that,
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   and try to be that same person I was when I first met Christ.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   Because that's what God desires from us more than anything else.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   That's why Hebrews 11, 6, it says, "Without faith it is impossible to please him,
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   for he who comes to God must believe that he is, and he is a rewarder of those who seek him."
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   But that word "seek" isn't just passively seeking.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   NIV says it is earnestly seeking.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   King James, in New King James, says, "He who diligently seek him with all his heart."
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   In fact, Jacob, this slippery mama's boy, who used all of his trickery to get the blessing,
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   he's the guy where his name gets changed to Israel, the one who contends with God.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   And that's the name of Israel, the apple of his eye.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   He calls them people who wrestles with me, who wants me.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   That's the name he gives them.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   Because that's what he wants from all of us, to be people who are contending for God,
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   who want him more than anything else, more than church, more than friendship,
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   more than financial security.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   I want him.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   And if there's anything that is highlighted in Jacob's life,
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   is that through all of his trickery, he wanted God.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   He wrestled with God.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   And that's why he has a limp on his side, because he wrestled with God.
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   He's like, "I'm not going to let you go until you bless me."
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   That's why Jacob became Israel.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   You look at Isaac.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   Why didn't he just reverse it?
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   Why didn't he, when he realized that he was tricked, say, "Okay, forget it.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   I knew you didn't sound like my son Esau."
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   You have to understand that at that time, for him to bestow a blessing,
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   he wasn't simply doing it on his behalf.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   He was doing it on God's behalf.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   That wasn't for him to give.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   That was God's to give.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   For him to reverse what he did would have not simply been reversing what he said,
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   but to go on against God.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   Because in the oral tradition, basically declaring that would have been no different
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   than signing a legal document saying, "I hand all this over to you."
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   And it wasn't in his authority to simply just wipe that out.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   So as small and tiny his faith may have been, it was still faith.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   The point of all of this is all of this is described in verse 20.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   "By faith Isaac blessed Jacob."
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   You notice Jacob's name comes first here.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   Because he's a younger brother, but his name comes first here
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   because he was the one who receives the covenant blessing.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   Esau gets the other stuff.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   They're blessed, even regarding things to come.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   So the point of the story is not about Isaac.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   The point of the story is not about Jacob.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   It's not about Esau.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   Ultimately, it's about a faithful God who keeps his promise,
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   even through all this mess.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   And if there's one thing that stands out of all of this, it's this tiny faith.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   This tiny faith that connects them to this great God
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   is why you and I are still here today.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   We could probably pinpoint a minimum of two to three dozen times
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   in redemptive history where you and I should have been gone.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   I mean, think about a thousand years of the Catholics
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   restricting God's people from his word.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   And literally killing people for wanting to translate his word.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   Selling salvation through indulgences.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   We're not talking about a couple years.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   We're talking about generations.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   We don't have to go that far.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   Look at the chaos that you and I are in today.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   I mean, people say, like, "It's hard to find a church where the word of God is taught."
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   I mean, as sad as that is,
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   how many of you knew people that you thought were men of God at one point
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   and were disappointed?
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   All of us.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   I'm pretty sure I've disappointed you.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   Pretty sure.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   And if I have it, it's because you're new.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   When we look at man,
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   the end conclusion is always--
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   it's going to end in anxiety.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   We're going to be distraught.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   How can God allow this?
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   If the only reason why you and I are still here is because Jesus said,
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   "I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   It was small faith in a great God why you and I are here today.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   So if there's anything that we learn from this,
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   anchor in Christ.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   Anchor in Christ.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   Not your friendship, not your community,
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   not your bank account,
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   not other people.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   In Christ.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   Let me read a couple of verses for you before we end.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   2 Corinthians 1:20, "For as many as are the promises of God,
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   in Him they are yes.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   Therefore also through Him is our amen to the glory of God through us."
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   1 Peter 1:24, "For all flesh like grass and all its glory like the flowers of the grass.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   The grass withers and the flower falls off, but the word of the Lord endures forever.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   And this is the word which was preached to you."
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   Amen.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   Let's pray.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   As our worship team comes up, why don't we take a few minutes to reflect and to pray.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   If our hearts had caused us to drift,
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   put our confidence in things that we shouldn't have.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   Maybe there's people who have disappointed you in life,
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   and you are drifting as a result of that.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   I hope that this would serve as a reminder to us that our God is sovereign.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   There's times when we feel like our faith is even smaller than a mustard seed.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   And yet it is that tiny mustard seed that connects us to God,
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   where we see God being faithful to His promise.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   So wherever you are in your faith, let's take some time to pray
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   and ask the Lord to open our eyes so that we may see the glory, the weightedness of who He is,
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   and that we may not despise the things that God has called us to be.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team comes up.
