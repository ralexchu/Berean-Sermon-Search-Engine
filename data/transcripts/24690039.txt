[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   (Applause)
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:11.500]   Good morning.
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.500]   Okay.
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.000]   As many of you guys know, about a month ago, my wife and I,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.500]   we had a kid, a baby boy named Josiah.
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.500]   He's cute. (Laughter)
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.500]   I know it's biased because it's coming from me, but he's super cute.
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.000]   In the beginning, he looked just like a little old man.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Now he's plumping up, so he's just a cute baby.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.500]   His Korean, his name is Josiah, and in Korean, that name is Yoshiya.
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.000]   So we decided to give him the nickname Yoshi.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Yeah, that's cute too. (Laughter)
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.500]   Just super cute kid all around.
[00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.500]   But I'll tell you what.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.000]   There are various circumstances in life that make you
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   just want to sigh.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.500]   You don't want to complain. There's not much you can do.
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.500]   You just sigh. You know what I mean?
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.500]   And in the last month, I'd have to say,
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.000]   all sorts of various circumstances have arisen where I just wanted to sigh.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   There are times when you're just frustrated.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Maybe the frustration you have with your parents or something.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   You can't really say anything or do anything, so you just sigh.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.500]   Or when we've been up late night, and Josiah just would not sleep.
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.000]   He just cried. If you put him down, he'd cry.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.500]   We did everything that the nurses and doctors told us to do,
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.500]   but he just didn't want to sleep.
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.000]   What can you do? So he just... (Sigh)
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.500]   And I think for me, there's a passage, the passage that we're covering today.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.500]   It's a passage that's very dear to my heart
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.500]   because in moments when I felt that need to sigh,
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.500]   I just felt weary.
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.500]   This passage just spoke to my heart.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.000]   At times, not even just when physically I was fatigued
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   or just life situations brought it about,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.500]   but even in my own heart, maybe because of certain failures,
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.500]   even sins that I struggle with.
[00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.000]   I'm sure you've been there.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.500]   Because of your own sins, you genuinely ask yourself,
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.500]   "Oh man, am I ever going to overcome this?"
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.500]   (Sigh)
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.500]   In those times, this passage has so refreshed my heart.
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.500]   It caused me to worship the Lord in a new, fervent way.
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.500]   And so I wanted to share this passage with you.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.500]   If you can, please turn over to Psalm 121.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.500]   Psalm 121.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:38.000]   This comes in a series of psalms, starting from Psalm 120
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.500]   and 15 chapters forward that are called the Songs of Ascent.
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.500]   And it reads like this.
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.500]   "I will lift up my eyes to the mountains,
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.000]   from where shall my help come?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.500]   My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.500]   He will not allow your foot to slip.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.500]   He who keeps you will not slumber.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.500]   Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.500]   The Lord is your keeper.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.500]   The Lord is your shade on your right hand.
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.000]   The sun will not smite you by day, nor the moon by night.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   The Lord will protect you from all evil.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.500]   He will keep your soul.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.500]   The Lord will guard your going out and your coming in.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.500]   From this time forth and forever."
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.500]   Let's pray for the Lord's blessing on our time.
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.000]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you so much, God.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.500]   Lord, we do see our time of worship as precious to us,
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.500]   but such a privilege to come to give you worship that you deserve.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.500]   And we ask God, first and foremost, Lord, that you be pleased.
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.500]   God, we pray that you would grant us
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.000]   the sense of minds and humble hearts to listen and apply.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And God, by having faith, it would be manifested into our lives.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.500]   And by having faith into your word,
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.500]   it would be saturated and applied, Lord God,
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.000]   into our weeks and our lives, Lord.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   So we pray, Father God, for fruit.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.500]   We pray for the working of your Spirit.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.500]   It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:19.000]   When we read this psalm, the very first verse of the psalm says,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.500]   "I will lift up my eyes to the mountains."
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.500]   Now, if I can give you guys a little bit of a backdrop,
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.500]   the psalms are called "Songs of Ascent"
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.000]   because they believe that the tribe, the nation, so to speak,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   was moving towards Jerusalem.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.500]   So actually, physically, they were going from lowlands
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.000]   up into the mountain, Mount Zion.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   And in their journey, in their trek, they would sing these songs.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   But interestingly enough, the content of the songs would also move.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   It would move up.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.500]   It would move from, a lot of times, a cry in despair.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.500]   "I am troubled!"
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.500]   If you look at the first verse of chapter 120, it says,
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.000]   "In my trouble I cried out to the Lord."
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.500]   It begins that way.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.000]   And if you notice, even in this psalm, it will start moving
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.500]   from one thought to the next,
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.000]   and it will build, ascending eventually to a praise
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   and worshiping of the Lord.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.500]   So just picture with me this psalm
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.500]   coming from a group of people who are moving and traveling in tents.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.500]   And a lot of times, if you're moving and traveling
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.000]   and you're resting for the night, what ends up happening is this.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.500]   You want to rest on high ground. Why? Because that's advantageous for you.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.000]   You've got the bandits, you've got the valley,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   which is just so susceptible to any kind of raiding,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.500]   whereas the mountaintops, it kind of provides a natural protection.
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.500]   And so, naturally, he says, in a time of need,
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.000]   as he says he's in trouble, he'll look up to the mountains.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   He'll look up.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.500]   Interestingly enough, I want to, just from the very beginning,
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.000]   ask you a question.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.500]   Are you guys looking for help?
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.500]   Are you guys even looking for help?
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.500]   What do I mean by that?
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.500]   You know, there are people who recognize that they need help in life,
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.000]   whether it be physical, whether it be daily needs,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   things that are common to every single individual,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   difficulties in life, but there are also spiritual needs
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   and there are needs that are very, very severe.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   But oftentimes, we just have an extreme difficulty asking for help.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And if you guys remember my previous sermon,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I preached on a leper who was humble and knew that he was in a devastating position.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And he asked for help. Why? Because he realized he needed it.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.500]   Whereas an individual, perhaps like myself and perhaps in this generation,
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.000]   our self-confidence and self-dependence is just too prevalent.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Because in all honesty, when I read the Psalms,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.500]   I read of King David who's crying out to God,
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.000]   "Lord, there are enemies against me surrounding the nation.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Their arrows and their spears are ready to attack."
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   And I'm reading that and I'm like, "I don't relate to that.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I don't feel like enemies are against me."
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.500]   And in terms of asking for help because they're traveling,
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.000]   they want help from the sun or help just in, you know, I don't know.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   It just seems too trivial to ask for God.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.500]   Like, I'm not going to ask God for help because it's raining.
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.500]   Like, get an umbrella.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.500]   I'm not going to ask God for help because I just need to eat today.
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.000]   You know? I just need to go and pop something in the microwave.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.500]   Sometimes it's just either things seem too trivial
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.000]   or at other times, if it's because of my failure,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.500]   I'm just too prideful to ask.
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.000]   For example, if I'm having difficulty reading the Bible,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.500]   do you guys feel the need to ask God for help for that?
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.500]   In all honesty, if you're having difficulty with your daily devotion
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.500]   and daily giving of worship to God,
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.000]   would you ask God for help for that?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.500]   When was the last time you asked for help in that kind of honest manner?
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.500]   My first question really is, in our generation, are you even looking for help?
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.500]   And when you are looking for help, where are you looking now?
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.000]   Are you looking up to the mountains and the general things that people generally look for?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Because for us, generally it's this.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.500]   I'm in some kind of frustrating bind,
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.000]   whether because I need financial money, financial struggles.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.500]   I'm in some kind of help.
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.500]   Generally, we think the more set our life is in terms of pattern and finances,
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.000]   the better it will be.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.500]   My question to you this morning, are you even looking for help?
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.500]   And if you are, where are you looking for that help?
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.500]   We read on here and it says this.
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.500]   "I will lift up my eyes to the mountains, from where shall my help come?"
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.000]   He's not really asking, like he doesn't know.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Like, "Oh no, who's going to help me?"
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.500]   He's asking to make a point.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.500]   And the point is this.
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.500]   "My help comes from the Lord who made heaven and earth."
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.500]   Do we look all over the world?
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.500]   Do we look all over to our family and friends?
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.500]   Do we look to a particular individual to help us?
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.500]   Or do we look to the Lord, believing He is fully capable
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.500]   and fully powerful enough to help you?
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.500]   Regardless of whether it's physical.
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.500]   There's nothing wrong with the Christian
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:25.500]   who finds himself in some kind of common bind or difficult situation,
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.500]   whether it be financial, health related, whatever,
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.500]   and seeking God's strength in that time.
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.500]   But I hope we're not doing that only then,
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.500]   but we're asking the Lord's help in every situation,
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.500]   whether it be your spiritual life, daily disciplines,
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.500]   or your own sins and struggles.
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.500]   But the first question we have to ask is,
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.500]   do we really believe God is capable to meet those needs?
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.500]   Because if we believed it, perhaps we would be going more often
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:54.500]   and more frequently and more fervently at the feet of the Lord.
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.500]   And so the psalmist is going to describe for us
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.500]   and answer that question,
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.500]   is the Lord capable?
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.500]   Is the Lord sufficient to meet all of those needs?
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.500]   And the very first thing he says is this,
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.500]   "My help comes from the Lord, who made the heaven and the earth."
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.500]   You want to know whether God is capable of meeting your needs?
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.500]   Let me remind you of the fact that God created the heavens and the earth.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.500]   You know, Jesus Christ in His earthly ministry,
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.500]   if you remember, He was somewhat frustrated with people.
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.500]   He would do a miracle and people would be like,
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.500]   "Wow! Did you hear?"
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.500]   And they would be ecstatic, and they would be so infatuated with His miracles.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.500]   "Show us more! Give us more!"
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.500]   And Jesus Christ is sitting there, sometimes frustrated.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.500]   Are you so excited because of the miracles?
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.500]   Do you realize that I could call at any time
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.500]   and create out of nothing, ex nihilo?
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.500]   He created the heavens and the earth.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.500]   You think He can't provide for your needs now?
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.500]   Out of nothing, poof! I can create.
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.500]   And you think I can't sustain you in your day?
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:07.500]   This psalmist is saying, "My help comes from the Creator."
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.500]   It's almost this question of, "Is He capable?"
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.500]   It's almost a, "Duh! Of course He's capable!"
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.500]   The universe He called into being.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:22.500]   If I need something, if I am weary, if I am fatigued,
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.500]   the Lord who created our known world will come to help.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.500]   That's the one who I'm calling upon.
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.500]   That's the one who I'm looking to.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.500]   And so we move forward in asking this question,
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.500]   "Is the Lord able to help us?"
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.500]   "Is the Lord capable of sustaining us?"
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.500]   I'm going to restart reading from verse 1 again,
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.500]   just so that we can reiterate this passage.
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.500]   To have this effect of just resonating in your minds.
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.500]   Verse 1.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.500]   "I will lift up my eyes to the mountains.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.500]   From where shall my help come?
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.500]   My help comes from the Lord who made the heavens and the earth.
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.500]   He will not allow your foot to slip.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.500]   He who keeps you will not slumber.
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:10.500]   Behold, He who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep."
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.500]   Verse 2, verse 3 and 4, I would like to label,
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.500]   "The Lord keeps you like a shepherd."
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.500]   Look what He's saying here.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.500]   And think about what a good shepherd would do.
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.500]   The good shepherd would constantly watch his flock
[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.500]   and see if any one of the sheep is going astray.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.500]   See if any one of the sheep, because they're always sitting there,
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.500]   grazing on the ground, blindly going off cliffs and so forth,
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.500]   whether their feet are going to slip.
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.500]   So the good shepherd, the great shepherd is watching.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.500]   And our God is so good. Our God is so omniscient.
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.500]   Just because He's watching one sheep doesn't mean He's loose-eyed on the other.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.500]   He watches every single thing.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:54.500]   And I love that because, again, when I think of the ways in which I falter,
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.500]   because I'm not paying attention and there's distracting things all around me,
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.500]   I believe it in my spiritual walk and being sanctified as a Christian.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:07.500]   Who is going to keep my feet from stumbling?
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.500]   Is it me?
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.500]   I don't think so.
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.500]   The scripture clearly says, "The Lord is watching as a good shepherd
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.500]   so that my feet will not slip."
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.500]   And when the scripture says, "He's going to keep,"
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.500]   it's often translated, again, as one who has a watchful eye,
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.500]   as one who is preserving by careful watching.
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:32.500]   A lot of times, actually, that verb shows up as a noun form, as a watchman.
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:36.500]   So He's watching you like a good shepherd.
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.500]   Let me give you an example. Use Yoshi.
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.500]   A lot of times I'll come home and Bea--
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:48.500]   Honestly, I have newfound respect for moms because I watch Bea and I'm like,
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.500]   "I could not do what you do all day long."
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.500]   If Josiah is fussy, she just has to take care of him.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.500]   And at night, sometimes I want to help her, so I'll try to take care of him a little bit.
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.500]   It's a funny story, right? It's a little comedic.
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.500]   So I take him and I'm trying to console him and watch him and stuff.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.500]   But it's nighttime, like 11 p.m. sometimes.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.500]   He gets up at 9, 11, 2, and then 5.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.500]   So we're up, right?
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.500]   And I'm standing there like, "Whoa."
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.500]   I'm falling asleep, like leaning over and kind of swaying.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.500]   So she'll come by and be like, "Here, here, let me take him."
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.500]   So she'll take him.
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.500]   But I'm so sleepy, I don't really realize what I'm doing.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.500]   I'm like, "Here, here, here."
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.500]   And then I still have the blanket in my arm.
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.500]   So I'll go out and I'll wake up.
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.500]   "Oh, my God, where's the baby?"
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.500]   And then I'll take the blanket and I'm looking around,
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.500]   looking around, and I drop the baby, right?
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.500]   And I'm like, "Bia's going to be so mad I dropped the baby."
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.500]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.500]   You don't know how fast my heart's pumping at that time
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.500]   because I'm like, "I lost my baby," right?
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.500]   And the funny thing is, Bia has had those moments, too.
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.500]   I'm not sure she'll appreciate me sharing these stories.
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.500]   But plenty of times, she'll feel the baby.
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.500]   She'll already put him down, but she's so tired, she kind of forgets.
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.500]   And she actually would fall asleep with her arm like this.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.500]   And then I'll see her wake up and she'll be like--
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.500]   (Laughter)
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.500]   I just see her tripping out and I'm thinking, laughing.
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.500]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.500]   And it's funny. It's funny now.
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.500]   And there are times when I hear Bia talking to the baby
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.500]   and I hear what she's saying.
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.500]   And the baby's crying and she's doing other things,
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.500]   so she'll run over there, she's like, "I'm sorry, you're crying."
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.500]   And then if she falls asleep, she's like,
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.500]   "Oh, I promise I love you, I care for you."
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.500]   I think about that right now when I read this passage.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.500]   Even though Bia and I love and adore this precious baby--
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.500]   he's cute, okay? We love and adore this baby.
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.500]   Even though we want to, even though it's in our intention,
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.500]   even though we so desire to be there every single moment for him,
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:54.500]   you do realize we are incapable.
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.500]   Right?
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.500]   Bia and I fall short of this.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.500]   And when I read in the Scriptures that God, our Father,
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.500]   is more than willing, he is fully capable,
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.500]   he does not sleep, he does not slumber,
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.500]   he has his eye on you like a good shepherd,
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.500]   that brings such assurance to my heart.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.500]   I could even tell my wife,
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.500]   "I love you, but the Lord loves you more.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.500]   He keeps his watchful eye on you."
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.500]   Josiah, I love you, but the Lord is going to watch you in ways,
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.500]   infinite ways, greater than I can.
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.500]   Let your heart be reassured by the fact that the Lord
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.500]   has a watchful eye on you.
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.500]   We keep moving here. I'll read from verse 3 and down.
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.500]   Because that's the way the passage actually moves.
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.500]   It's ascending, okay?
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.500]   Verse 3, "He will not allow your foot to slip.
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.500]   He who keeps you will not slumber.
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.500]   Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.500]   The Lord is your keeper.
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.500]   The Lord is your shade on your right hand.
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.500]   The sun will not smite you by day, nor the moon by night."
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.500]   And we'll stop there.
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.500]   The Lord is our keeper.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.500]   I'd like to label verse 5 and 6,
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.500]   that the Lord is keeping you as a guard with treasure.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.500]   As a guard with treasure.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.500]   That's his watchful eye over us, people.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.500]   Do you understand that a guard, if he sees precious treasure,
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.500]   what is he going to do?
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.500]   He's going to make sure that there's someone watching.
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.500]   He's going to make sure that there's nothing lost.
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.500]   He makes account of it.
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.500]   He makes sure there's protection, right?
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.500]   Like a good guard, he makes sure there's ample protection.
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.500]   A case, a room, whatever it may be,
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.500]   he's going to guard that thing.
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:45.500]   Likewise, it says here, "The Lord is your keeper."
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:49.500]   He takes that position willingly of being your keeper.
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.500]   And it says here that he offers that kind of protection,
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.500]   a kind of protection that's close.
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.500]   He says, "The shade is by your right hand side.
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:01.500]   That is very near and close to you, readily available."
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.500]   That's the kind of protection God offers.
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.500]   He protects you from all the common things.
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.500]   I know for the travelers, again,
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.500]   you just picture this nation moving by tent.
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.500]   For them, the heat was an immense, immense concern.
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.500]   You know that the kind of land that they lived in,
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.500]   if you've ever heard people talk about the land of Jerusalem
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.500]   when they go out there, they're like, "Oh, yeah, it's fantastic.
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.500]   What was it like?"
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.500]   "Well, it was like dry desert."
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.500]   It's hot. It's like desert land.
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.500]   So you think about the shade. That was pivotal.
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.500]   The Lord says, "I provide that kind of protection for you."
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.500]   And I like what he says.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:40.500]   It's, "By day and by night, there is no time in which the Lord is leaving their side."
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.500]   You see that?
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:46.500]   There is no time in which the Lord is not by their side.
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.500]   So the Lord is their protector, their guardian.
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.500]   And so we move forward. It says, "The Lord is your keeper.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.500]   The Lord is your shade on your right side.
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.500]   The sun will not smite you by day, nor the moon by night."
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.500]   Verse 7 and 8.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.500]   "The Lord will protect you from all evil.
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.500]   He will keep your soul.
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.500]   The Lord will guard your going out and your coming in
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:13.500]   from this time forth and forevermore."
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.500]   Let's look once again in verse 7.
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.500]   He says, "The Lord will protect you from all evil."
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.500]   The Lord is our spiritual savior, friends.
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.500]   This reminds me of the passage here.
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.500]   In 1 Corinthians 10, 13, it says,
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.500]   "No temptation has overtaken you, but such as is common to man,
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.500]   God is faithful,
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.500]   who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able,
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.500]   but with temptation he will provide a way of escape
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.500]   so that you will be able to endure it."
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:50.500]   He is going to make sure that when it comes to spiritual evil,
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.500]   he is going to protect you.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:57.500]   He is going to protect you.
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.500]   I sometimes cannot relate to King David, and sometimes I can.
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.500]   Because I'll tell you what, I feel like every single day,
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.500]   just a matter of fact,
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.500]   the previous meeting I had with the leaders,
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.500]   I just had to confess,
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.500]   I feel like I'm being attacked with lust for more money.
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.500]   I feel like I'm being attacked with lust for more comfort.
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:21.500]   I feel like I'm always attacked with lust for sexual immorality,
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:25.500]   lust for all kinds of things, envy of what I see.
[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.500]   You think we're not in spiritual warfare?
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.500]   Of course we are.
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.500]   But the Lord says, "I'm going to protect you."
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.500]   That pronoun there, again, it moved from the nation of Israel,
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.500]   "I am the keeper of Israel," to "You,"
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.500]   "He is going to protect you."
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.500]   And you know what? Oftentimes, He is going to protect you from your own desires.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.500]   And I thank God for that, because there's plenty of it.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.500]   I am prone to sometimes wander, like the song says.
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.500]   I am prone to rebellion.
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.500]   I am prone sometimes just to not want to do things.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.500]   I just want to veg and not do the Christian life.
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.500]   The Lord is going to spiritually protect us from that evil.
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.500]   Do you believe it?
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.500]   So I'm going to ask you now, when was the last time you prayed, Matthew 6.13?
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:17.500]   Right? Where He says, "And lead us not in temptation, but to deliver us from evil."
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:22.500]   Why is it that Jesus Christ teaches us to pray that?
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.500]   We're supposed to be praying for spiritual protection from the Lord.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:31.500]   And do you believe He's the one who's going to be your keeper and not yourself?
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.500]   I think that was the problem with me.
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:38.500]   Because I always felt like, "It's my failure. I need to fix it."
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:43.500]   So every time I failed in sin, I would have the greatest frustrations.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.500]   I would have the greatest despair.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.500]   And I would sit there feeling so angry at myself.
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:55.500]   I would feel as though, "When am I going to ever get past this sin?"
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.500]   But for you, you have to believe it.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.500]   It is God who is your keeper against all evil.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:08.500]   You can't do it. God can.
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:13.500]   So He says, "I will protect you from all evil. He will keep your soul."
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.500]   And look at verse 8.
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:20.500]   It says here, "The Lord will guard your going out and your coming in."
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.500]   In Hebrew, that's a very common literary device.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.500]   It basically uses one end of the spectrum to the next end of the spectrum.
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.500]   That's called a merism.
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.500]   Alpha, Omega, Heaven and the Earth, from morning to dawn, all that kind of stuff.
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.500]   All that's saying is this.
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.500]   Everything.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:45.500]   From your going out, whether you're going out from the home, from the protection of here, or when you're here.
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:53.500]   Regardless of what time, what day, or what it is, every single thing, God is guarding you.
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:58.500]   So, again, don't ever think, "Oh, this is too trivial to pray about."
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.500]   Absolutely not. God is watching that.
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:05.500]   "This is too big of something. I don't even know what to ask God for."
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.500]   Well, ask.
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.500]   God is watching everything from your going out to your coming in.
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:14.500]   That is just to say every aspect of your life.
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.500]   The Lord is in control.
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.500]   So Mike, I ask you that question again.
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.500]   Who are you looking to? Who do you believe is able?
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.500]   And it's God.
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.500]   The Creator.
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.500]   The One who is your Good Shepherd.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.500]   The One who is your Good Guard.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.500]   The Savior and Keeper of your soul.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.500]   He is fully capable because He watches everything.
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.500]   Amen?
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.500]   He watches everything.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:44.500]   So before we move forward, I hope, when you hear this, that you could say with your faith,
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.500]   "Yes, I believe God is able.
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.500]   Completely capable.
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.500]   He is powerful."
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:57.500]   And I hope that not just by me saying it to you, but by experience of encountering God,
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:05.500]   by you actually having asked, and then feeling and knowing and experiencing and encountering the sufficient God,
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:11.500]   you would be able to say from experience, "My help comes from God."
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.500]   Right?
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.500]   Because that's what's going to set you apart from all the other pagans.
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.500]   We needed help before we were saved.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:23.500]   But as a Christian, and from you saying from experience and encountering God, "My Lord helps me."
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.500]   That's your testimony.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.500]   Let's look further here.
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.500]   I'm going to read all of verse 8 again.
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:39.500]   "The Lord will guard your going out and your coming in, from this time forth and forevermore."
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:43.500]   From this time forth and forevermore.
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.500]   If there is a verse for you to highlight in this chapter, that's it.
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.500]   Underline it. Star it. Put a little arrow. Put a happy face.
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:59.500]   Whatever it is you do, He is going to keep your soul from here forth and forever.
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:08.500]   You see, even a good parent, I look at Bia, and I'm just so proud of her and the way that she is taking care of our baby.
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:14.500]   But even on her best day, if he is fussy and he is just so hard to deal with,
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:24.500]   even the best parent on their best day, will one of these days say, "Give me a break. I'm so glad you're home."
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.500]   Hand off.
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:33.500]   Because for us, our patience, our ability is so limited.
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.500]   What am I saying here?
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:40.500]   When the Lord God says, "I will keep you forevermore,"
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.500]   that, my friends, is the doctrine of eternal security.
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:49.500]   It's both the perseverance of the saints, it's the permanence of your salvation.
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.500]   How important is that?
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.500]   And how amazing is it when the Lord says, "I keep you forever."
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.500]   It's not like us.
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:03.500]   Even though I want to, I am so limited.
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.500]   But the Lord is not.
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.500]   He says, "Forevermore."
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.500]   This doctrine, guys, is so important.
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.500]   And we want to hear this from Jesus Himself.
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.500]   Turn over to John 6.
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:19.500]   This doctrine, I think, is, I would say, in terms of our salvation,
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.500]   the doctrines of our salvation, this is up there.
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.500]   I might even say this is the most important.
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.500]   And you might be like, "Oh, more important than justification?"
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.500]   Well, if we didn't have this, I don't know about justification.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.500]   If we didn't have this, I don't know about sanctification.
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:37.500]   If we didn't have this, all the things intertwined about God's character is now all aloof.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:44.500]   This doctrine that God can keep you forever is so crucial.
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.500]   And we're going to hear it from Jesus' own words.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.500]   If you've ever doubted whether God can keep you to the very end,
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.500]   if you've ever asked yourself that question,
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:56.500]   if someone's a genuine believer and he's saved, can he ever be unsaved?
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.500]   Can he ever lose his salvation?
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.500]   Look what Jesus says.
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.500]   John 6, verse 39.
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.500]   John 6, verse 39.
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.500]   "This is the will of Him who sent Me,
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.500]   that of all that He has given Me, I lose nothing,
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.500]   but raise it up on the last day.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.500]   For this is the will of My Father,
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:21.500]   that everyone who holds the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life.
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:28.500]   And I Myself will raise him up on that last day."
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.500]   I bet you, for almost all of you here,
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.500]   we just went through the Psalms and said,
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.500]   "I want to convince you that God is able to protect you,
[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.500]   that God is able to keep you."
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.500]   And all of you I can see nodding.
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.500]   I believe all of you guys here generally believe God is powerful.
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.500]   But here's what else.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.500]   I think a lot of you guys believe God is able,
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:52.500]   but you question whether God is willing.
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.500]   Because it goes against your experience.
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.500]   "Well, I know God is going to protect me with my physical needs,
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.500]   all of the things that I need to care for, and my spiritual needs,
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.500]   but I am struggling."
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.500]   A lot of times we wrestle with this idea,
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.500]   "I know God is fully capable,
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.500]   but I don't know if He's willing."
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.500]   Let this verse reassure you.
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.500]   It says, "It is the will of My Father.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.500]   It is His will that whatever is in His hands will not be lost.
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:25.500]   He Himself is going to keep you until that very last day."
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.500]   Let that give you peace.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.500]   Let that give you reassurance.
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.500]   I know we experience difficulty.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.500]   I know we experience that kind of weariness in which we just want to sigh
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.500]   because we can't do nothing about it.
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.500]   But the thing is,
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.500]   Christ Himself says, "I lose nothing."
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.500]   Go over to chapter 10.
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:50.500]   Let us reemphasize this fact.
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.500]   John 10.27
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.500]   He says this,
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.500]   "My sheep hear My voice, and I know them,
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.500]   and they follow Me,
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.500]   and I give eternal life to them,
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.500]   and they will never perish,
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.500]   and no one will snatch them out of My hand.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.500]   My Father, who has given them to Me,
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.500]   is greater than all,
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.500]   and no one is able to snatch them from out of the Father's hand.
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.500]   I and the Father are one."
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.500]   So here it is.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.500]   If you think ever that God is going to lose one of you,
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.500]   that is preponderance.
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.500]   That is ridiculous.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.500]   You were lost and God found you.
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.500]   He's never going to lose you again.
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.500]   Right?
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.500]   Not only that, but God says, "I have you in My hand."
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.500]   If someone were ever to try and take you,
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.500]   they would have to go through the entire Trinity.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.500]   God and the Son are one.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.500]   They will lose nothing.
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:45.500]   None of you will fall through the cracks of His fingers.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.500]   There is none of you that He is going to lose.
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.500]   In Hebrews, you don't have to turn there, chapter 7,
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.500]   it goes to this elaborate explanation
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:57.500]   that Christ is the High Priest, eternal.
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.500]   And so Hebrews 7, verse 24 and 25, do you know what it says?
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.500]   Because He is the Priest eternal,
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:06.500]   He is able to save forever.
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.500]   Forever.
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:13.500]   So I'm emphasizing to you this doctrine.
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:18.500]   When God says, "I will keep you," in Psalm 121,
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.500]   and He says, "I'll keep you forever,"
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:25.500]   He means it and it will happen just that way.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.500]   Salvation is permanent.
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.500]   No one who is in God's fold,
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.500]   no one who is a member of His kingdom,
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:34.500]   will be lost.
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.500]   And you can bank on that.
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.500]   And why is that so important?
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.500]   Why am I saying it is so vital to the Christian gospel?
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.500]   Because of this.
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.500]   What is the gospel?
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.500]   The gospel is going to say,
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.500]   "You, by being a sinner, you're bankrupt.
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.500]   You've got nothing.
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.500]   You can do nothing to save yourself
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.500]   because you're absolutely dead.
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:01.500]   As a sinner, you are damned to judgment."
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.500]   So what is the gospel?
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.500]   "Then make yourself vulnerable to God
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.500]   and surrender at His feet because Christ died for you.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.500]   And you can see God as your Lord.
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.500]   Obey Him with everything.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.500]   Obey Him to the point in which you'd be willing to suffer.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.500]   Leave your hometown.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.500]   Leave your family.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.500]   Whatever it may be, surrender and sacrifice.
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.500]   All carry that cross and go to Him."
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.500]   Now let me tell you something.
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:27.500]   If at the end of that, He says,
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.500]   "But I can't promise you,
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.500]   I can't promise you that I'm just, you know,
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.500]   I can't.
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.500]   I can't promise you you'll be there though."
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.500]   It's like, "What?"
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.500]   I'm going to make myself vulnerable to you,
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.500]   confess you as my Lord,
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.500]   make myself vulnerable to the Christian community,
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.500]   and in the end you say,
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.500]   "Well, you could probably lose it."
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.500]   It's kind of like Pastor Aaron was preaching this
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.500]   in the Bible studies.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.500]   Abraham was giving a lot of promises.
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.500]   God said, "I'm going to give you land.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.500]   I will bless you with offspring.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.500]   I'm going to bless the nations through you."
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.500]   And Abraham said, "How will I know, Lord,
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.500]   that you're going to do this?"
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.500]   Well, Abraham, I don't give out guarantees.
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.500]   You know?
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.500]   It's all part of business.
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.500]   I can't give you guarantees.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.500]   What is that?
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.500]   Could anybody take the Gospel call
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.500]   if there was no promise
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.500]   of a permanent salvation
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:26.500]   in which God guarantees?
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.500]   The reason why I'm emphasizing this so much,
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.500]   the reason why I'm pushing this,
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.500]   and why I'm saying it is so vital
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:34.500]   to the Christian Gospel,
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.500]   is because if God does not keep us,
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.500]   then who will?
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:41.500]   Let me put it in another way.
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.500]   If you could lose your salvation,
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.500]   even if you took the Gospel call
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.500]   to surrender and sacrifice,
[00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.500]   if you could lose it, you will.
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.500]   Because you're a sinner, and I'm a sinner.
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.500]   You're fallen, I'm fallen.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.500]   If you could lose it, you would.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.500]   If God doesn't keep us, who's going to keep us?
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.500]   There is no hope.
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.500]   God sanctified me.
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.500]   God's going to sanctify me.
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.500]   And God's going to glorify me.
[00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.500]   All of that, all three aspects of that,
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.500]   that's salvation, right?
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.500]   Well, am I so ridiculous to think,
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.500]   well, God sanctifies me,
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.500]   I mean, God justifies me, sanctifies me,
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.500]   but glorifies me in the end,
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.500]   I'll make sure that happens.
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.500]   That's ridiculous.
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.500]   I'm preponderance.
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.500]   I cannot keep myself.
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:33.500]   If God wanted to, any moment,
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.500]   He says, "By forgiveness and mercy,
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.500]   I will not remember your transgressions."
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.500]   But if He wanted to,
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.500]   He could make a list of my transgressions so long,
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.500]   if it was a scroll, it would just roll right off the street
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:49.500]   and through the streets, right?
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.500]   He could bring up any one of those accusations.
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:55.500]   "Mark, I saw you over here so prideful."
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.500]   You can't go into heaven.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.500]   Actually, Satan.
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.500]   Satan can bring up accusations against me.
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.500]   "I saw you here, lusting over the world."
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.500]   "I saw you here, materialistic."
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:11.500]   "I saw you here, complaining and griping to God."
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.500]   Well, actually, if you come to think of it,
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.500]   you could.
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.500]   Any one of you who've known me for more than a year or two
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.500]   could bring up accusations against me
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.500]   and tell me why I'm not sufficient to get into heaven,
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.500]   why I'm not sufficient to obtain salvation.
[00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.500]   So how would I so foolishly think
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.500]   I could keep myself to the very end?
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:33.500]   If God doesn't keep me, nobody can.
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.500]   And for sure I can't.
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.500]   Right?
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.500]   So to me,
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.500]   the promise of God in Psalm 121,
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.500]   where He says, "I keep you forever,"
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.500]   I cling to that with everything.
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.500]   That refreshes my soul.
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.500]   That completely satisfies me.
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.500]   And if I'm weary, if I'm even in sin,
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.500]   that revives me to think, "Oh my Lord,
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.500]   "You are both willing and capable to keep me."
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.500]   So I ask You to help me with my struggles.
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.500]   And I worship You more because You keep me to the very end.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.500]   I know I can't do anything. I know You can.
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.500]   How amazing is that?
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.500]   And that's why, friends, we here at Berean,
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.500]   we really don't hold to that Armenian theology
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:23.500]   in which they believe that the freedom of man isn't touched.
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.500]   And so if a man has the freedom to believe,
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.500]   he also has the freedom to not believe.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.500]   The problem with that is it makes sin all the more or less,
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:36.500]   you all the more greater, and God impotent.
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:41.500]   Because God says, "I have the power to keep you forever."
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.500]   That's true.
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.500]   That is true.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:50.500]   Guys, when I am afraid, and I have anxiety,
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.500]   trust me, now that I have a baby,
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.500]   I have all kinds of anxiety.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.500]   I'm like, "Man, is our house big enough?"
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.500]   It's like, "Man, all of this stuff,
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.500]   "are we going to have enough for X, Y, and Z?"
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.500]   I've got all kinds of insecurities.
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.500]   When you have that kind of insecurities, who do you look to?
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.500]   Who do you look to?
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:12.500]   I hope you can look to the Lord and say,
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:15.500]   "I can trust because I am in God's hands."
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.500]   Like Daniel, I can say, "Even if I burn,
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.500]   "I am safe in the hands of God."
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:23.500]   Regardless of circumstance, I am safe in the hand of God.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.500]   So even if it's the common struggles of man,
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.500]   even if it's something very trivial,
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.500]   even if it's something you feel like,
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:32.500]   "Well, I can take care of this on my own by hard work,"
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.500]   because everybody experiences this kind of hardship in life.
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:39.500]   Regardless, look to the Lord and have strength.
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:44.500]   But also, if you are afraid because perhaps you're in sin,
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:49.500]   perhaps you've been discouraged because of your own sin.
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.500]   Young people often ask me,
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:57.500]   "Man, this is going to be a lifetime struggle.
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:01.500]   "When am I going to ever overcome sin?"
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.500]   I have good news and bad news.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.500]   Good news is the Holy God, when you spend more time with Him,
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.500]   you will sin less frequently.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.500]   The bad news is when you spend more time with the Holy God,
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.500]   your sin looks really, really bad,
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.500]   and you feel really, really bad.
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.500]   So I have actually seen this kind of tendency in growing Christians,
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.500]   or people who've been Christians for a very long time.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.500]   They know how bad sin is, but they fail.
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.500]   When they fail, they fail again to look to God for help.
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:36.500]   Do you know what happens when an individual who sees the depth of their sin,
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:41.500]   who feels the guilt but has a difficult time looking to the Lord,
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:46.500]   that's when despair, discouragement, and a desire to quit starts to settle in.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.500]   Does that make sense?
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.500]   You need, especially if you've been Christian for some time,
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.500]   and you're wrestling with some kind of sin,
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.500]   you need to go to the Lord who says,
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:38:00.500]   "I am the one who protects you from evil and evil within you.
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:06.500]   The sins that are within you, I deal with and clean you and protect you."
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:10.500]   You need to go to the Lord with that and find that kind of strength.
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.500]   The Lord will give me strength to overcome sin.
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:19.500]   The Lord will be there, present, right hand, right there, readily available.
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:24.500]   And there are some of you, there are some of you, I don't doubt,
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.500]   that have questioned whether you are a believer or not.
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:30.500]   Right? I'm pretty sure there are.
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:35.500]   There are some of you who have failed in some way or another
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.500]   where you believe, "I don't think God is going to approve of me.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:41.500]   How in the world is God going to receive me?
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.500]   How in the world is God going to accept me?"
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.500]   Now, I'm not going to say, "Oh, the Lord keeps everybody and saves everybody."
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.500]   But this is what I'm going to say.
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.500]   The Lord is sovereign. The Lord is sovereign.
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:57.500]   Furthermore, His forgiveness when He gives it is His prerogative.
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.500]   What am I saying?
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.500]   Because the Lord is our keeper, He says,
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:06.500]   "Anybody who confesses and repents in genuineness, I forgive."
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.500]   That forgiveness is His prerogative.
[00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:13.500]   So for you to sit there and say, "Oh, the Lord is not going to approve me.
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.500]   Oh, He's not going to receive me.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:19.500]   I'd rather just spend my life outside of the church, outside of His realm."
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.500]   His forgiveness is His prerogative to give.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:28.500]   If He says, "Your sin," and says, "I can forgive that," then He can forgive that.
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.500]   So the question for you is not sitting there reconciling,
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.500]   "Oh, what's my responsibility? What's His responsibility?
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.500]   Is He going to receive me? Is He not going to receive me?" and all of this.
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:42.500]   The question for you is, can you come to a point where you humble yourself and repent?
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:47.500]   Can you come to a point where you humble yourself and say, "God, I need you desperately."
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.500]   For any of you who are sitting there wrestling,
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.500]   anytime someone preaches, "Oh, God keeps you to the very end.
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.500]   He's the one who's working in you. He's the one who's convicting you.
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.500]   He's the one who's got the Spirit in you.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.500]   And He's the one fully controlling you to the very end."
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.500]   You want to ask all those questions of, "Well, what's the reconciliation here
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:08.500]   between my responsibility and the Lord's sovereignty?"
[00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:14.500]   I just want to tell you guys, "Shh. Put that off until later."
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:19.500]   The issue here isn't whether you want to reconcile your responsibility and His responsibility.
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:26.500]   The issue here is God just told you that He is willing and capable of keeping you.
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:34.500]   Will you apply that in faith? Will you apply that in faith?
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.500]   Please turn back over to Psalms.
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.500]   And again, these are songs of ascent, so if you ever have time,
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:45.500]   start reading from Psalm 120 and go 15 chapters forward.
[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:49.500]   But I want to show you Psalm 123.
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:53.500]   It is the spiritual thought as we move from fears and failures
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:59.500]   to the thought and belief that God is supreme, that God will keep us.
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:02.500]   We go to Psalm 123.
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:08.500]   "To you I lift up my eyes, O you who are enthroned in the heavens.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:12.500]   Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters,
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:16.500]   as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress,
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:22.500]   so our eyes look to the Lord our God until He is gracious to us.
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:27.500]   Be gracious to us, O Lord, be gracious to us."
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:34.500]   I pray for you guys that today as you leave, you would be all the more assured in faith,
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:40.500]   "My God is able to help me. My God is willing to help me."
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:46.500]   And that belief, I hope it empowers your prayer life.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.500]   If you are struggling with giving God worship through the week,
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.500]   I hope this empowers your prayer life.
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.500]   For you can go to Him with everything.
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:59.500]   "Lord, this is not too small in your eyes. I can go to you for help.
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:02.500]   Lord, this is not too big for you to deal with.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:07.500]   I don't even know how to ask for help here, God. I just need you to intervene."
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:13.500]   Let this rejuvenate and empower your prayer life through this week.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.500]   And that you can go to God and say, "Lord, be gracious to me.
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:22.500]   As a servant who is watchfully waiting for the master to say, 'Come,' or the masters to say, 'Here,'
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:28.500]   I want you guys to say, 'I look and lift my eyes to the Lord.'"
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:32.500]   Let's pray.
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:45.500]   Heavenly Father, there are times in our Christian walk
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:53.500]   where all we can do is tell you, "Lord, I believe. Thank you so much."
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:43:00.500]   These are one of those moments when we know that our eternal security is in your hands.
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.500]   And so when you promise, "I am your keeper to the very end,"
