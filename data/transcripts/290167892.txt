[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   All right, let me pray for us and then we'll start.
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.280]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you for this evening.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.960]   Help us, Lord God, to glean from your Word, especially, Lord God, in the book of Leviticus.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.040]   There's so many things in here that are hard to understand at times, but we know, Father,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.780]   from what we already have studied, just how important this is to our understanding of
[00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.460]   what you have been doing in preparing, Father God, for the coming of Christ.
[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.480]   Help us to know the depth of what it is that you have done, what it is that we have, that
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.260]   we may have a greater hope, Lord God, for what is coming.
[00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.300]   We pray that your Word would teach us.
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.640]   Pray, Father God, that you would help me not to speak of things, Lord God, that is not
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:02.820]   from you, that I would only be a vessel, Father, that you can use to let your words go out.
[00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.200]   Help us to understand your Word.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.640]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:16.920]   All right, so today, again, in this second part of the chiasm, talking about the ritual
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.920]   holiness of the priests.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.240]   So there's two parts to it.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.800]   There's the first part that's talking about the general priest that's pertaining to all
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.760]   the priests, and then the second part of it starting from verse 10 to 15 is talking specifically
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.280]   for high priests.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.080]   And so the high calling of priesthood that is mentioned in this text.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.100]   So again, the general subject here, obviously, is about the importance of leadership and
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.680]   how they are set apart for His service.
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.960]   So there are requirements for all people who are entering into the tabernacle, but it's
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.440]   specifically for people who have been called to represent God as priests and to high priests.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.920]   There's extra qualifications that they needed to be above reproach, according to the New
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.080]   Testament, in order for them to not defile themselves, to be able to be in service to
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.080]   God.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.560]   I want to read a passage.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.520]   Again, I think it is so important.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:21.480]   It's a little bit smaller than I was hoping, but when you talk about the health of the
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.120]   church, before we look at the congregation, before we look at the generation or the method
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.320]   or anything else we look at, first we have to look at the leadership.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.160]   And again, as one of the leaders of the church, I know the weightiness of what it means to
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.360]   be called a pastor or an elder or any type of leadership in the church.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.440]   This is not something that you should take lightly.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.160]   A lot of times we don't consider the weightiness or what it means to be a leader until you
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.080]   actually become a leader, and then you begin to see the consequences of it.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.120]   The New Testament and the Old Testament warns very harshly that whenever Israel strayed
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.520]   away from God, the first people that God points out that was responsible for Israel's sin
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.580]   were always the leaders.
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.600]   Before they rebuke the idolatry, before they rebuke sexual immorality, they said all of
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.160]   this happened because the shepherds weren't shepherding.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.960]   The leaders were being selfish.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.680]   There are people who are in the position that should not have been there.
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.600]   Jeremiah 14, 14, 15, it says, "Then the Lord said to me, 'The prophets are prophesying
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.200]   falsehood in my name.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.880]   I have neither sent them nor commanded them nor spoken to them.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.240]   They are prophesying to you a false vision, divination, futility, deception of their own
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.240]   minds.'"
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.240]   Okay.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.280]   So you notice how it says all these false things are happening, and one of the things
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.720]   that they say is that they themselves are deceived, and that's why false teachings
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.720]   coming out.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.520]   "Therefore, it says, 'The Lord concerned the prophets who were prophesying in my name.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.080]   Although it was not I who sent them, yet they keep saying, 'There will be no sword or famine
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.160]   in this land.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.760]   By sword or famine, those prophets shall meet their end.'"
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.760]   So obviously the message that they were continuing to convey was that God is pleased with you,
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.640]   and so the reason why the false prophets are saying these things is because no one wants
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.720]   to hear that God is angry with Israel because He's calling them out to judgment.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.040]   He's calling them out to repentance.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.820]   So if He is preaching not on behalf of God, but He's preaching in order to tickle man's
[00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.600]   ears to gain the favor of man, He has to say things that are favorable to the man that
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.400]   He is preaching to.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.120]   And so again, in Jeremiah, again the rebuke first goes to the false prophet.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.840]   Jeremiah 23, 21, "I did not send these prophets, but they ran.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.320]   I did not speak to them, but they prophesied.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.960]   But if they had stood in my counsel, then they would have announced my words to my people
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.680]   and would have turned them back from their evil way and from evil of their own."
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.800]   So again, if these were my prophets, they would have spoken my words to my people, right?
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.760]   Finally, Ezekiel 34, one through two, just a couple of verses.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.800]   "Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, 'Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.160]   of Israel.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.560]   Prophesy and say to these shepherds, 'Thus says the Lord God, "Woe, shepherds of Israel,
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.620]   who have been feeding themselves!
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.200]   Should not the shepherds feed the flock?"'"
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:19.160]   So again, one of the problems with the shepherds were they were first concerned about themselves,
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.920]   concerned about themselves, their family, their children, and they weren't concerned
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.500]   enough about the nation of Israel.
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.760]   So therefore, he says, the judgment is going to first come upon the nation.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.560]   I can give you passage after passage in the Old Testament and the New Testament why the
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.660]   calling for leadership in the Old Testament and New Testament is a very, very high calling.
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.940]   Because the consequence of someone who is in leadership that is not speaking for God,
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.960]   that is not right with God, that is living self-centered instead of God-centered, is
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.080]   going to have dire consequence in the church.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.840]   And so before we look at the health of anything else, before we look at anything else that's
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.880]   going on in the church, we have to first and foremost make sure that if we want a healthy
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.600]   church we need to have healthy leadership.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.920]   This principle is not a New Testament principle.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.280]   This is a principle that is embedded into Israel's culture.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:21.640]   Again, so that's why for me, I understand the weight of being in a position where I
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.720]   have to preach every week because everything that I say, everything I do has more weight.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:35.560]   And so when I am tempted to sin, I am burdened by the fact that my sins have greater consequence.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.320]   And it's not just me.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.320]   Anybody who's in leadership.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.880]   That's why it says in James that not many should seek to be in leadership.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.240]   To be in leadership and not to be right with God, not only do you bring sin upon yourself,
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.640]   but you bring sin upon your family and the church.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.880]   And I can't emphasize this enough because that's how it's emphasized in the New Testament.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.180]   If the church is going to be healthy, the leadership has to be healthy.
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:12.360]   That as a base, chapter 21 is the weightiness of the calling of the priests.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.320]   Priests are held to a higher standard than other Israelites for two specific reasons.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.680]   One, the first, the Lord called them to serve in a special role, representing God to the
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.960]   people and people to God.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:33.520]   Secondly, the priests were to model not only ritual purity, but also moral purity to the
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.960]   rest of Israel.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.240]   Because a priest was meant to stand between God and man.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.840]   So if he is corrupted in any way, he's not going to be able to convey the holy God to
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.640]   the people.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.360]   And neither will he be able to represent the people to God.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.560]   Because he's not, how can a man represent people to God when he himself is not able
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.280]   to get to God?
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:05.920]   So for those two reasons, the standard for the priest was above the rest of the congregation.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.720]   In Luke chapter 12, 48, it says, "For everyone who has been given much, much will be required.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.080]   And to whom they entrusted much of him, they will ask all the more."
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:21.440]   Again, in James 3, "Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, knowing that
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.080]   as such we will incur stricter judgment."
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.560]   So this is not just something that, you know, leadership in the church in any capacity,
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:36.480]   in particular people who are going to become elders or going into a full-time role as pastors,
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.520]   these are not something that you should just kind of think and say, "You know what?
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.820]   I think I like teaching, so I'm going to become a pastor."
[00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.420]   It says, "Think very carefully, make sure confirmation is there, and look at and examine
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:56.280]   your own life, and to take it very, very seriously."
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:03.520]   Verses 1 through 9 is a requirement for the general priesthood.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.160]   As we mentioned before, the meaning of holiness is not simply to be morally holy, but to be
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.480]   set apart.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.760]   So they are to be moral, obviously, they are to keep all the commandments of God that
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:21.320]   Moses gave, but they are also to be set apart in ritual cleansing, above and beyond.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:27.840]   So he's already given instructions on what they are required to do, and more instructions
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.040]   are coming to the general congregation.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.400]   But before we even get to that, he qualifies specifically, these are qualifications that
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:42.200]   are extra specific to the priesthood.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.960]   In the following verses, he talks about mourning.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.840]   Now he's not talking about taking vacation, he's not talking about frivolous spending,
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:57.180]   he's talking about when a death occurs in the community, the death of an immediate family
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:02.760]   member could call him away from the duties only.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:09.880]   The priest, because if he spends any time in the presence of, again, someone who is
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:14.440]   dead, in Numbers chapter 19 through 11, he will be considered unclean for seven days.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.840]   That means for seven days, he would not be able to carry out his duties.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:30.720]   So the only exception that was given to him, the only exception given to him was only if
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.560]   it's a father, mother, son, daughter, or brother, or a virgin sister.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.580]   And those are the only ones, right?
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:44.640]   Only if one of them passed away that they were given a period to mourn.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.560]   And then they would have to go through ritual cleansing and then come back.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:52.640]   In any other case, they were not to participate in the ceremonies that would consider them
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.640]   unclean.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:59.780]   They are not to mourn like the pagans, by shaving their heads or the edges of their
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.880]   beards or make any cuts to their flesh.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:07.000]   And all of these things were cultural things that represented signs of mourning.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.800]   And they said, "You're not allowed to be like the rest of the people who can participate
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.360]   in the form of mourning, only if it is your immediate family," and those people that
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.200]   he made sure.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:25.480]   In other words, in every other instance, their duty as a priest takes priority.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.360]   You can't be like everybody else.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.580]   And that's basically what he is saying to these priests.
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:39.700]   You have to be set apart and make your duty your first priority.
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.900]   Verse six gives a reason for the call.
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.220]   Why does he say that?
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.680]   And he repeats this several times in this text.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.280]   The verse begins and ends to be holy.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.560]   Verse six says, "They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God,
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.880]   for they present the offerings by fire to the Lord, the food of their God, so they shall
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.880]   be holy."
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.160]   And you notice how many times he says that in verse six.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.520]   "You are to be holy, not to profane the name of God," and then it ends, "so that you may
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.160]   be holy."
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:12.120]   And the whole reason why is because they are on duty.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:17.800]   Because they engage in presenting sacrifices to God, they must be kept holy as not to prevent
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.500]   them from their duties.
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:28.840]   Not only are they called to be holy, he said, "The wife of the priest also affect the holy
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.960]   holiness of the priest, dedicated it to the Lord's work."
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.280]   Verse seven.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:42.520]   The wife must also be holy by not having practiced harlotry in the past or have been divorced.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:50.580]   So not only is not, it wasn't enough for the man himself to be kept ritually clean.
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:55.920]   The wife that he chooses, again, there's qualifications for that.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.240]   Because if he chooses the wrong wife, he may be disqualified for the priesthood.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:07.520]   Again, in verse eight, it emphasizes again the reason for the special dedication.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.400]   Again, he says basically the same thing he says in verse six.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.040]   It's for the purpose so that he may be set apart to serve the Lord.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.840]   So not only does he need to be set apart, the wife that he chooses also needs to be
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.440]   in accordance to his calling.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.640]   You can't have a husband who's called and said, "Well, that's my husband's duty, but
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.640]   that's not mine."
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.640]   Right?
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:35.000]   He says the ritual cleansing and the purity, his wife also affects the husband.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.800]   The daughter of the priest also affect the holiness of the priest, dedicated to the Lord.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:45.560]   Verse nine, it says, "Also the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by harlotry,
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.640]   she profanes her father.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:56.680]   But because of her sin, her father is also defiled and shall be burned with fire."
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:03.320]   So her sins also affect the husband.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.540]   She must not profane herself by harlotry.
[00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:10.880]   The penalty for this violation, again, is burning with fire.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.360]   Now, again, we see this reflected in the New Testament.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.560]   We see the qualifications of an elder.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.600]   We see it in First Timothy in Titus chapter one, verse six.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.520]   In fact, I think I have these verses.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.520]   Right?
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:28.520]   First Timothy three, four, it says, "He, an elder, must be one who manages his own household
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.040]   well, keeping his children under control with all dignity."
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.040]   Okay, this is one of the qualifications of an elder.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.840]   Again, Titus one, six, "Namely, if any man is above reproach, the husband of one wife,
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.440]   having children who believe, not accused of dissipation or rebellion."
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.440]   Okay?
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.180]   So again, this is not a New Testament concept.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.080]   We see this even in the Old Testament.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:54.320]   That, again, we live in a very individualistic society, like my sin is my sin.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.440]   It doesn't affect anybody else.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.640]   So we don't have this concept of community.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.640]   Right?
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.140]   I mean, we do, but it's not like the New Testament.
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:07.900]   If you go to Japan or some of the Asian countries, there is a very strong sense that what I do
[00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:12.640]   affect my parents, it affects my brothers, it affects my family, maybe even my company.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:18.820]   There's a very strong sense of community, that my action is not private, it is not alone.
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.500]   We just happen to live in a society where we're at the other extreme.
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:28.020]   We're individual, it's just us, it doesn't affect anybody else.
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:32.940]   But that is not the culture we see in the Old Testament or the New Testament.
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:37.380]   And so I'm not going to get into the details of this because I know some questions may
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.380]   come up.
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:43.960]   I know elders who have unbelieving children, and so there are some churches that will say,
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:48.160]   if you have unbelieving children, you know, who are adults and they don't believe that
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.440]   that disqualifies you as an elder, and then obviously there are arguments.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.680]   I'm not going to get into that.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.260]   We may talk about that maybe in private if you have questions about that.
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:08.880]   But that idea of believing children or obedient children who are submissive as a quality of
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.880]   an elder, again, is not a New Testament concept.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.880]   It's an Old Testament.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.200]   That the daughter's sin affects the father.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:25.040]   Verses 10 through 15 is a call to complete dedication to the high priest.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.900]   How many high priests are there?
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.100]   One at a time, right?
[00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.460]   There's only one at a time.
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:36.980]   So this whole section, five verses, is dedicated to that one man, right?
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.100]   So he is the leader among the priests.
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.180]   He's the one who represents all the other priests.
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:47.740]   So the quality that he is called for is even beyond the regular priest, right?
[00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.860]   Uncovering his head or tearing his clothes signified great sorrow and anguish.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.640]   So there was nothing sinful about it.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:17:02.340]   But he was not allowed to do that because, remember in the earlier chapters of Leviticus,
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:07.980]   that God went into detail about the clothing of the priest and specific for the high priest?
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:12.480]   So whenever you see the language in the New Testament about tearing clothes or putting
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:18.700]   new garments on, all of this is related to the high priest's garments, right?
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:23.500]   It's being set apart and taking your old garments off, putting new garments on for the purpose
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.900]   of worshiping, right?
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.860]   So that imagery is given in the book of Leviticus.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:37.980]   So when he says not to take off your, to uncover yourself to be bald and not to rip your clothes,
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:44.340]   he's basically talking about keeping your garments on for the purpose of service, right?
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.980]   As a high priest, he is never to do that.
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:52.040]   He is not to mourn like everybody else.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.660]   They were not to approach any dead person with no exception, even for father or mother,
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.840]   verse 11, right?
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:03.220]   So the priests were actually, they're given stipulation only for father, mother, daughter,
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.020]   son, and virgin sister.
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:10.020]   But for the high priest, verse 11, nor shall he approach any dead person nor defile himself,
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.560]   even for his father or his mother.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:17.240]   He couldn't even go to his mother or father's funeral, right?
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:22.680]   I mean, that's how high of a calling the high priesthood was, right?
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.920]   Once he put on the garment, he was not allowed to function like everybody else, right?
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.880]   He said, "Well, I'm just human," right?
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:35.120]   I mean, maybe they can protest that, but that's how high this calling was.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:40.720]   However, he spent the whole section in the first part of Leviticus to demonstrate and
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.000]   to teach how holy God is.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.920]   First two priests who come to him, they don't follow the rules and offer up strange fire.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.160]   They are immediately put to death.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:59.840]   He wanted the nation of Israel to know you cannot approach God by your standards, on
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.440]   your terms.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:07.840]   So the priest who represented mankind must come to him also on his terms.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:13.680]   And the priest who represented all the other priests must absolutely submit to his terms
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.680]   with no exception.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.480]   He said, "Not even for father and mother."
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.080]   That's how high of a calling this was.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.680]   All of this is to convey how far God is to us.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:33.680]   All of this is to convey his holiness, right?
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:39.320]   They're not to leave the sanctuary and by doing so profane or defile it.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.120]   He's not saying that they can never leave the sanctuary.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.600]   It's not like the high priest would never be out of the sanctuary.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.160]   He's saying for the purpose of mourning, right?
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:56.080]   Even father or mother, he had to be on duty, right?
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:05.600]   He is not to defile himself for any reason.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:21.960]   So verse...
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:26.160]   The priest must be dedicated even in the way he chooses his wife.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:32.080]   So look at verse 13 through 15 and then look at verse...
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:37.680]   I think it was verse 8.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:42.480]   No.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:50.200]   Read verse 7 and read verse 13 to 15.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.680]   Tell me if you can notice a difference.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:59.080]   Verse 7 is qualification for the wife of the priest and then verse 13 to 15 is qualification
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.800]   for the wife of the high priest.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:08.560]   What do you notice?
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:14.880]   What is an extra command that's given to the high priest?
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:20.160]   Okay, so all the things are the same but he added on top of that, she had to be a widow.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.880]   Oh, she couldn't be a widow.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:27.440]   So anyone who's been married for any reason, even if she was widowed, the high priest,
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:33.840]   again, talk about one man, he could not marry her, right?
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:39.780]   She must not be a widow or divorce or have practiced harlotry at any time.
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:45.480]   So the other two qualities were also told to the priest but for the high priest, she
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.800]   can't even be a widow, right?
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.920]   Maybe she has sympathy for her and falls in love with somebody who's husband has died.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.060]   She has every right to remarry.
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:22:01.560]   He has every right to marry her under the Jewish law but the high priest could not.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:07.360]   She must be a virgin in order not to profane his offering among his people.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:14.520]   He wanted to make sure that one high priest, that there was no confusion as to his ancestry,
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.520]   where he came from.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.440]   So he wanted to keep that line pure.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:22.580]   So as a result of that, he said the qualification for a high priest, that it must be a virgin
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:31.080]   so there's absolutely no question as to his ancestry.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:37.480]   This is because the next generation of priests would come from the offspring of this marriage,
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:43.640]   as I already mentioned.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:48.720]   So up to this point, he's talking about the very high calling of priests, very very high
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.400]   calling of the high priest and then he said these are the qualities starting from verse
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.160]   16 to 24 that will disqualify you.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:01.100]   Now if you'll notice, none of these qualities are moral qualities.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:06.960]   In fact, every one of these qualities are qualities that we would show sympathy for.
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:13.520]   If in our generation, we discriminated against somebody who was handicapped, was born with,
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:19.200]   you know, shorter legs or for whatever the reason, have some kind of deformity, we are
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.400]   called in the New Testament to highlight that and show special favor, to be merciful and
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.400]   gracious.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:33.520]   But starting from verse 16 and 24, he says no man with any defect can be set apart as
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.040]   a priest.
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:42.680]   So if you have a child and the child is born blind, he's disqualified.
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:46.760]   He can't serve as a priest.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:54.760]   If he has one leg, has a disfigured face, so here's all the things that are mentioned.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:24:00.840]   I mean, think about how hard life would be just being blind, but because he's blind,
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.680]   he can't be a priest.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.000]   He's lame.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.760]   Whether you were lame by birth or lame because you got in an accident, in either case, this
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.960]   is not who is lame by choice.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.440]   There's a horrible accident happened or it was a tragic thing that happened when he was
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.080]   born, but as a result of that, he can't be a priest.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:26.000]   He can't serve, even if he is born a Levite.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:33.660]   A disfigured face, a deformed limb, a broken foot or hand, a hunchback or dwarf, or one
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.840]   who has defect in his eye or even eczema.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.720]   You have skin disease and that's considered a defect enough to disqualify you as a priest.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.920]   Or, crushed testicles.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.920]   Very specific.
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:59.320]   I mean, in my mind, I'm thinking, "Man, this guy has hard enough life as it is."
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:03.800]   On top of that, he's disqualified.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:09.720]   I mean, think about how cruel this may seem.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:16.560]   Especially, I mean, I don't know any culture, at least that I know of, that wouldn't show
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.800]   sympathy to people.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:25.520]   Yet, in the Old Testament, in the Levitical law, it says they are disqualified because
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.520]   they are defective.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.920]   Now, these are not moral qualities.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.240]   It's not because they sinned.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.720]   It's not because their parents sinned.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.920]   It's just unfortunate.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:40.040]   They're all born sinners and yet these people have extra consequences because of their deformity
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.960]   of some kind.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:49.360]   So the natural question, or before that, so this is not saying that he can't participate
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.960]   in giving worship to God.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:59.880]   They're just saying that this disqualifies him as a priest to serve in the tabernacle.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:04.800]   So the natural question that you should be asking, if you read this and you say, "Oh,
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:10.280]   of course, chrostesical, they shouldn't be priests."
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.640]   I don't think anybody sitting here is thinking that.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.720]   If you are, you're a weirdo.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:24.240]   Your natural response should be, which I believe it probably is, "That doesn't sound fair.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:33.880]   Why would that be added on top of the hardship that they were born with?"
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.580]   Why did these things disqualify someone?
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:41.160]   So you have to understand, again, the larger picture, he is not saying that these people
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:45.220]   sinned and because of their sins, they're being punished.
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.660]   That's not what the scripture is saying.
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:49.440]   He's talking about ritual cleansing.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:57.560]   I mean, what is wrong with the high priest visiting his mom at her funeral?
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.160]   But he said you couldn't do that.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:05.280]   I mean, priest trying to comfort those who are mourning at the funeral, who's not their
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.280]   family.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.760]   What is morally wrong with that?
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.760]   Obviously not.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.080]   All of it had to do with ritual cleansing.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.160]   So if you remember, in the other parts of it, even the sacrifices, remember?
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:19.400]   You could not give any sacrifice to God with any kind of defect.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.520]   It had to be a male goat, had to be a male bull.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.000]   And God gives very specific rules.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.360]   Now why does he give these specific rules?
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.440]   Are they in and of itself?
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:34.800]   Do they have specific powers that if you come in and you had some eczema, that somehow that
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:41.920]   disqualifies and it somehow morally taints that animal because the priest has one limb
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.360]   shorter than the other or he has a crushed face or broken arm?
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:50.000]   How does that affect the quality of the sacrifice?
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.440]   So we know that none of these things morally corrupts it.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:03.600]   Everything that God is doing in the book of Leviticus is what, according to the New Testament?
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.600]   Shadow.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:08.440]   There are shadows to point to something else.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:13.720]   So when God tells Israel that your sacrifice need to be perfect, what is that a shadow
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.920]   of?
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.640]   The perfect sacrifice of Christ, right?
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.520]   You can't bring anything defective.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.160]   You can't come to God on your own terms.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:28.360]   All of that is to point to and to reveal what the reality is in heaven.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.280]   So why these things?
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.520]   There were shadows that pointed to the reality.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:39.000]   The tabernacle and the things of God were to teach us about the perfection that is found
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.560]   in Christ and the perfection he will bring when he comes in his full glory.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.040]   All of this points to something.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.320]   It is not to punish the priest.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.720]   It is not to say that one animal has more power over the other.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:03.600]   All of this points to the necessity of a perfect savior or perfect salvation to be reconciled
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:09.560]   to a perfect God.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:14.040]   First Corinthians 13, 8-10, it says, "Love never fails, but if there is gift of profit,
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.760]   they will be done away with.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.040]   If they are a tongue, they will cease.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.000]   If there is knowledge, it will be done away with.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.800]   For we know in part, and we prophesy in part, but when the perfect comes, the partial will
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.440]   be done away with."
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.240]   I think in the NIV, in the other translation, it says "imperfect."
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.200]   When the perfect comes, the imperfect shall pass away.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:39.720]   This is actually a more accurate translation because perfect and imperfect are not Greek
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.840]   words with a different beginning.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:49.960]   The meaning is that when the perfect comes, now there is a debate as to what the perfect
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.960]   is.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.640]   Some people, like a few, very few people will say that is the Bible, which I don't think
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.640]   that is the case.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:03.360]   I don't think you can make a grammatical contextual argument for that being the Bible.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:10.680]   The word perfect means that whatever God intended for our salvation, when God brings it to perfection,
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.960]   he who began a good work will carry it on to perfection until the day of Christ, meaning
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:20.240]   what he has intended in our salvation, you and I have not fully experienced that yet.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.480]   We're only seeing it in part.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.160]   We've only experienced it in part.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.880]   We are worshipping God much closer than we were able to.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:28.960]   We were outside the gate.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:35.360]   We came into the court and we were worshipping God, but yet we are still distant until we
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.320]   are glorified and he comes to bring us.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:41.880]   Until we are glorified with him, we're only experiencing part.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.920]   So that's why the Bible describes our salvation as being saved.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.920]   We are saved.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.920]   We are being saved.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.920]   We will be saved.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.460]   Justification, sanctification, glorification.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:59.640]   So when the perfect comes, when God's intended goal of salvation comes, all that is imperfect
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.200]   shall pass away.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:08.300]   All that is imperfect in an animal, all that is imperfect in a human being was not intended
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.820]   by God.
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:16.320]   Even if it was not a direct result of the sin of that man.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:26.320]   God made Adam and Eve perfect and every imperfection of the man or of the woman was a reflection
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:31.960]   of the imperfection of mankind at the fall.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:39.380]   So when he disqualifies a priest, again symbolically, as a shadow, it is the point to a perfect
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:48.380]   God, to a perfect sacrifice, to make us perfect in him.
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:54.500]   Now this does not mean, just because they kept these laws doesn't mean that they were
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.440]   really pure.
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:01.580]   Just because a man was born perfect and everything was right and ritually he was clean, he married
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:07.260]   the right woman, his children were not in rebellion, doesn't mean that he was righteous
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:08.260]   before God.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:13.420]   All of these things pointed because they were a shadow of the reality that was to come.
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:19.000]   It was only to teach Israel and ultimately the world to reflect God's perfection and
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.900]   ultimately need for man to be made whole in Christ.
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:25.700]   So when we're reading chapter 21, to not to be caught up in thinking, "Well, that's
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:28.140]   not fair," or "This is right," or "This is wrong."
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.020]   What does this teach about God?
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:33.600]   What does this teach about our sin?
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.580]   What does this teach about our salvation?
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:41.620]   What does this teach about God's intended purpose of salvation?
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:49.540]   I want to wrap up all of this to show you that God is a merciful God.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.620]   God is not picking on these people who have these defections and say, "You know what?
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.340]   I don't want anything to do with that."
[00:32:54.340 --> 00:33:00.560]   If you look at Isaiah 56, 3-5, he describes salvation and at some point when he brings
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:05.060]   perfection, it's described this way, "Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:11.140]   the Lord say, 'The Lord will surely separate me from his people,' nor let the eunuch,"
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.140]   right?
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:17.100]   And this eunuch is a man who is described here as a man who is defected.
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:23.660]   "Let the eunuch say, 'Behold, I am a dry tree.'
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:27.380]   For thus says the Lord to the eunuchs who keep my Sabbath and choose what pleases me
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.820]   and hold fast my commandment.
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:35.140]   To them I will give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.740]   that of sons of the daughters, and I will give them an everlasting name which will not
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.300]   be cut off."
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.280]   Remember the Ethiopian eunuch?
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:47.140]   When Philip is caught up in the Holy Spirit and he runs into him and Eunuch says, "What
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.620]   prevents me from being baptized?"
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:51.620]   And he gets baptized and then he disappears?
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.100]   There's a point to that story.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:34:02.060]   The door was being opened to the eunuchs because of what Christ has done, right?
[00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.620]   The defected people, the sins, right?
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:08.660]   The misfits, the broken.
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:15.980]   So the gospel and the perfect sacrifice, the perfect Lamb of God made us perfect in Christ.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:20.620]   So even the eunuch became perfect because of Christ's sacrifice.
[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:26.100]   All of this points to the reality we find in Christ, right?
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.660]   So it has significance, right?
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:32.100]   So sometimes we read the book of Leviticus and we get caught up in these details and
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.540]   we see the bigger picture of what Christ is doing.
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:40.820]   So when you really see God's heart and what God is doing in the big picture, Leviticus
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:49.700]   chapter 21 is really beautiful because he's going to make all of this right.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.940]   All of these defects, right?
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:58.540]   All that went wrong because of the fall, he's going to make it right in Christ.
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.620]   All right.
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.740]   So we have the four questions.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:08.500]   Okay, again, because we're talking about leadership, why is leadership so important in the health
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.780]   of the church?
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.980]   And then there's three passages that you can take a look at for references.
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:17.700]   What is the difference between calling out sins of an elder versus regular member of
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:18.700]   the congregation?
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.180]   In the New Testament, you see the distinction.
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:25.500]   Matthew 18, 15 to 20 talks about dealing with sin in the congregation.
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:29.220]   And then first Timothy 5, 19, calling out an elder.
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:33.600]   So take a look at those passages and see what's different.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.740]   What will the leaders be accountable for according to Hebrews 13, 17?
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:43.140]   And why this is such a high calling that you shouldn't just kind of like drift into.
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.620]   And so as a result of that, it says to submit to your elders because they watch over your
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:47.620]   souls, right?
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:53.700]   So take a look at that passage and say, what higher accountability is there for leadership?
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:58.020]   And then four, should a leader who has fallen be given an opportunity to be stored back
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.020]   into a leadership?
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:02.620]   Again, you may not have time to get to that, but I just threw that in there just in case
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:06.540]   you run out of time and you want something controversial to talk about.
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:07.540]   All right.
[00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:13.620]   So let me pray for us and then I'll let you guys get into your small groups.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:25.820]   Heavenly Father, we just want to thank you so much for seeing our defects, but loving
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.140]   us.
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:34.400]   That Christ's perfection covers our imperfections.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.580]   We thank you.
[00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:42.260]   I pray, Father God, that our worship may be a reasonable response to the glory of the
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:47.460]   gospel of Jesus Christ. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
