[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   If you're burdened down tonight trying to fulfill the law, I've got good news for you.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.480]   Christianity is not a new law.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.920]   It's not replacing the old law with a new law.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.360]   It's replacing law with person.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.440]   And the first thing you encounter, and you're encountering Him right now if you have ears
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.840]   to hear, the first thing you encounter is you meet Jesus as one who says, Matthew 3:15,
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.600]   "It is fitting that we should fulfill all righteousness."
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.600]   And He does.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.680]   He comes right into the human role and He's baptized.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.220]   And at every point, He does what we could not do perfectly, perfectly.
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.640]   Every place the first Adam fell, He did not fall.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.120]   Every failure to trust, He trusted.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.120]   Every disobedience, He obeyed.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.000]   And as the second Adam, I now, by faithâ€¦
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.140]   faith alone, am united to him, and all of his righteousness is mine."
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.200]   And that's not all that he did.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:08.540]   But when he died, Galatians 3.13, he became a curse for us as it is written, "Cursed is
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.180]   everyone who hangs on the tree."
[00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.860]   So now he's done two massive things for me, this Christ that I meet first on my way to
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.220]   some do's and don'ts in the Bible.
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.300]   The first thing he has done is fulfill all the demands of the law that I cannot fulfill.
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.700]   And the second thing he's done is bear the curse for all my failures so that a righteousness
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.560]   is provided and a substitute curse is endured.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.540]   And I am the freest of all people in the Holy Spirit now.
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.040]   Amen.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.040]   Amen.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.540]   Amen.
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:51.540]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
