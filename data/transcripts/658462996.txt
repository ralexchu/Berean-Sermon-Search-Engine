[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.240]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Matthew Chapter 1, we'll be reading from verse 21-25.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.680]   Matthew Chapter 1, verse 21-25.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.020]   "So she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.140]   from their sins."
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.100]   Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, "Behold,
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.900]   the virgin shall be with child, and shall bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel,"
[00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.800]   which translated means "God with us."
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.840]   And Joseph spoke from his sleep, Joseph woke from his sleep, and did as the angel of the
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.400]   Lord commanded him, and took Mary as his wife, but kept her a virgin until she gave birth
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.280]   to a son, and he called his name Jesus.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.280]   Let's pray.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:09.640]   Heavenly Father, we pray for continued grace as we celebrate the birth of Christ, Immanuel.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.920]   Help us to understand the impact of what it is that we celebrate this holiday season.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.740]   Help us to know the meaning of Christmas, that not only for ourselves, but for all those
[00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.440]   around us, that we may be a good witness, the Oral Home of Christ.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.680]   May your blessing be upon this time, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.240]   Now that I have children who are a bit older, I am able to get legitimate gifts, where prior
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.740]   to every Christmas, it was just one-way street.
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.880]   So now they have their own jobs, and they have money in their pocket, so each time they
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.400]   come around, they're asking, "What do you want?
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.400]   You want shoes?
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.400]   You want this?
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.400]   You want that?"
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.520]   I'm actually benefiting from Christmas now.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.620]   I remember years ago, I forgot how many years, maybe about three years ago, you know, they
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.560]   asked, three or four years, they asked me what I wanted for Christmas, and I think I
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.800]   told them I wanted shoes, and they mustered up whatever money that they had, and they
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.800]   bought me a used pair of booster shoes.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.800]   You know the Adidas?
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.800]   Ultra Boost.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   Ultra Boost.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.200]   Booster, ultra, whatever, right.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.480]   It's probably one of the most comfortable shoes I had, but I would never wear used shoes,
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.840]   but I wore it for a period because my children got it for me.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.760]   It's the first time they were able to muster up money and get me something, and so I did
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.040]   my best to wear it as long as possible.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.360]   But you know, when our children were younger, they would ask, "What do you want for Christmas?"
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.920]   And I'm sure some of you parents can relate, because we know they don't have resources,
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.000]   they don't have money, and so typically what I would say is I want peace and quiet, right.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.720]   And so they know that, "What do you want for Christmas?"
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.520]   It's like, "Well, the only thing that you can afford to give me that I'd want is peace
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.520]   and quiet."
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.440]   Well, how do you get peace and quiet?
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.560]   Just be good to your brothers, good to your sisters, right.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.480]   Because when the children are young, so much of your energy is given to take care of your
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.240]   kids that any little help is going to be beneficial.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.340]   So we would say, okay, you know, it's half joking, but seriously, we say we want some
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.400]   peace and quiet, right, to be good to your brother, to be good to your sister.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.800]   Christmas is the only holiday where we celebrate someone else's birthday by giving presents
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.880]   to other people other than the person that we celebrate, right.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.580]   Christmas is a day we celebrate the birth of Christ, but all of our attention is given
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.380]   to our brothers and sisters and friends and family and to make sure that they're well
[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.840]   taken care of.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.480]   And I think it's appropriate, right.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.360]   It's appropriate because God spends so much time and energy taking care of us.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.360]   What is it that you and I could possibly give to God that He doesn't already have?
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.760]   He doesn't need finances, right.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.520]   There's nothing that we have that He doesn't already have in abundance, but for us to join
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.140]   Him in taking care of His children that He cares for and loves.
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.040]   And so this is a special day as we come together and celebrate Jesus's birthday, but I want
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.960]   to make sure that we understand what it is that we are really celebrating.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.280]   And none of the things that you'll hear today is going to be anything particularly new,
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.560]   how many Christmases that you've gone through.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.840]   But I think the depth and the impact of what it is that we talk about this morning is important
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.080]   for us to visit.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.640]   As Jesus was being prophesied that He was going to come, obviously He was named Jesus,
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.540]   Savior, but He said the title that was given Him was a title that was prophesied in the
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.400]   book of Isaiah, that His name would be Emmanuel.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:55.600]   And Emmanuel basically means that He is God with us, God with us.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.000]   And it's important for us to understand what that means because as simple as that is, and
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.360]   you've probably heard that word many, many times, sing it every Christmas, but what is
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.280]   the real impact of this?
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.820]   So this morning I want to try to unpack this word Emmanuel and what does that have to do
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.200]   with Christmas.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.320]   First meaning behind the title Emmanuel is pretty obvious.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.080]   It means that Jesus is God.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.560]   No surprise to any of you, right?
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.600]   You wouldn't be here if you didn't believe that.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.880]   But the impact of that meaning, again, we live in a culture where that's being challenged
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.960]   and sometimes even inside the church.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.520]   Years ago I was out on campus at UCI trying to share the gospel and I met a UCI professor
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.600]   who was challenging us and saying that Jesus never claimed to be God.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.380]   He claimed to be the Son of God.
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.680]   He claimed to be a God, but not God Himself.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.580]   At that time I wasn't versed well enough in scripture to be able to open the Bible and
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:02.800]   argue with him, and I remember going back to my professors at Biola asking, "Can you
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   help me to understand it?"
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.520]   And he opened up a few scriptures and it was crystal clear, but at that time I couldn't.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.440]   And I was looking, every time I go on campus I look for him.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.840]   Now I'm better equipped.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.640]   But of all the things that I can point out, to me the greatest and the most clearest place
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.880]   where Jesus declares to be God Himself is Matthew chapter, sorry, in John chapter 5,
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.280]   21 to 23.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.880]   This is what he says about Himself.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.920]   "For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.120]   life to whom He wishes."
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:45.280]   That statement alone, where Jesus says, "God has the power to give life and so do I."
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:51.560]   That statement alone would have gotten stoned because only God is the author of life.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.880]   And He says, "God has the authority and so do I," in verse 22, "for not even the Father
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.040]   judges anyone, but He has given all judgment to the Son."
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.000]   Now if the first statement wasn't blasphemous enough, the second statement He says, "I do
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.680]   even what the Father doesn't do.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.280]   I have the authority to judge."
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:15.400]   And then third, in verse 23, "So that all will honor the Son, even as they honor the
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.400]   Father.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.440]   He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him."
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.920]   Do you remember how many times in the scripture where a prophet would declare God's Word or
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:30.620]   they would perform miracles and they would bow down in honor of the prophet and the prophet
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.760]   or the angel in fear would beg them, "Get back up.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.760]   I'm a man.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.440]   I'm a servant just like you.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.060]   If you worship me, you will be judged and I will be judged."
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.840]   But Jesus here says, "If you do not honor me, you do not honor the Father."
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.600]   And so He places Himself to be equal with God.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.960]   So any one of these statements would have been blasphemous enough because it was crystal
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.840]   clear and that's exactly how the Jews understood it.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.280]   Because they said, "We want to stone you, not because of the many miracles, but because
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.480]   you being a mere man claim to be God."
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.360]   So Jesus made it crystal clear who He is.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:14.080]   In John chapter 1 verse 1, it says, "In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.920]   God and the Word was God."
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:23.640]   You notice here He says the Word in reference to Jesus was with God and yet He was also
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.080]   God Himself.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:31.960]   So we see in the very beginning of the gospel there is a statement of His Trinitarian relationship
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:37.960]   with God the Father, the second person, because He was with God and yet He says He also is
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.600]   God.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.800]   The Bible is not ambiguous about this.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:51.040]   When we say that Jesus is Emmanuel, it's declaring who He is.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:58.480]   Even in our wildest imagination, we can't create something bigger than God.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.360]   You know, like recently we had all these Avengers movies coming out.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.840]   I know Spider-Man is very popular right now, but among the Avenger movies about these superheroes,
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.840]   right?
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.120]   We would ask our questions just as a fun question, you know, what superhero would you want to
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.120]   be?
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.120]   What powers do you want, right?
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.600]   So if you're going to pick one, you're going to pick one with the most power.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:23.520]   Superman, maybe Captain Marvel, right?
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.940]   Not Captain America, Captain Marvel, right?
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.120]   So who are the most powerful?
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:33.280]   Well in recent history, they came up with another character, not necessarily a superhero,
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.560]   but a character that can demolish all other superheroes.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:43.480]   Thanos, which happens to mean in Greek, death.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.720]   So they created this figure, if you have the five stones, that basically by clicking the
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:53.600]   finger you can destroy half the world and all the powers of the other superheroes, imaginations
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:00.080]   of all the other superheroes could not overcome this power of Thanos.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:05.680]   Even in our wildest imagination, even with all the power that Thanos has with all the
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:12.840]   stones, it still functions within God's creation.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:19.600]   So even in our wildest imagination, the most powerful being that was created by some of
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:26.440]   the most creative people in the world created a being that is a tiny little figure in God's
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.720]   creation.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:35.440]   To say that Jesus is God, we need to understand the gravity of what that means.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:40.960]   In Colossians 1.16 it says, "For by him all things were created, both in heavens and on
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.740]   earth, visible and invisible."
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:49.940]   Anything that you and I know of, plus the invisible world, whether thrones or dominions
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.500]   or rulers or authority, all things have been created through him and for him.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:11:00.140]   So I want to show you a video to kind of illustrate, because sometimes it's easier to visualize.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:08.060]   So if you can play the video.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:15.060]   So I want you to see the gravity of what I'm talking about.
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.060]   Okay.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.060]   [Video plays]
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.060]   [Music]

[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:18.060]   [Music]
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:22.060]   Okay, if you turn the lights back on.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:30.060]   I wanted to visually show you just the magnitude of even just the galaxy that we live in.
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:38.060]   The largest planet star that's in our galaxy. It requires over a thousand years for it to travel around it.
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:42.060]   That's in, that's just one star of billions of stars in our galaxy.
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:48.060]   And our galaxy is one of billions of galaxies that they know of.
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:52.060]   So think how tiny we are on Earth.
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:57.060]   And think how tiny our Earth is in light of one planet.
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:02.060]   And think how tiny that planet is in comparison to all the other planets in the galaxy.
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:07.060]   And think about that galaxy in the context of all the other galaxies.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.060]   That's how tiny we are.
[00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:15.060]   And so the scripture says Jesus is the creator of all that.
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.060]   And they're constantly finding more galaxies.
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:23.060]   So we can't even, we can't even comprehend how big God is.
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:29.060]   And so when he says God with us, he's referring to that God.
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:34.060]   And that's just what we see. The Bible says he's a creator of the visible and the invisible.
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:39.060]   So I think it's important for us to understand the gravity of when we see,
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:43.060]   when we say that we have this relationship with this God.
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.060]   That we worship this God.
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.060]   That we understand what it is that we are worshiping.
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.060]   What it is that we are praying to. Who it is that we are praying to.
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:59.060]   And secondly, God with us, the word Emmanuel means that God took on human flesh.
[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.060]   Consider who we are, the frailty of man.
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.060]   You know, whenever we celebrate Christmas, we say he humbled himself,
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:12.060]   became an infant to a teenage mom who wasn't wealthy, was born in a manger,
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.060]   and he was humble, and we talk about all of that.
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:19.060]   But think about what's happening right now.
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:24.060]   We have a tiny little virus that you and I have never seen.
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:28.060]   That the world doesn't have an answer for yet.
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:35.060]   And as a result of that, all of the earth has shut down to a certain degree.
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.060]   That's how frail we are.
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:42.060]   Something that tiny has caused this kind of disturbance to us.
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.060]   That's how frail we are.
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.060]   So to understand that God came and took on human flesh,
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:53.060]   is that God came into this frail humanity.
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.060]   Think about the magnitude of that.
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.060]   Think about all the different mysteries that we wonder about.
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:04.060]   And we think, you know, like, oh, you know, can a man really come back from the dead?
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:08.060]   And there's all so much debate about the resurrection of Christ.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.060]   Can a man actually walk on water?
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:13.060]   Did Lazarus actually was raised?
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:17.060]   If you believe that that God of the universe became a man,
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:22.060]   resurrection should not be a problem.
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:26.060]   Raising Lazarus from the dead should not be a problem.
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:29.060]   You can snap his finger and the whole earth could come back to life if he wanted to.
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.060]   That's the God of the universe.
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:35.060]   But that God took on human form.
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.060]   You know, there's a--in the scientific world,
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.060]   they have this principle called the anthropic principle.
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:46.060]   And basically is what is necessary for human life to happen.
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:51.060]   And so years ago, they thought that maybe there were thousands of stars
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:57.060]   and thousands of planets out there that could possibly harbor life,
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.060]   has all the things that is necessary to have life.
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:04.060]   But more and more they studied, they realized that number is dwindling down more and more.
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:08.060]   The more knowledge that they have of what is necessary to have life,
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:13.060]   now they have dwindled all of that down to possibly 60.
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:18.060]   And they said from 60 is actually shrinking every time they find something new.
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:23.060]   That all of these things need to happen in order for life to actually even happen.
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:28.060]   Albert Einstein, in the process of studying the universe, says this,
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.060]   "The temptation to believe that the universe is a product of some sort of design,
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:37.060]   a manifestation of subtle aesthetic and mathematical judgment, is overwhelming.
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:44.060]   The belief that there is something behind it all is one that I personally share with the majority of scientists."
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:49.060]   Even though Albert Einstein never came to faith as a Christian,
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:54.060]   he says that not only him, but majority of scientists who look into this,
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:58.060]   said because there's so many things that need to happen,
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:05.060]   so many things that the flesh needs in order for us to be able to breathe and wake up and continue,
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:10.060]   that he believes that it is impossible to think that there wasn't some intelligent design.
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:13.060]   There is not a God behind all of this.
[00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.060]   Philippians chapter 2, 5-7, it says,
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.060]   "Have this attitude in yourself, which was also in Christ Jesus,
[00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:25.060]   who although he existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:30.060]   but emptied himself, taking the form of a bond-servant and being made in likeness of men."
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:37.060]   He said God, in every way God, decided to veil his glory and he put on humanity.
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:39.060]   And some people had looked at that and said,
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:46.060]   "Well, you know what happened was God kind of abandoned some of his deity in order to take on humanity."
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:55.060]   The theologians, to better explain this, describe this union of God in humanity and God himself,
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.060]   they call this a hypostatic union.
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:01.060]   The word hypostatic union basically means to stand under.
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.060]   That's what that word means.
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:08.060]   Hypo, where we get the word to be under, stastis means to stand.
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:12.060]   So basically the description is that God is 100% man and 100% God.
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.060]   You probably heard that term before.
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:19.060]   But let me better illustrate this with an illustration.
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:25.060]   If you see this, on the bottom you have water and on the top you have oil.
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:29.060]   So when you describe this, the oil on the top is 100% oil,
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.060]   the water on the bottom is 100% water because it does not mix.
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:39.060]   And yet when we talk about this cup, we talk about water and the oil in the same cup.
[00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.060]   And so that's what hypostatic union is a description of.
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:52.060]   Of God, in every way, still retaining his deity, yet veiled his glory in order to take on human flesh.
[00:20:52.060 --> 00:21:03.060]   And so he took on all of the frailty of mankind while retaining the fullness of his deity.
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.060]   Why is this important?
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:10.060]   Because the gravity of what that means,
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:16.060]   that this Christmas we celebrate the God of the galaxies,
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:22.060]   took on what you and I could possibly imagine, took on human form.
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.060]   I mean, of course, that's what Christmas is, right?
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:28.060]   You've heard this, we sing about this every single year.
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:32.060]   So after a while, we say, yeah, this is the day we celebrate Jesus' birthday.
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.060]   But think about what that means.
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:39.060]   Think about all the things that we contemplate, we ask questions and we wonder about.
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:44.060]   But the greatest mystery of human history is this.
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:50.060]   That that God walked on this earth as a human being.
[00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:56.060]   And so the natural question that you and I would ask is, why? Why did he do that?
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:22:06.060]   So either, if you do not believe this, this is harder to believe than anything else.
[00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:13.060]   Like Jesus' resurrection, feeding of the 5,000, that's easy.
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:17.060]   Either you say, that's ridiculous, that God became man?
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:22.060]   And you would either reject Christmas and reject everything else that comes with that.
[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:29.060]   Or, if you understand and believe Christmas, then everything else,
[00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:34.060]   everything else that comes along with that makes perfect sense.
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:39.060]   The natural question that you and I need to ask about this is, if God truly became man,
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.060]   why did he do this?
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:46.060]   I remember years ago, when we were going out to China, we would go to the remotest part of China.
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:55.060]   And it wasn't that difficult, but obviously, we're pretty wealthy compared to the rest of the world.
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:59.060]   Everywhere we travel, we want to make sure that we have proper lodging, there's food there,
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.060]   especially if you have young children.
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:06.060]   But we were going to an area where the hotel wasn't exactly comfortable for us,
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:10.060]   no air conditioning, and the food wasn't to our liking.
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:16.060]   But we would go there because we wanted to share the gospel, spend two weeks waking up early in the morning,
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:20.060]   preparing, and then we would literally go to sleep at 11, something like 12 o'clock at night.
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.060]   And we did this for two weeks straight.
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:27.060]   After a couple years of this, one of the leaders of the school, we got comfortable enough,
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:33.060]   we were having dinner, and he leaned over to me and asked me, "Peter, why do you guys come?"
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:37.060]   Because he was curious.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:42.060]   "You guys are wealthy. Why do you spend your own money to come here, stay at a hotel?"
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.060]   Because this guy traveled to Europe, and so he knows what it's like in the United States.
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:50.060]   And he said, "Why do you spend your own money to come here, teach a bunch of students that you don't know,
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:56.060]   spend all these hours with them, and what benefit do you get from this?"
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:24:01.060]   So obviously, we're trying to keep our gospel message down low because he's one of the leaders there.
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:04.060]   But he's not dumb.
[00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:09.060]   If I give him a wrong answer, he's going to know, it's like, "Oh, he's fooling me."
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:13.060]   So I said to him, "It's because we're Christians."
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:16.060]   And he already knew this.
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:22.060]   So we're Christians, and so as Christians, we are told to help other people.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.060]   And so we're here, and that's part of what it means to be a Christian.
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.060]   So obviously, we would not be here.
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:32.060]   If we wanted to make money, we could go to Japan and Korea and do the same thing and actually make money doing this.
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.060]   But we're doing this because part of what it means to be a Christian is to do this,
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.060]   and we want to share what God has given to us.
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:40.060]   And then he said, "Oh, okay."
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:45.060]   And he said, "Is it wrong if the students ask us about what we believe and we tell them we're Christians?
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.060]   Is that illegal?"
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.060]   And he said, "Oh, no, no, that's not illegal.
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:52.060]   It's just don't do it in the classroom."
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:59.060]   And he said, "Is it illegal for us to talk about Thanksgiving, for Easter, Christmas?"
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.060]   As long as it's in the context of the school.
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.060]   But I share all of this because it was perplexing to him.
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:13.060]   Why would you guys who have the money to go somewhere nice, comfortable, and vacation, you know, to check off a bucket list,
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.060]   why would you come here?
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:21.060]   And all we are is just a little bit more wealthy than they are, but they're all other human beings just like us.
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.060]   And it wasn't like we couldn't have food.
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:30.060]   And yet, when we talk about the God of the universe who came and walked on earth,
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.060]   that should be the greatest mystery.
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.060]   Why did he come?
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:37.060]   Why was he here?
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:41.060]   If that God came here, why did he come?
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.060]   What was his purpose?
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.060]   Well, there's three things that I want to highlight here.
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:53.060]   First, the Bible makes it clear, Jesus came to us because we could not go to God.
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:58.060]   The Bible says that because of our sin and rebellion, that we were separated from God.
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:04.060]   We were in rebellion. Mankind is in rebellion against God, refusing to acknowledge him as the creator.
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:09.060]   And because of that, we have been separated from the author of life.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:15.060]   So this separation isn't simply that we're not able to have a relationship with him, because he's the author of life.
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:21.060]   To be separated from this God means that we have been separated from life itself.
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:25.060]   And so, sinners cannot be in the presence of this holy God,
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:29.060]   just like we cannot be in the presence of a nuclear reactor when it leaks,
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:33.060]   because what comes out of that is going to kill us.
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:39.060]   So the scripture says, a sinful man in the presence of a holy God, we would be destroyed.
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:43.060]   And the Bible says, no man can see God and live.
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.060]   So we could not go to him.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:51.060]   So the Bible says that Jesus veiled his glory and came to us.
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:59.060]   It says in Colossians 115, he is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:03.060]   He is the exact representation of his glory, yet veiled.
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:10.060]   And so, in order for us to be able to see God, he came to us.
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:20.060]   Secondly, it says God, in Jesus Christ, Emmanuel, God-man, became the perfect mediator.
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:25.060]   If you want somebody to mediate, you want somebody who understands both sides well.
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:31.060]   You don't want somebody just to, if you want somebody to represent just your side, you call an ambassador.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:36.060]   He said, no, but Jesus Christ came to be the mediator in 1 Timothy 2.5,
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:43.060]   where there is one God and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:47.060]   As you guys already know, I'm a Korean-American.
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:52.060]   I was born in Korea, raised most of my life in the United States, so I'm more Americanized than Koreanized.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:57.060]   But I understand the Korean culture enough where when I used to serve in the Korean church,
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:06.060]   I realized there's some huge differences that the younger Korean generation that was born and raised here
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.060]   that did not understand that I had to kind of mediate.
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:14.060]   And one of the key things that I learned, and I learned that this is not only true of the Korean culture,
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.060]   but most Asian culture functions in a similar way.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.060]   Maybe not Japan, but most Asian cultures.
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:23.060]   Chinese culture, they use the word "guanxi."
[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:28.060]   So I'm teaching Chinese to a room filled with Chinese people.
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:31.060]   I have that kind of boldness.
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:34.060]   So it means relationship.
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:38.060]   So in the Western culture, everything is done by contract.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:42.060]   So even in the church, if you come in, they tell you, well, what's my job, what's my pay,
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.060]   what am I supposed to do, what am I not supposed to do?
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:49.060]   And then so you agree on that, and then based on that, you do what you agree on.
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.060]   Well, the Korean culture doesn't function that way.
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:56.060]   You can have a contract, but if you have a bad relationship with your elders or leaders,
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.060]   it doesn't matter what the contract says.
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:02.060]   But if you have a good relationship with them, if you have guanxi,
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:06.060]   then even if things don't go exactly right, they'll cover you.
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:10.060]   They'll forgive you and they'll support you, and you'll have a good experience.
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:14.060]   But the thing is, people who grew up in the Western culture have a hard time understanding that.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:17.060]   But we said this, we agreed with this.
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:21.060]   And that's why a lot of the Western missionaries have a hard time when they get into China
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.060]   because they have these rules like, oh, we can't do this, we can't do that.
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:30.060]   And the other Asians, you know, especially Koreans, when they come into China, you know, it's like water.
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.060]   Kind of like Bruce Lee, right?
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.060]   Be water, my friend, right?
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.060]   Be whatever, whatever you need to be.
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:41.060]   And that's kind of how the Asian culture, especially the Korean culture and Chinese culture function.
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:45.060]   And so as somebody in the middle, I have to constantly relate that, right?
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:51.060]   I have to tell the Korean side, this is how the Koreans raised here.
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.060]   That's how they think.
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:55.060]   If you agreed on that, you have to function that way and understand that to them,
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:58.060]   you have to follow that to be righteous.
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:03.060]   In the Korean culture, if you don't respect your elders, it doesn't matter what you agreed on, right?
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:07.060]   Because to them, that's more righteous.
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:15.060]   Well, Christ came to be the perfect mediator between God and man because he is 100% God and 100% man.
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:19.060]   He is the perfect mediator between a sinful man and a holy God.
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:22.060]   In Hebrews 4.15-16, it says,
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:27.060]   "For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses,
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:32.060]   but one who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:37.060]   Therefore, let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace so that we may receive mercy
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:41.060]   and find grace to help in time of need."
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:45.060]   The Bible says that Christ intercedes on our behalf
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:55.060]   because the only way that we can reconcile with this holy God is that this perfect mediator stands before us.
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:59.060]   You know, I shared with the first service, I'm going to share this with the second service.
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:05.060]   Recently, I became an owner of two cats.
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:11.060]   Those of you who know me know that I was determined to never own a pet.
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:17.060]   And part of the reason why is because we actually had pets when we were younger and didn't have good experience.
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:21.060]   We tortured every pet that we had.
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:26.060]   And the other real reason is I don't want to get attached to a pet.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:30.060]   I don't want to get attached to a pet and then go through the sadness of losing the pet.
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:33.060]   I'm going to reserve that for people.
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.060]   That's my rationale.
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:41.060]   But my family has been begging me for a pet for years, and I was the only person that's like, "No.
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:45.060]   I don't want that smell here, and there's people who are allergic to cats and dogs,
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.060]   and I don't want to have to shun people away because we're going to own a cat."
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.060]   So I had all these reasoning behind it.
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:32:01.060]   And then my daughter, I think she devised this plan, right, that she asked us, like, "Can I foster a cat?"
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:04.060]   Foster. Not own, foster.
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:07.060]   And for how long? Two weeks.
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:11.060]   We're going to take care of her two weeks, you know, we're going to play with the cat, and then return it after two weeks.
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:15.060]   So I said, "Okay. Just foster."
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.060]   How much does it cost? It costs nothing.
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.060]   They provide the feed. They provide everything.
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.060]   Right? And I said, "Okay, for two weeks."
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:27.060]   So they bring this cat home, and the first two, three days, the cat is meowing all night.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.060]   You know? And Faith is sleeping out in the living room.
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.060]   And so I said, "Okay, this is not going to last long. How long?"
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:35.060]   At some point, she's going to realize how hard it is to own a cat.
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:39.060]   But each day, she would grow more fond of this cat, and then one day, they said,
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.060]   "Hey, this meowing, this is not normal."
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:46.060]   They took them back to the foster place, and then they came back with two cats.
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:50.060]   [Laughter]
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:52.060]   "What's going on here?"
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:56.060]   And they said, they took the cat back, and then they said, "The cat is lonely."
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:59.060]   [Laughter]
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.060]   They know what they're doing. Right?
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:08.060]   And they said, "Either you drop the cat off now, or you take another cat so that the cat won't be lonely."
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.060]   Right?
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.060]   When they came home, they were so sheepish.
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:16.060]   Even before they showed me the cat, you could tell they were kind of looking at each other
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:20.060]   to see how I was going to react, and they opened up the box, and two cats jumped out.
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.060]   I go, "What?"
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:28.060]   We went from fostering one cat to now two cats, and it was supposed to be two weeks.
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:32.060]   Now we're into what? Our fifth? Going to six weeks?
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:37.060]   And I said, "When is this going to end?" Right?
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:41.060]   And so, I'm kind of thinking, at some point, they're going to give up.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:46.060]   And it wasn't just Faith. Faith recruited her mom, her younger brother Isaiah.
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:53.060]   And so now, every day, when they're bored, they're in the room playing with the cat.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:57.060]   And so I get sucked up into that, and now I'm sitting there watching these two cats play.
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:01.060]   And they are cute, but in the back of my mind, it's like, "Man, I got suckered."
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:04.060]   [Laughter]
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:07.060]   And so I'm saying, "How long is this going to last?"
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:12.060]   And Faith has gotten fond of this cat, and so did my wife and my son.
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:18.060]   And Faith said, "You know, we're supposed to go to Korea next year, if it opens up, to visit.
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.060]   How are you going to do that with these two cats?"
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:27.060]   And she said, "I'd rather give up my trip so that I can have this cat."
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:30.060]   I said, "Oh my gosh, you got suckered into this."
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.060]   [Laughter]
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:38.060]   I can't. And it's not because I love the cats. They're cute.
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.060]   I can get rid of them tomorrow if they weren't home, right?
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:45.060]   [Laughter]
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:52.060]   But they have a sympathetic mediator, these two cats.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:57.060]   And not because I love these two cats, but because I love my daughter.
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:00.060]   Because I love my wife, I love my son.
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:04.060]   And let me say officially here, if you wanted to keep the cats, you can keep the cats.
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.060]   [Laughter]
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.060]   I got suckered.
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:10.060]   [Laughter]
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:14.060]   We'll talk about Korea. We'll see what happens with Korea.
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:19.060]   But they have a sympathetic--these two cats have a sympathetic high priest.
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:21.060]   [Laughter]
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:26.060]   And I cannot take that away from them.
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:31.060]   There's a story about this boy who wanted a dog.
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:36.060]   And the parents decided to get him a dog for Christmas and went to the pet shop.
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:42.060]   And the pet shop owner started bringing all these different animals to the boy.
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.060]   And the boy would just say, "No, no, no, no, no."
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:47.060]   And by the time they got through all the healthy dogs, they said,
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:50.060]   "Well, how come you don't want any of these dogs? I thought you wanted a pet."
[00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:53.060]   And he said, "Yeah, I'm looking for the right one. Do you have any other?"
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:57.060]   So the pet shop owner said, "Well, we do have one, but I don't even want to show him to you
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.060]   because for sure you're not going to want it."
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:01.060]   He said, "Well, let me see."
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.060]   So he goes to the back and brings this puppy out.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:08.060]   And the puppy was clearly--was not whole, was limping in.
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:13.060]   And one of the legs was broken or could not use it, so it was limping in.
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:19.060]   And this boy just ran and hugged it and said, "This is the one."
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:23.060]   And so the pet shop owner was surprised.
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:27.060]   He said, "Every other person that came in here rejected this dog. Why do you want this dog?"
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:34.060]   And so the boy just took his pants and he just started rolling it up to show that he had a wooden leg.
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:39.060]   And so he said, "I want this dog because I can relate to this dog.
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.060]   I need to be this dog's owner."
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:49.060]   The Scripture says Christ came and became a sympathetic high priest
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:54.060]   so that he's not just in the middle of logistically taking care of business.
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:59.060]   He said, "I can relate to you, your suffering, your struggles."
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:08.060]   The Scriptures--in church tradition, it says that Christ is a sympathetic high priest,
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:12.060]   went through suffering, and it said possibly he may have lost his father when he was young.
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:16.060]   That's why Joseph is not mentioned in the Gospel stories other than the beginning.
[00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:20.060]   He knows what it means to be rejected. He knows what it means to be lonely.
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:22.060]   He knows what it means to have hardship.
[00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:26.060]   His closest friends abandoning him at the greatest of need.
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.060]   He knows all our pains.
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:34.060]   And he was tempted in every way, the Scripture says, and yet he was without sin.
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:39.060]   And so as a result, he became the perfect mediator.
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:44.060]   Mediator to do what? The third thing it says, to save us.
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:52.060]   As it said in verse 21, Matthew chapter 1, he said he was going to come to save us from our sins.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:57.060]   Hebrews chapter 2, 14 to 18, "Therefore since the children share in flesh and blood,
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:02.060]   he himself likewise also partook of the same, that through death he might render powerless
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:07.060]   him who had the power of death, that is the devil, and might free those who through fear of death
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:10.060]   were subject to slavery all their lives."
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:14.060]   Second Corinthians 5, 21, "He made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf,
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:19.060]   so that we might become the righteousness of God in him."
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:24.060]   And so he says, "Come, come to me all who are weary and heavy laden,
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:29.060]   that we have a high priest, the God of the universe, who took on human form,
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:35.060]   to invite us, that I know your suffering, I know your hardship,
[00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:43.060]   I know the difficulty of living in this fallen world, of broken relationships, of being rejected.
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:48.060]   He knows this." So he says, "Come, because I know your suffering."
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:51.060]   And he says, "I will give you peace."
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:56.060]   How much of our lives are being jumped around from place to place, relationship to relationship,
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:39:02.060]   from job to job, seeking peace that they cannot give?
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:06.060]   And so that's the reason the Bible says that he came, 1 Peter 2, 14,
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:12.060]   "He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness,
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:18.060]   for by his wounds we are healed."
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:23.060]   Now everything that I told you is what he's done.
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:27.060]   This is what he accomplished by coming.
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:30.060]   He brought God to us, he became the perfect mediator,
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:34.060]   and then he became the propitiation, atonement for our own sins.
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:39.060]   But there's a greater question than that. Not what he's done, but why.
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:45.060]   I can tell you the intricate details of what the Bible says about atonement.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:51.060]   I've been studying the Bible since 1983, and I've been preaching through the scriptures.
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:54.060]   Some of these passages multiple times.
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:58.060]   I read most of the commentaries from Genesis to Revelation.
[00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:04.060]   So I can give you the background information and tell you what the passage means.
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:11.060]   But the greatest mystery has become a greater mystery to me after all these years than ever.
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.060]   And that question is, why?
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:20.060]   I know what he did, but why would the God of the universe do that for me?
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.060]   And do that for you?
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:26.060]   And the answer is simple, and yet so mysterious.
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:34.060]   John 3.16, it says, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:40.060]   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life."
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:44.060]   It says it's because he loved us.
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:49.060]   Now, we may receive that and say, "Yeah, of course he loved us."
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.060]   But imagine the magnitude of that.
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.060]   Why?
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:57.060]   Why would he love us? Look how small we are.
[00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:05.060]   You know, we have a problem. If we were to go hunting, and the larger the animal is, the harder it is for us to kill.
[00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:09.060]   We never think twice about killing a cockroach.
[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:13.060]   Because they're small, they're tiny, they seem insignificant, just by size.
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.060]   Think how tiny we are on this planet.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:21.060]   Think how tiny the planet is in our universe, and in the galaxy.
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:25.060]   And then all of it put together, think how tiny we are.
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:28.060]   And yet, why would God think of us?
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:31.060]   And that's why the psalmist says in Psalm 144, 3-4,
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:35.060]   "Oh Lord, what is man that you take knowledge of him, or son of man, that you think of him?
[00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:40.060]   Man is like a mere breath, his days are like passing shadow."
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:44.060]   Why? Why would you love us?
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:49.060]   That mystery, that I could not comprehend, the day that I became a Christian,
[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:54.060]   is more mysterious to me today than it was 40 years ago.
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:59.060]   I can tell you what he did. I can exposit the text to you, and say, "This is what happened.
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:02.060]   This is what needs to be done. This is what confession looks like.
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:07.060]   This is what predestination looks like."
[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:15.060]   But I am more perplexed today than ever when he says, "He so loved the world."
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:18.060]   Why?
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:23.060]   That should engross all of us this Christmas season.
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.060]   Why would he love us?
[00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:28.060]   And that's what John says in 1 John 3, 1-3,
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:33.060]   "See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us.
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:38.060]   Behold how great the love the Father has bestowed on us, that we would be called children of God.
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:43.060]   And such we are. For this reason the world does not know us, because it did not know him.
[00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:48.060]   Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:53.060]   We know that when he appears, we will be like him, because we will see him just as he is."
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:58.060]   Everyone who has this hope fixed on him purifies himself just as he is pure.
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:00.060]   What hope is he referring to?
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.060]   It's his love.
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:08.060]   This love of God that compels us, renews us, changes us.
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:13.060]   Either we don't believe this and we just walk away,
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:19.060]   or we believe this and it changes everything.
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:24.060]   You know, I grew up with three boys, as you guys know,
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:29.060]   and I'm the middle child, and I'm the prototypical middle child.
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.060]   So whenever they say middle child, it's like, yeah, that's me. I don't deny it.
[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:39.060]   I grew up thinking, like, nobody loves me, nobody cares for me, everything's unfair.
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:46.060]   Why do I get targeted if my parents walk in and somebody's crying, it's my fault.
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:49.060]   Whether that was true or not, that's how I felt growing up all my life.
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:51.060]   I don't belong anywhere.
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:54.060]   I left the country that I was born in, came to the United States.
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:59.060]   I don't fit here. We're in the East Coast, Midwest, the South, going back and forth.
[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:05.060]   And even though my dad was a pastor, I don't remember growing up in the youth group,
[00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:08.060]   because we were changing constantly.
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:14.060]   And so my greatest struggle inwardly is, like, I don't matter.
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:18.060]   And I struggled with that.
[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:23.060]   Everywhere we went, that was my primary struggle, and I was angry inwardly because I don't matter.
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:27.060]   I remember thinking, if I disappear, no one's going to miss me.
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:32.060]   And I remember thinking, if I disappear, I wonder how long it takes before somebody looks for me.
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:41.060]   Now, all of this, looking back at it now as a parent, looking back at it as a child who was hurting.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:45.060]   But that thought was deep in me.
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.060]   And I'm sure some of you guys can relate to that.
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:50.060]   Maybe some of you in this room may be feeling that way.
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:54.060]   But that's how I felt most of the days.
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:56.060]   If I disappeared, who would look for me?
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:59.060]   I wonder how long it would take.
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:02.060]   And so because that was my default setting, I was bitter about everything.
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.060]   Every little thing that happened would set me off.
[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:09.060]   And when people would warn me, say, don't you care if you're going to go to jail or you're going to die?
[00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:13.060]   My answer is, so?
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:16.060]   I wanted to die anyway.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:20.060]   And then I met Christ.
[00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:26.060]   And it wasn't this detailed explanation of the gospel and about exposition.
[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:30.060]   I heard this great sermon.
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:33.060]   All of a sudden, I was like, he's real.
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:35.060]   He's actually real.
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:37.060]   I've been hearing about him.
[00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:39.060]   I've heard sermons about him.
[00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.060]   I've memorized scriptures about him.
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:43.060]   And I didn't really think deeply about it.
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.060]   And then, he's actually real.
[00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:47.060]   So that means he loves me?
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.060]   The gospel is real?
[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:51.060]   And that was it.
[00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:55.060]   All I knew was the God of the universe loves me.
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.060]   And that changed everything for me.
[00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:01.060]   And everything that I was bitter at, I was looking to see.
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:03.060]   Like, where do I fit in?
[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:05.060]   Who cares about me?
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:11.060]   But once I knew that I was loved by God, it changed everything.
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:16.060]   All my bitterness, anger, feeling of not belonging anywhere,
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:21.060]   instantaneously was answered by the love of Christ.
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:26.060]   In Psalms 36.9, it says, "In your light, we see light."
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:31.060]   It wasn't until I came out of the darkness and my eyes became open, I began to see.
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:37.060]   Now, as an adult, I look at my parents and how much they had to put up with me.
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:43.060]   And I can understand that as a father who's raised four children myself,
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:47.060]   the difficulties and frailties and our own shortcomings,
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:51.060]   and through all the trials that my parents went through, that they put up with me.
[00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:54.060]   And I understood. It's like, "Oh, they did love me."
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:59.060]   But I couldn't see that love until His love opened my eyes.
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:03.060]   It was in His light, I saw light.
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:07.060]   Until Christ comes and penetrates into our darkness.
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:14.060]   Just like the song says, "Looking for love in all the wrong places, looking for love in too many faces."
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:22.060]   It's a simple song, but that's a description of mankind that has fallen from the grace of God.
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:24.060]   To this day, it's a mystery.
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:28.060]   I cannot explain to you why He loves us, but He does.
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:30.060]   Because He says so.
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:35.060]   And no other explanation makes any sense, other than the fact that He loves us,
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:39.060]   that He would do what He has done for us.
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:43.060]   So for those of us who are brothers and sisters in Christ,
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:49.060]   when was the last time the love of Christ compelled you?
[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:55.060]   Look at your life, what you pursue, what you value, what makes you happy, what makes you sad.
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:48:00.060]   How much of the love of Christ is in the midst of that?
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:03.060]   Those of you who have been invited here as guests,
[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:11.060]   because your family and friends also wanted you to see and comprehend and understand the love of Christ.
[00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:15.060]   That if this is true, doesn't this change everything?
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:18.060]   Do you really think that all of this, everything that you've seen on this video,
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:24.060]   everything that you've studied about mankind, do you really think that this was just an accident?
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:27.060]   That everything that I'm saying, everything that you're thinking, all the relationships,
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:31.060]   past, present, and future, this is all an accident?
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:38.060]   Or just like Einstein and the majority of the scientists, that could there be a God behind all of this?
[00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:46.060]   And if there is a God, could it be that this God wants to have a relationship with us?
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:56.060]   That's what the gospel is. A holy God, for whatever the reason, who loved us, took on human form.
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:49:03.060]   He humbled himself. Not only did he become a man, he humbled himself to the point of being crucified on the cross,
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:08.060]   to take our sin upon himself, and he offers his salvation to all mankind.
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:15.060]   He who confesses his sins is faithful and just to forgive us of all our unrighteousness.
[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:22.060]   Only he can make you righteous. You cannot do good enough to pay off the sins of the past.
[00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:27.060]   Only Christ and his blood can cover us and forgive us and renew us.
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:33.060]   So the offer of salvation ultimately is an offer of his love for you.
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:41.060]   So our prayer this morning is that you would open your heart to God as well, to receive him.
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:49.060]   He is real. He's not somebody that just made it. It's not philosophers. It's not the disciples who wanted attention for themselves.
[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:59.060]   He is real. He died and he was resurrected on the third day to prove his love for us, to prove his identity.
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:03.060]   And he says the reason why he hasn't come back is because he's being patient,
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:09.060]   because he wants more of us to come to Christ, so that one day when he comes back,
[00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:14.060]   that we would be restored in this love relationship with him for eternity.
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:20.060]   Would you make that decision for him? Come to Christ.
[00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:26.060]   Maybe you've heard him from a distance. Maybe you've mentally acknowledged him like I did when I was younger,
[00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:34.060]   but I never really knew him. Would you consider to humble yourself before the Lord?
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:40.060]   Lord, I'm a sinner and I'm in need of forgiveness. Would you forgive me of my sins?
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:44.060]   Open my eyes that I may know you as well.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:50.060]   We pray that this morning that if you have any interest in knowing Christ,
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:54.060]   maybe you've been to church all your life and you've only seen him from a distance.
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:58.060]   You've acknowledged him, but you don't know him.
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:05.060]   So we pray that you take this opportunity this Christmas to really dwell upon the magnitude of what Emmanuel means,
[00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:07.060]   that you may also come to know him as well.
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:11.060]   So after service, our outreach team has set up a booth outside.
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:17.060]   Our pastor, Mark, is going to be out there. He's going to give a short summary presentation of the gospel.
[00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:22.060]   And if you have any questions and you just want to be there, there are some snacks there as well.
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:28.060]   We invite you, if you've been brought with friends and you just have questions about that,
[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:33.060]   we invite you to go and visit that area and they'll be able to answer any kind of questions that you have.
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:39.060]   And then for the rest of us to really commit to make this Christmas season about Christ,
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:46.060]   to think deeply about what it is that we confess so that our life and our confession would be consistent.
[00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:51.060]   So at this time, we're going to ask our—we have a special presentation this morning.
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:58.060]   So as they come and get set up, okay, so think about the lyrics that they're going to be singing as we watch them.
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:04.060]   So I'm going to pray for us as they set up, and then I hope that you will meditate and be blessed by it.
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:05.060]   So let's pray.
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:15.060]   Heavenly Father, we pray that your word would have a deep impact in our hearts.
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:19.060]   Save us, Lord God, from distraction.
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:26.060]   Save us, Lord God, from the sins of this world, from our temptations.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:40.060]   Lord Jesus, I cannot begin to comprehend why you volunteer to take my punishment.
[00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:48.060]   All we can do is to say thank you and praise you.
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:56.060]   I pray that as you are merciful with us, that you would be merciful, Lord God, to anyone else in this room,
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:53:00.060]   that they may also come to know you as well.
[00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:09.060]   That the powerful love that you showed us would continue to spread not only here, but everywhere you go.
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:12.060]   Everywhere we go, everywhere you send us.
[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:16.060]   May your grace be sufficient.
[00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:18.060]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:27.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
