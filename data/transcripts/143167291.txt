[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   reading from verse 5 down to verse 11.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Romans chapter 2 verse 5 through 11.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Reading out of the ESV.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   "But because of your hard and impenitent heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed. He will render to each one
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   according to his works, to those who by patience and well-doing
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   seek for glory and honor and immortality. He will give eternal life, but for those
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   there will be wrath and fury. There will be tribulation and distress
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   But glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   and also the Greek, for God shows no partiality." Let's pray.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Heavenly Father,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   we thank you so much for this morning. We thank you for your living word.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   We thank you for opportunities to praise you
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   where the body of Christ can come together, Lord God, and to express our
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   gratitude and worship. We ask, Lord, that
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   you would constantly keep our hearts and minds
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   fresh, that your word would speak to us and it would have its effect
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   that you've desired. So we ask for your blessing and your anointing over this time.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Now as you guys know, this week there was
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   a lot of news going on because of the shooting that took place in Oregon.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And again, this is happening so often now that we can
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   easily become numb. You probably
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   also read the news that this man was particularly
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   targeting Christians. And we don't know exactly what his state was and what the reason was.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   But every time this happens, there is a debate, political debate that gets stirred
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   up. Like we need to have some more regulations on firearms. That we need to
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   change the leadership. And we need to do this and we need to do that.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And I think we need to be careful that we don't get caught up with the rest of the world
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   thinking that if we somehow change policy, that if we change leadership,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   if we change our tactics, that somehow we are going to eradicate this kind
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   of stuff. Because ultimately, as Paul
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   has been reminding us through the book of Romans, the ultimate problem of man is not
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   external. That these things are not happening
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   because the world is bad and you just happen to step in it and
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   things are bad and just bad things happen to you. Jesus
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   clearly said, "It is not what you put into a man, but it is what comes out of a man."
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   The problem is not policy. Not to say that we
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   shouldn't make an effort to have a better government. That we shouldn't have better laws
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   to protect people. Not to say that those things don't matter. But
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   ultimately, the problem of mankind is not policy.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   It's not about certain laws. It's not if we change
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   our leadership, somehow we're going to have a utopian culture. And every year, election
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   year, we have people pounding, saying that if you elect me, I'm
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   going to change things. We're going to make things much better. We're going to have a better economy, better world.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Our children are going to be educated better. And everybody promises, but again,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   if you've lived long enough, there's a reason why people don't trust politicians.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Because they make all these promises, and every year, those promises
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   don't come true. Because the answer is not in man.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Our issue, and again, whenever
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   these tragic things happen, it's a constant reminder to us that we live in a
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   fallen world. These are the symptoms. And again, it's
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   not going to be the last time. It's not the first time.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   But then as Christians, we ought to be reminded that this is why
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   we need Jesus. This is why
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   we proclaim Christ, and this is why we gather together, and this is why we have hope
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   in Him. That it's a reminder why you and I need to be committed to the Gospel
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   of Jesus Christ. Paul introduces to the book of
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Romans of the necessity of Christ. And that's
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   what he's going to be, he's ultimately talking about by the time he gets to chapter
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   3 verse 21 and on, his goal is to
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   pound to these Christians already, who are already
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   believers of Jesus, but to pound in them the necessity of
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Christ. Now, for me to say this
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   in this setting, where probably, you know, maybe not everybody is a Christian, but
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   the majority of you in this room have already confessed your faith in Jesus.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   You believe in Jesus. You believe in the Gospel. And that's why you're here.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   That's why you're worshiping. So why do we need to hear, again,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   the necessity of Christ? Because
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   you and I have a tendency, because we live in this world
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   and what we tend to believe in or trust in are the things that we can
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   touch and taste and see. And obviously the things that
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   we profess to believe are not things that can physically touch.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   So if we're not careful we can easily drift in and our values
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   become no different than the world. Even though theologically that's not what we believe.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   But in practice we're no different than the world.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   So what He's been doing in chapter 1, 2, and 3
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   is to pound to these Roman Christians
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   why Jesus had to come.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Why Jesus had to die. It wasn't like, "Oh, He did such a
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   great thing, you know. He's such a good God because He
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   allowed us to have the easiest way to Heaven."
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   He came because He had to. There was no other way.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   You and I have absolutely had no hope without Christ.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   And so He pounds over and over again in chapter 1,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   verse 18, all the way to chapter 30, is why the wrath of God
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   is being revealed today. Why whenever you see things like that,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   the shootings and the beheadings and the hatred and all these things, why this
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   is happening? He said, "Because the wrath of God is being revealed."
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   He said, "Because God revealed Himself and mankind
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   chose to worship the creation rather than the Creator." And as a
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   result of that God gave them over, it says, to their lustful passions,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   sexual immorality, to all kinds of rebellion against God.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   He said He passed them over. And He said last week
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   that, "Do you not realize," in verse 4, "that it's His kindness
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   that leads us to repentance?"
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Every single one of us who've heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ and repented
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   is because God had mercy on us. It wasn't because you had made the right
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   decisions. It wasn't because you were smart enough and you made the right friends and
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   chose the right church, or you studied the Bible and you were smarter than the other people.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   He said it was completely by the mercy of God.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   He was kind to you. He somehow orchestrated your
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   lives so that you may hear the Gospel. He orchestrated certain people in your lives that
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   may be a witness in your life. It's His kindness that
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   leads you to repentance. Verse 5
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   is again an ongoing indictment against these self-righteous
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   hypocrites. And He says, "But because you don't recognize that that's exactly what
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   it is, that God's kindness leads you to repentance, but because of your heart
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   an impenitent heart." In other words because you refused to repent.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   You refused to acknowledge your sin and
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   your need for Christ. He said, "For yourself on the day of wrath." That you are storing
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   up wrath for the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   In other words if you refuse to repent, not
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   recognizing it is God's kindness that's leading you to repentance, and you're going to rely
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   upon your own self-righteousness, He says in verse 6, "He will render each
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   one according to His works."
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   You know it's a cruel, cruel joke in life.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Again I wouldn't even call it a joke, but you know to
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   live all your life thinking that if I'm good enough that
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   somehow when I die God's going to be fair and allow me to get into Heaven.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   And there's again when we talk about religion
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   versus Christianity, if there's one fundamental distinction
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   between not just religion but secularism versus Christianity
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   is that as long as we are decent people
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   that when we die the just thing for God to do
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   is to allow us to get into Heaven. But the problem with that
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   is just like we talked about last week and what I said in the beginning
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   that sin is not something that you just step into.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   That we're all born neutral and somehow if you make the right decisions
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   that somehow you're going to be able to be free and live clean the rest of your life.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   That's not what the Scripture says. It says it's what comes out of
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   we've come out of our mother's womb unclean.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And again anybody who's raised children you know
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   exactly what I'm talking about. You know you don't teach children how to sin.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   You have to teach them how to restrict themselves from sin.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   You have to teach them the punishment of sin.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   You never taught them that. You didn't teach them to steal. You didn't teach them to lie and to cheat.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   You didn't teach them to be selfish. You're trying
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   really hard. In fact some days you feel defeated because you're working so
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   hard to teach them not to sin.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   But they came into this world with that instinct. And that's
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   you and I. Every single one of us. We came into this world with the instinct to be
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   selfish. Instinct to lie. Instinct to boast.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   And as a result of that He says there's condemnation.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   See in Romans 2, 8-10 it says, "For those
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness, there will be
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   wrath and fury. There will be tribulation and distress for every human
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek." It says every
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   evil deed. When's the last time you considered sin
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   as evil? In fact in our world, in
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   our culture we often call it a mistake.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   An error. But evil?
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   In God's perspective in His holy, holy, holy eyes
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   He says what we act out is a rebellion
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   against God. And therefore in His eyes it is evil.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   In Matthew 12, 36-37 it says, "I tell you on the day of judgment
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   people will give account for every careless word they speak.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   For by your words you will be justified and by your words you will be
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   condemned." Is Jesus serious about that?
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   If you and I were to come before God and to be judged
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   by our deeds, He says not only will you be judged by whether you
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   committed an act of adultery or whether you stole and lied, He says every
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   careless word. Now some of you guys are more
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   tight-lipped than others, you know. And I confessed to you before that this is
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   probably one of the main things that I repent of more than anything else.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   At night before I sleep, "Stupid dummy, why did you say that?"
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   "Oh, you're trying so hard to make yourself look better than you are."
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   And you say, "I mean I see it, I see my sins."
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   But no matter how tight-lipped you are, it's not even just about what you say, it's the
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   thoughts that you have. It's anger, the lust.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Imagine if we stood before God, a holy God who is omniscient and omnipotent
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   who knows everything and says, "Ok, now come before me and I will
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   judge you and give you what you deserve."
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   What a fearful thing to fall into the hands
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   of a holy, holy, holy God. But again,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   you and I already know that we
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   will not be judged. That when we come before God, the blood of Christ
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   covers us. That our faith, our salvation is not by our works.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   And if you've, again, been to church for any period of time, you know that that's true.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   That's Christianity 101. If those of you are members, if you didn't
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   know that, you would have failed BCC and you wouldn't be here. Right? That's
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Christianity 101, that you and I are not saved by our works. Thank God that
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   God doesn't judge us according to our works. It is absolutely
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   by faith. The same man who says in verse 6,
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   "He will render each one according to his works," also says
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   in Romans 3.23, "For we hold that one is justified by faith
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   apart from the works of the law." That's the same guy.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   The same guy who wrote this text is the same guy who wrote that. Romans 9.30,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   "What shall we say then, the Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   attained it." That is a righteousness that is by faith.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And again, in another text, in Ephesians 2.89,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   you know that passage, "For by grace you have been saved through faith,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   and this is not your own doing. It is a gift of God,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   not as a result of works, so that no one may boast."
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Now, it is the same author. It is the same author who said,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   "Those who by patience and doing well, or
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   good works, seek glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   life." And he is the same guy who said, "But glory and honor and
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek."
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   How do you reconcile that? Because in this passage it seems like he is saying
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   those of you who are doing good works will be saved, and those of you who are not doing good works you are going to face
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   tribulation. Did something happen between chapter 2 and chapter 3?
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Did he have a new revelation from God? And he said, "Ok, I changed my mind."
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   You know I know I told you just three paragraphs before
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   that you have to have good works to be saved, and then Azor has nothing to do with good works.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   What happened? Did he change his mind?
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Obviously not. What I want to talk to you about today for the rest
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   of this time that we have, maybe about 20-25 minutes,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   is this relationship between faith and works and why this is not a contradiction.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   The Scripture clearly says
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   that we are saved by faith and not by works. In fact
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   if you add works to your faith you are perverting the Gospel.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   That's blasphemy. Basically what it is, it's like well you know I'm going to
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   take the work of God and then I'm going to add some of my work.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   It's offensive to God. If there was any other way that we can get
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   to Heaven by our works, to say that, "Oh, Jesus was
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   just one of the ways that I could have gotten to Heaven. He needed my help.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   The God of the universe did His part and now I've got to do a little bit of my part."
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   It is absolutely ridiculous. That is not what the
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Scripture teaches. The Scripture is clear on that. It is by
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   faith and by faith alone. The whole book of Hebrews
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   is to teach us that. It is by faith and by faith alone.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   If there was any confusion about this, again I think
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   come and talk to us we'll try to clarify it. But again the Scripture is not ambiguous
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   about this at all. There are some things
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Christians can debate about but this is not one of those things. This is not a debatable issue.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   It is by faith and faith alone. But then if that's the case
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   what does Paul mean here? How can he use this language?
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   "To those who by patience and well-doing seek glory and honor and
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   immortality He will give eternal life." It sounds
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   like you are earning your salvation. What could he possibly mean?
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Well to illustrate this
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   point, again because this is the main point, I want you to turn your Bibles to
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   John 6.29. Some of you guys are very familiar with this
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   text because I've gone through it before. But John 6.29.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   And I want to show you the relationship
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   between faith and works. And why faith and works
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   cannot be separated.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Again you guys say, "Well that sounds blasphemous." But I'm going to
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   show you why. Even though the Scripture clearly says that we are saved by
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   faith alone, but why faith and works cannot be separated.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   John chapter 6. The setup for the
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   passage I'm going to read are these 5,000, probably the real number is about
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   20,000 including women and children. They are
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   the ones who ate the miraculous bread and fish, and
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   they are the people in the feeding of the 5,000. After they are fed
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Jesus goes to the other side of the lake and they say, "Where is Jesus?" So they go look
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   for Him. They finally find Him and they encounter Him. And
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   verse 25 Jesus sees them and He sees that
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   there is a defect in their faith. They see
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   that they are following Him for the wrong reason. So He is going to call them out. And that's the
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   text that we are looking at in verse 25. "When they found Him on the other side
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   of the sea, they said to Him, 'Rabbi, when did You come here?'" And Jesus doesn't
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   answer. He goes, "I came yesterday." No small talk. He just jumps right in.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   He said, "Truly, truly I say to you, you are seeking
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Me not because you saw a sign, but because you ate
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   your fill of loaves." Stop right there.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   "You are coming to Me not because you recognize who I am. You know the
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   signs that I gave. You said I'm the Messiah and so we are coming because
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   of the promise and you are the Messiah. That's not why you are
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   coming. You are coming because you ate and you are full and you want more."
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   So He corrects them and He says, "Do not labor for
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life."
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   So Jesus is saying, "Don't work for temporary things.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Work for eternal things, which the Son of Man will give to you, for on
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Him God the Father has set His seal." Right? So again
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   He is correcting their defected faith. He says, "You are seeking
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   for temporary things like food, but what you really need to be seeking is eternal
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   things." Right? That's what you need to be doing. Then they said to Him,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   "If that's the case, what must we do to be doing the works of
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   God?" Say, "We are doing the wrong thing. You should do the right
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   things. So what is the right thing that you want us to do?" Verse 29, "Jesus
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   answered them, 'This is the work of God, that you," what? "Believe."
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   "That you believe." He said, "Well what should we
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   do? You ought to do what is right." "Well what should we do?" "Believe,"
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   He says. In fact He says that over and over again. He says that
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   again in verse 35, right? He says,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   "Jesus said to them, 'I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me shall not
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   hunger. Whoever believes in Me shall never thirst.'" Again He says
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   to come and do the work, "Believe." Verse 40
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   again He says, "For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   looks on the Son and believes in Him should have eternal life, and
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   I will raise Him up on the last day." Verse 47,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   "Truly, truly I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   I am the bread of life." So, what is Jesus doing with these people?
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   They are coming and they are exerting a lot of energy to come
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   to Jesus, but they have a defective faith because they don't recognize who He is.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   He says, "You are working for things that are going to rot, and it's going to mean
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   nothing. So, you need to work for things that are eternal. What should I do? What is the work
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   of God?" He says, "You must believe." And He repeats this over, and over, and over,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   and over again to get His point across. Now to fully understand
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   the result of this belief in His teaching, after
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Jesus says this, and this is where He recognizes that
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   they are not His. They are coming to Him for all the wrong reasons.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   So, He basically shuts the door on them by telling them that if you don't
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   drink of My blood and eat of My flesh you cannot be My disciple. And so, they are like,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   "What? Like cannibalism." He doesn't explain Himself.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   So, basically what Jesus is doing He is shutting the door because He sees
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   that they are coming to Him for the wrong reason. He doesn't see the faith.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   So, He turns to His disciples and He says, "Are you going to leave too?"
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   And look what they say. Starting from verse 66,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   it says, "After this many of His disciples turned back and no longer walked with Him.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   So, Jesus said to the twelve, 'Do you want to go away as well?' Simon Peter
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   answered, 'Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   and we have believed and have come to know that you are
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   the Holy One of God.'" What was the difference between the disciples and the people turned away?
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   The disciples believed and they did not.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   And as a result of that, because of their unbelief, they turned away from God.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   And because of the belief that they had,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   did the disciples understand what Jesus was saying? They didn't get it either.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   You know, they say, "Oh, you've got to drink My blood and eat
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   My flesh." I'm sure the disciples are like, "What? What did He say?"
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Jesus just said to eat His flesh.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   I don't get it. I don't get what you are saying. And that's why
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   they didn't get it. When Jesus said He was going to go to the cross He said, "I don't get that.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   You are the Messiah. I'm convinced that you are the Messiah. You are the Holy One of God.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   Why would you go to the cross? That doesn't make any sense." But they didn't leave
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Him because they believed. The difference between
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   again what Jesus is saying here is that you and I, again in
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   our generation we have a tendency to separate
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   the faith and works so clearly that
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   anything that you say, "Well, Christians ought to do this." It's like, "Oh, that sounds like legalism."
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   You know, that's not God because the Gospel of Jesus Christ says it's by faith alone.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   So anything that tells us that we need to do
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   something we automatically have a knee-jerk reaction. That's why when we read passages
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   like Romans 2 it sounds like heresy.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   How can He possibly say that? How can He possibly tell us that our works matter?
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   I thought it didn't matter. I thought our
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   life and what we did didn't matter because we're saved by
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   faith alone. So our works do not matter.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   And yet the Scripture is so crystal clear on this subject.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   See what Jesus was saying to His disciples,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   to them, He says, "Yes, you do need to seek for eternal things, but
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   again, but the greatest of these things that you need to do is to believe because it is belief
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   that causes you to work. It is belief that causes you
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   to work." James 2, 18-20. Someone will say,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   "You have faith and I have works. Show me your faith apart from the works and I will show you
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   my faith by my works. You believe that God is
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   one, you do well, even the demons believe and shudder."
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   In other words, what James is saying is you guys are all good at professing,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   but when it comes to evidence there is none. Faith without deeds
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   is useless. That is not saving faith. He says, "Even the demons believe that God is one,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   they shudder." In fact, in Jesus' ministry it was the
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   demons who first recognized Jesus, not the disciples. Demons
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   are the ones who came and knelt before Jesus, you know, and they were
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   in terror because they recognized who He was. The disciples were like, "Great,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   you know, we get free food. You know, when you go to Heaven, you know, can I
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   sit on the left or the right?" The demons recognized Him first.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   They don't fully open their eyes until His death and resurrection.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   So he says, "If it is simply a profession that Jesus wanted,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   then the demons should have been saved." See, the faith that Jesus
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   is referring to is a faith that causes them to follow Christ
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   through the cross. And it is this
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   defected faith that these people were coming to Jesus
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   that caused them to turn away from Christ. Now what does this have to do with the passage?
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Turn back with me to Romans chapter 2.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   If you see the difference between 7 and 8, it says verse 7 is
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   in reference to Christians, and verse 8 is in reference to non-Christians.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   So I want you to see the difference between the Christian and the non-Christian.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   "To those who by patience in doing well seek
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   for glory, honor, and immortality, He will grant eternal life.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   But a non-Christian, but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   truth but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury."
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   So the distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian, they are
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   both seeking. Right? In most of your translation, the word
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   is translated "seek." So a Christian is seeking glory, honor,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   and immortality, which is going to lead to eternal life. And that's why they're going to
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   persevere in their good works. A non-Christian is self-seeking.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   So therefore, they're not going to obey the truth and obey unrighteousness.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   There will be wrath and fury. In the end,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   both of them are seeking life.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Both of them are seeking life. A non-Christian, the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   is a non-Christian thinks that life is here.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   So therefore, if I work hard enough, make enough money, make proper decisions, put away
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   enough money, then my life is going to be good, and I'm going to have a better life.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   So they're self-seeking. They're trying to exalt themselves,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   which is at the core of their rebellion against God. Refusing to
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   acknowledge God as Lord, and decided to worship the creation
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   rather than the Creator. Now what creation does he worship?
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Himself. A Christian is an individual who
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   recognizes that life is eternal.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   So he is seeking glory, honor, and immortality. And as a result
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   of that, he will receive eternal life. So a Christian is an individual
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   who believes that life is in Christ.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   And because I find life in Christ, I seek to be where Christ is.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   I seek to do what Christ does. I seek to go where
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   He goes. Because I find life in Christ. That's the distinction
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   between a Christian and a non-Christian. It is not a difference between coming to church
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   and not coming to church. Someone can come to church
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   and be completely self-seeking. It's about them.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   As soon as I don't get what I want, this church
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   doesn't do anything for me. Because even in the context
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   of Bible study, even in the context of serving the church, it could
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   be self-seeking. You just happen to find a different avenue.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   See that's why Scripture says in 1 Corinthians chapter
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   13, He said, "Without love it is nothing." Because all of these
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   things, even me preaching up here, it may seem noble
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   and honorable, but it could be self-seeking.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   And that happens all the time. People go into ministry for self-seeking reasons.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   People go evangelizing for self-seeking reasons. People serve and give to the church
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   for self-seeking reasons. The difference between a Christian and a non-Christian
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   is what he believes is going to bring life to him.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   A Christian believes that life is in Christ
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   and that now we are hidden. Our glory is hidden in
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Christ. And we will be glorified one day when Christ comes and He is glorified.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   And we will be glorified in Him. Therefore, I am investing
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   long-term. See that's what he is saying.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   He says an individual who is patient in doing good,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   who perseveres in doing good. Why do you have to persevere in doing good?
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Because you don't see the payoff right away. If your good
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   works automatically lead to something good for you, you don't need to be patient. You just need to
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   do the work and tomorrow you get payoff. The reason why you need to be patient in doing
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   good is because the payoff or the reward is later.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Satisfaction comes later. That's why he says the one
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   who is patient in doing good is because he is seeking
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   glory, honor, and immortality. And as a result of that
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   he will have eternal life.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Let me tell you again, let me illustrate why this is so important.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   You know in the church, when we
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   talk about following Jesus Christ, we automatically
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   compare it with whoever we are around. So a certain
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   culture, so if you are a member of a community church, there is a certain culture that is required of you.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   So as long as we meet that cultural minimum,
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   we feel okay. So it's like how are you doing spiritually? Ah, you know
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   I did the Bible study. I haven't done this. I haven't done that. Whatever is the cultural norm of
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   this culture. But whenever Jesus saw
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   something defected in their action, whether it was the disciples or
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   the villages that He went to, He recognized a defect in their faith.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   He said, "Ye of little faith, why couldn't you trust Me?"
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   When they were afraid, He said, "Oh, why are you afraid?" He said, "Ye of little faith."
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   When a centurion came, He said, "You know what? Send them. I have servants that follow
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Me." He said, "Oh, you have to descend. I believe that you have that authority." He said, "This man has
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   great faith." In other words, what was Jesus saying?
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   He's saying, "Your faith is leading you to
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   be fearful or not fearful. It is your faith that's causing you to be
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   disciplined or not disciplined. It's faith that's causing you to value Christ over
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   the world. At the core, it's your faith."
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   That's why in Hebrews chapter 11, 6, "Without faith
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   it is impossible to please Him." Because what God is looking for is not
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   just somebody to jump through the hoops and do the right thing. He says
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   without faith, just like all the people who are coming to Jesus, superficially
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   you would think that, "Wow, look at this crowd, 20,000. You know, they're
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   coming to Me. That's great. We have a successful ministry." But He looked right
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   through them. He says, "No, this is not real fruit. They're coming to Me
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   for all the wrong reasons. You must first believe. Without
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   faith it is impossible to please Him, for whoever would draw
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   near to God must first believe that He is."
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   That He's the answer. That when Jesus said,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   "Come to Me all who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest."
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   That you believe that Jesus is your rest. Not your
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   vacation. Not your trips.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Not to Jimjilbang and rest or whatever you may think.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   Jesus is our rest. When Jesus said, "If you drink of this water
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   that the world gives you, you're going to be thirsty again. But the water I give you,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   you'll never thirst." And because you believe that, and you believe that He is,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   so you continue to come to Him and drink. That you recognize your
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   hunger. There's something that you're missing. And so when Jesus says, "If you
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   eat of this bread you will be hungry again. But the bread that I give you,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   you will never hunger again." And you believe that. And because you believe
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   that you come and you eat of Christ and you drink of His blood.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Because that's where you and I find life. That's what He means. If you don't
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   believe that, there's no way for you to please God. He who comes
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   to God must first believe that He is and He rewards those who
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   seek Him. See that's the connection to what He's saying in verse 7.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Those who are seeking Him, they seek honor, glory,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   and immortality. And they will get eternal life. That because you believe
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   that He is and He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Paul is not contradicting himself. What Paul is saying
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   is genuine faith is what's going to cause
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   us to seek Him. Here's the trouble
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   that again that we get into sometimes. Because we get, you know,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   "Ah, you know works and knee jerk reaction. That's legalism. That can't be from God.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   That's not the Gospel." Let me tell you why it is
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   a contradiction to separate works and faith.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   You and I profess to believe in a
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   fantastic Gospel. It is not something that
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   you and I would even imagine to create.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Imagine if you just conjured up this idea.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   If you wrote a story. I mean you can understand like, "Oh, there's a great movie.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   The king comes off his throne and he lives with the peasants. Like, wow!"
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   You know, really some king actually would do that?
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   These aren't just any peasants. These are the peasants who rebelled against him. These are the peasants
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   who are constantly attacking him, cursing him, and wants to destroy his
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   kingdom. It's that that king instead of being angry decided to come
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   down and live among them and have mercy and sacrifice. And not only did he love them
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   so much that he would sacrifice his son to win them over to bring them
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   into his kingdom. And he said, "Really?
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   That really happened?" Say, "Yeah, okay. That's maybe in Hollywood."
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   The Gospel that you and I profess
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   to believe is that it wasn't the king of some nation,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   earthly nation. It was a God of the universe
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   who created the world. The very oxygen that you and I
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   breathe. That God that we were
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   rebelling against decided to take on human flesh
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   and he walked among us. Not only did he walk among us,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   he was humiliated. He was beaten. He was mocked.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   And he was crucified. All for what?
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   To save a rebellious, stiff-necked people.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   You and I are saved because we believe that.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   As fantastic as that is, this is not a story a human
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   being would make up. Because you wouldn't possibly think, "Who would believe
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   this? If I made up a story, even if I told you a king did that, I don't know if
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   they would really believe that. Let's make it realistic.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   Let's make it realistic that they were cute orphans and it wasn't
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   really the king. It was just a jester in the court. That's more
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   believable. But a king? A rebellious people?
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   For them to make up a story about a God who did that? Who would believe this story?
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   And yet, you and I believed it. And we were changed.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Our destiny was changed forever.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   And we sing these songs. We memorize scripture.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   We tell other people about it. And so we believe this fantastic story.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Professing we are saved because of it. And then
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   we hear a passage, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   and all these things shall be added unto you." It's like, "Ugh, that's hard to believe."
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   That's hard to believe.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   Think about the inconsistency
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   of what we profess. The magnitude of the gospel that you and I
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   profess to believe. And the day-to-day unbelief
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   that we accept as normal.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   You see how faith, how
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   inconsistent a life that doesn't produce works and the faith
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   that we profess in Christ does not fit.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   And that's why he says in Romans 8.32, "He who did not spare his own son,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   things?" If you believe that he would give his only begotten
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   son, and we profess this every single Sunday,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   and then to leave this room saying, "I'm not sure if he would
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   take care of my bills. I'm not sure if I pick up my cross
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   and follow him that he has my best interest. I mean, I say it, but I don't know if I really believe
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   that." That's just like if I was a manager of a bank
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   and you came into work and said, "You know what I'm going to give you the keys to this vault
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   where we have piled up billions of dollars
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   and I'm going to entrust you with this key." And it's fantastic,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   but don't ever touch this cash register. We have
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   about $300 of cash in there and I don't trust you enough.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   You know, I said, "What? You wouldn't trust me with this vault, but you won't
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   entrust me with this cash register?" Something's off.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Something about that guy's faith doesn't as well. Maybe the vault really doesn't
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   have the money. Maybe the real money is in the cash register, and that's why you're saying this.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   See, something is off. See, a Christian who professes
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   to believe this grand story of the God of the universe
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   would give his only begotten son and to receive that so
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   flippantly and say, "Yes, I believe that. Of course, no problem." And then to struggle
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   every single day to follow Jesus because I don't believe
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   the little stuff. You see why
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   faith and works has to be together?
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   If that faith is genuine, you will see
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Christ. If you believe that Jesus is the living water,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   why would you not come drink from Him?
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   If you believe that He's the bread of life, you really truly believe that,
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   why would you not eat of Him? If you believe that life is found
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   in the Word of God, and you profess that, why would you not come
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   and read it?
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   We accept the Gospel
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   and just assume that I have it,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   and then the rest of it we're just kind of wrestling with, "Maybe I need to be more disciplined.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   I've got to do that." But in the end,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   it may be our faith.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   And that's why he says, "Do you believe?"
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   And my encouragement to us this morning is, "Do you believe?"
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   If you believe that life is in Christ,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   wouldn't you be following Him?
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   If you believe that you're satisfaction in Christ,
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   wouldn't you want to be near Him? If you're
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   thirsty, and you feel something off, you know what, life isn't what you thought it
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   was, and you graduated, and life is hard, and things are difficult, and something
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   feels off, that possibly, maybe
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   there's a spiritual hunger, that you haven't been walking right
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   with God, there's a spiritual thirst, and you believe that
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   the only one who can quench that, and you believe that, is Jesus,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   why would you not come to Him?
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   Why would you not drink of Him? And this
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   is why, again, when we talk about prayer, prayer is a privilege, it's an opportunity
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   to come to a holy, holy, holy, omnipotent God,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   and instead of prayer being a power for us,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   it becomes a burden, a guilt.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   Because we don't see it
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   as an opportunity to meet God, we see it as a
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   duty to do, because that's what a good Christian does.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   You see the difference between believing and not believing?
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   Not believing, and going through the motions,
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   kills us. But if you believe,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   if you believe that He is the living water, the closer
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   you get to Him, the more you will live.
