[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.320]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.120]   If I could just ask that for your help a little bit,
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.320]   if we can just try to squeeze in a little bit
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.760]   to the middle of each row, if you can, for today.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.520]   That would be greatly appreciated.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.320]   But with that said, let us begin our worship service
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.560]   this morning with praise.

[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.020]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.360]   Before we get started,
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.020]   we have an announcement from our Sisters Ministry,
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.680]   and I forget who was supposed to come up here.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.160]   Okay, Grace is gonna come up and give the announcement.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.320]   (audience applauding)
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.280]   - Hello, church family.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.280]   My name is Grace.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.480]   I have all my support of my family here.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.000]   Hey, I just wanna let you know,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   it's that time of year again.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.840]   We're excited to share that our Women's Ministry
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.400]   will be hosting our annual Film-O-Ship event.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.660]   Can I get a raise of hands?
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.840]   How many of you have come to our past Film-O-Ships?
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.120]   Hey, pretty good.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.080]   Does any of you remember what it stands for?
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.520]   Oh, okay.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.520]   So Film-O-Ship stands for fellowship,
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.760]   inspiration, legacy, and movie.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.500]   So memorize that for next year.
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.680]   So it's gonna be taking place on October 8th from 9 to 12,
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.920]   and it's gonna be taking place around the movie,
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:56.960]   "The Dropbox."
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.360]   How many of you guys have seen "The Dropbox?"
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.520]   Only a few?
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.600]   Oh, it's so good.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.680]   Okay, well, maybe you were here maybe like five,
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.500]   six years ago, 'cause we did actually play that movie.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.680]   But for those of you who don't know what that is,
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.800]   it's actually a documentary based on a pastor
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.040]   who saw a great need to save the infants
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.520]   who were pretty much being abandoned
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.560]   and discarded in his neighborhood.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.960]   But he found an ingenious way to save these precious babies
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.600]   and bring hope to many families.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.200]   So we just hope the sisters are able to come
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.420]   and be inspired to see how the love of Christ
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.720]   can really compel his people to follow in his footsteps,
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.440]   in his love and sacrifice.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.920]   The cost is $3.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.040]   There's gonna be payment options in the signup link,
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.280]   so go ahead and check that out.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.640]   There should be an email coming up.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.800]   It will be posted on the various social media sites.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.240]   And please sign up fast, as this is a very popular event.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.880]   And if you have any questions, please email Nicole Chun.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.400]   Is Nicole here?
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.240]   You wanna raise your hand?
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.960]   See, Nicole, ah, look at that.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.180]   She is pretty much putting this all together,
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.400]   so go and find her.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.240]   (laughing)
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.740]   And I just gotta say, for the sisters coming,
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.100]   for those who are married, who have children,
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.180]   we gotta get our husbands, brothers, uncles,
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.700]   whatever it is, to help watch your kids
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.140]   so we can have a good time, right?
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.980]   So we're gonna list the men's help as well.
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.860]   So anyways, thanks so much, and we hope to see you there.
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:12.700]   Thanks.
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.860]   (audience applauding)
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.140]   - I'm gonna leave the other announcements
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.460]   for you guys to kinda check again.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.500]   There's quite a few things that are going on at churches.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.620]   Keep that in mind.
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.160]   A main thing is our Wednesday Bible study,
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.620]   or weekday Bible study, Second Peter,
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.420]   is starting up again this week.
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.260]   And so those of you guys who are new to the church
[00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.940]   and you don't know where to go, as soon as you come in,
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.500]   you know, if you haven't checked out our new cafe area,
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.780]   that's where our main Bible study,
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.860]   Wednesday Bible study is gonna be happening,
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.020]   please be mindful of where you're parking
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.020]   because we do not have the same permission
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.260]   during the weekday to park behind us or a certain area.
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.060]   So just make sure that you follow the signs
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.860]   and wherever is designated for parking that you park.
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.140]   And then on Wednesdays,
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.980]   and Wednesdays our parking on site is available,
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.860]   meaning that normally on Sundays we kinda shut it down
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.640]   because of the number of children that are running around,
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.580]   but Wednesdays we do have parking here.
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.380]   Just don't park in the courtyard,
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.280]   but anything outside of that, you can park here,
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.700]   and then again, you'll see the parking attendants
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.540]   that are coming.
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.080]   There's gonna be quite a few people here,
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.920]   so you may have to, again, park down the street
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.220]   and then walk over here if you come a little bit later.
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.040]   The home groups are also starting this week,
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.060]   starting from Tuesday, Wednesday.
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.300]   I don't think we have anything on Thursday,
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.460]   but on Fridays, if you signed up
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.340]   and you didn't receive any information
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.400]   of where you're supposed to go, please let us know.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.860]   Maybe you kinda fell through the crack
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.100]   or somehow your name got misplaced.
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.460]   Let us know and then we'll give the information
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.300]   of where to go.
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.460]   So even if you're on Wednesday
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.860]   and you haven't received anything,
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.540]   please email us and we'll be able to direct you
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.460]   to where you need to go when you come on Wednesday.
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.180]   So obviously this Wednesday and this Tuesday,
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.000]   you know, the various Bible studies that we're having,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.420]   it's gonna be a little bit more chaotic
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.780]   because we're starting anew,
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.780]   and again, we have quite a few new people
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.140]   who have been added to the various things
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.540]   that are going on, and so please help us.
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.620]   Try to come a little bit earlier,
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.020]   and if you are new and you come a little bit later,
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.820]   it's gonna be difficult for us to place you,
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.420]   so try to come a little bit earlier.
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.400]   So Wednesday, we're starting at seven,
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.660]   so I'm gonna ask you to come at least 15, 20 minutes earlier
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:23.500]   so that you can find your seats and see who is with you
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.620]   so we can get started right at seven o'clock as possible.
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.460]   Okay?
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.940]   All right, other than that,
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.820]   I'll leave the rest of the announcements
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.220]   for you to look at on our apps or church website.
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.540]   Let me pray for our offering,
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.540]   and again, if you are here visiting
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.380]   and you have a physical offering to give,
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.780]   we have a box over there under the clock,
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.820]   and then if you're new to the church,
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.380]   we encourage you to visit our welcome table.
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.900]   As you are coming into the campus,
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.900]   you saw the welcome sign,
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.700]   and that's kind of where our welcome team
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.060]   is gathered together, and they'll take your information
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.780]   and answer any kind of questions that you may have.
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:58.620]   Okay?
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.460]   Let me pray for us,
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.900]   and then I'll give you a minute or two
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:01.780]   to give your offering.
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:02.620]   Let's pray.
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:08.060]   Father, we thank you so much for your continued grace
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.460]   and love that you pour upon us,
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.580]   things that we are aware of,
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.020]   things that you are doing behind the scenes, Lord God,
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:19.300]   that we have full confidence that you are a sovereign God,
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.020]   that you work all things together for good,
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.740]   for our sanctification, for your glory.
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.560]   So we pray, Father God, that even in this offering,
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.740]   help us to give cheerfully for the purpose of worship
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.140]   and the purpose of furthering your kingdom.
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.540]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:36.380]   Amen.
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.040]   (gentle music)
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.620]   (gentle music)

[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:30.800]   Church, may we let us stand together
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.200]   as we continue our worship.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:39.460]   (gentle music)

[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:46.740]   Amen, before our next song,
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:50.320]   I'd like to read for us from Romans 8, one to four.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.620]   Therefore, there is now no condemnation
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.740]   for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.980]   The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.260]   has set you free from the law of sin and death.
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.020]   For what the law could not do,
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.780]   weak as it was through the flesh, God did,
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.940]   sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.700]   and as an offering for sin.
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.960]   You condemn sin in the flesh
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.380]   so that the requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.540]   who do not walk according to the flesh,
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.580]   but according to the spirit.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.820]   And in Galatians 3, 13,
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.300]   Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law,
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.340]   having become a curse for us.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.180]   For it is written,
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.700]   cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.580]   in order that in Christ Jesus,
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.540]   the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.660]   so that we would receive the promise of the spirit
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.860]   through faith, amen.

[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.480]   Death was once.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:14.140]   ♪ Death was once my great opponent ♪

[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.220]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter three,
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.800]   we're gonna jump back into the text here
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.600]   in Luke chapter three verses one, two.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.720]   It's one to six.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.260]   I'm just gonna reread for the first three verses.
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:05.560]   This is a two-part message that I'm gonna finish next week.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.180]   Okay, Luke chapter three, one, two, and three.
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.600]   I just wanna kinda give you a heads up.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:15.000]   I forgot to inform you this at the announcement.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.740]   In about two weeks, not next Sunday,
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.000]   but the Sunday after, we are going to be moving
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.080]   our cry room to the other building.
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.920]   So where our former cafe is,
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.840]   so we're taking the next couple of weeks
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.200]   to set up that room.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.040]   And so it's gonna be much more spacious.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.960]   There's gonna be a live feed that's going on in there.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.220]   So that we can, again, we're gonna be using that area
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.280]   for an overflow from this room.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.720]   But the cry room, we're gonna make it,
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.680]   again, we're trying to get that made
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.120]   so that the parents with small children,
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.840]   those of you guys who are in the room right now,
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.620]   in two weeks, will be moved to that location.
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.380]   And along with that, because our youth group
[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.820]   is having worship in that room,
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.540]   we ask that you not go in there.
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.500]   Don't take your children in there to play
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.780]   during the second service,
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.420]   because there's an actual worship that's taking place
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:00.820]   in the corner of that building.
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.980]   So only go into that room if there is some business
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.740]   or you have to go meet one of the pastors or something
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.020]   or something like that.
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.620]   But please do not use that room
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.380]   to kind of let your children run around,
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.060]   because there's a youth group worship
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.560]   that's taking place in that room.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.140]   Otherwise, the cafe is big enough
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.340]   where you guys can kind of hang out in that area, okay?
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.080]   All right, let me look at Luke chapter three,
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.700]   verses one, two, and three, reading out of the NASB.
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.260]   Now in the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.780]   when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea,
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:32.540]   and Herod was the tetrarch of Galilee,
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:33.940]   and his brother Philip was tetrarch
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.260]   of the region of Iturea,
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:41.260]   and Trachonetus and Dysanias was tetrarch of Abilene.
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.340]   In a high priest of Annas and Caiaphas,
[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.660]   the word of God came to John,
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.820]   the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness.
[00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.160]   And he came into all the district around the Jordan,
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.920]   preaching a baptism of repentance
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.660]   for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.500]   Let's pray.
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:58.480]   Heavenly Father, we pray that your Holy Spirit
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.280]   would anoint this time,
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.960]   let your word and your word alone go forth,
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.440]   convict us, guide us, restore us,
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.920]   that we may be true worshipers
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.760]   that worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.360]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:17.220]   All right, as we are introduced to John,
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.260]   again, John was introduced as an infant
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.620]   earlier on in the book of Luke,
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:24.100]   and there is a long period of silence
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.940]   that we don't know much or anything about John the Baptist
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.740]   other than the fact that he was raised
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.860]   in the wilderness and his parents.
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:32.240]   And so now we get to chapter three,
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.580]   as he begins his ministry,
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.000]   we are introduced to John the Baptist and his ministry,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.180]   and so we're gonna be covering the first part today,
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.940]   and then his message next week.
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.520]   But it's interesting that it begins
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.620]   by highlighting some very prominent people
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.180]   of that generation.
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.180]   You have the emperor of Rome, Tiberius Caesar,
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.980]   Pontius Pilate, who was the governor of the region,
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.740]   Herod, the king of Israel,
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.780]   Annas and Caiaphas in three different parts,
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.100]   and then you have the two high priests,
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:04.580]   Annas and, again, Annas and Caiaphas.
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.660]   And each one of these people on their own
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.380]   were famous, powerful people.
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.620]   So you would think that if you were to read this
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.420]   in the first century and you saw their names,
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.860]   that there would be something about them
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.600]   that they would explain,
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.300]   and somehow how John was connected to that
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:21.560]   and how he benefited from it.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.240]   But looking at it now, 2,000 years later,
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.740]   they're just mentioned because they're trying
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.620]   to introduce John the Baptist.
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:31.980]   The real key figure here isn't Caesar.
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.940]   It's not the governor, it's not the high priest,
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.520]   it's not the king of Israel,
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:39.200]   but this obscure guy who was in the wilderness.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.500]   No money, no prominence, no education,
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.800]   coming from a poor family, most likely.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.920]   And he's the guy who's highlighted.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.600]   You know, one thing that this reminds me of
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.440]   is all of human history, whether it's Egypt
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.680]   or whether it's modern history,
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.300]   all of it is redemptive history,
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.240]   and every government and every historical thing
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.160]   is basically in line with how it's connected
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.360]   and what God is doing.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.440]   So human history is not about Egypt,
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.760]   it's not about the Middle Ages,
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.120]   it's not about what happened,
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.600]   whether good or bad, or communism or capitalism
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.920]   and who's going to win.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.580]   At the end of it, these guys are all side things
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.240]   that are happening in the context
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.440]   of what God is doing in history.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.200]   At that particular time, it would have been strange
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.280]   to say all of these people are mentioned
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.840]   because they're trying to introduce John.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.200]   Again, in human history, maybe nobody,
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.480]   but in redemptive history, he's the greatest
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.400]   of all the prophets, as Jesus says.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.140]   John the Baptist is a unique figure.
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.760]   You know, those of us who think of John the Baptist,
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.540]   who maybe have studied John the Baptist
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.360]   or read about John the Baptist,
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.120]   I mean, we could say superficially, right,
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.480]   at least from what we know, he was a dead serious guy.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.440]   I don't ever see him telling jokes, you know?
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.080]   Like, you see Jesus, like, laughing
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.000]   and playing with children and, you know,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.680]   hanging out with his disciples, eating,
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.880]   but John the, all we know about John the Baptist
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.040]   is he's out in the wilderness,
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.960]   he's eating some serious food, wearing serious clothes,
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.760]   right, and his message is repent, right?
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.920]   And then once he's done, he dies and he disappears.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.000]   The whole presence of John the Baptist,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.820]   every part of who he was, was an indictment against Israel.
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:24.280]   Like, I could imagine, like, John the Baptist,
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.800]   just by showing up somewhere, it got serious, right?
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.980]   Just the fact that John the Baptist was coming,
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.280]   I think it caused them to think, like,
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.720]   what am I doing wrong?
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.600]   If my life is not straight, what should I do?
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.640]   He's a very serious figure.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.200]   We're gonna look at today John's particular calling.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.680]   There's four things that I wanna highlight
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.180]   in this text, in the introduction,
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.440]   and one is the calling of John.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.400]   What made his calling so unique?
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.240]   And second, the timing of his calling,
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:58.240]   and what does that speak to about why John was sent,
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.720]   and then third, the place of his calling.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.360]   Even the place where he was called
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.140]   and where he grew up has significance,
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.860]   and then fourthly, the message of his calling.
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.180]   So this morning, I'm gonna look at the first three,
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.660]   and then we'll take some time next week
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.140]   to talk about the fourth one, about his message.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.620]   But first one, the calling.
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:18.340]   John the Baptist's ministry, it begins by saying,
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.640]   in the text, after introducing all of these people,
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:24.560]   that the word of the Lord, word of God, came to him.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.020]   Now today, if we just listen to that superficially,
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.620]   without understanding the context of that phrase,
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.380]   we may just think, oh, God called him,
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.860]   or God spoke to him, but what's interesting
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:38.180]   about the word here for word,
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:40.860]   typically when we see the word word in the New Testament,
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.700]   what's the word that we think of as in Greek?
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.020]   Logos, right, logos.
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.620]   The word that is used here for the word
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.900]   is not logos, but rhema.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.700]   I think the easiest way to understand,
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.700]   and it's not comprehensive,
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.140]   it's much more nuanced than this,
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.420]   but the easiest way to understand what's happening here
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.340]   is the word rhema, the distinction between that and logos
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.940]   is logos is kind of like the written word, right?
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.860]   It is the word, it's a universal,
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:09.940]   it's spoken to everybody in particular.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.740]   I mean, it is the word of God itself, right?
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.460]   In the beginning was the word, word was with God,
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:18.100]   word was God, all of the statements there are all logos.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.540]   Here the word is rhema.
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.900]   Rhema is in reference to the spoken word,
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.100]   in particular to that particular person.
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.460]   Now even with that definition,
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.420]   it may not make a lot of sense,
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.760]   but the first century Jew would have clearly understood
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.140]   when they saw that statement that John the Baptist,
[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:38.340]   the word of the Lord came to him,
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.260]   the word of God came to him,
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:44.980]   they knew that this was a distinct calling of a prophet.
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:49.580]   The word came to him, that phrase is used
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:51.980]   whenever you see a prophet being called
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:55.720]   to speak on his behalf, it introduces that prophet
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.940]   by saying the word of God came to him.
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.140]   First Samuel 15, 10, the word of the Lord came to Samuel.
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.280]   Second Samuel 7, four, the word of the Lord came to Nathan.
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:07.340]   First Kings 16, one, the word of the Lord came to Jehu.
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.780]   Jeremiah 1, two, the word of God came to Jeremiah.
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.780]   Ezekiel 1, three, the word of the Lord came to Ezekiel.
[00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:15.300]   Jonah, the word of the Lord came to Jonah.
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.740]   The word of the Lord came to Haggai.
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.640]   The word of the Lord came to Zechariah.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.660]   Each one of these prophets has specifically called
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.260]   the phrase, the introduction that these are people
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.180]   sent by God, it is introduced to us by saying
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.460]   the word of the Lord came to him.
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:33.460]   God specifically called that individual.
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:36.460]   The reason why this is significant is that the last time
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.220]   that phrase was used to refer to a prophet
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.700]   or the last prophet of the Old Testament
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:46.700]   didn't come to Israel until before 425 years ago.
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.940]   That means over 400 years.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:53.380]   There wasn't a prophet for the nation of Israel.
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.580]   And God warned the nation of Israel
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.780]   that because they continued to sin in the book of Amos,
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.260]   he says that there's gonna be a famine.
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:04.400]   But it's not a famine of food, it's not famine of water,
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.020]   it's gonna be a famine of the word of God.
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.920]   That people are gonna be staggering from place to place,
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.540]   but God's not gonna send his servant to preach
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.340]   so that people would not know.
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:17.460]   That's what happened for 400 years.
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:22.060]   So when the text says that John the Baptist was that prophet
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.860]   a first century Jew would have understood
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.300]   that God is breaking into his silence.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.940]   That he's not like the Pharisees.
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:33.140]   He's not like the priests and the scribes
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.300]   who are taking and regurgitating information
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:36.540]   that they may have had.
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:39.540]   In fact, much of the teaching of that time
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:42.540]   was not even the Bible at all.
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:44.140]   It was just a lot of their opinions,
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:48.540]   a lot of their thoughts and added traditions.
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.820]   So when they accused Jesus of breaking the law,
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.660]   it wasn't the law that the Lord was breaking,
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.420]   it was their tradition that they added to the law.
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:59.980]   See, when here it says that John the Baptist come
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:02.860]   and the word of God came to him is that God is speaking.
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.620]   In other words, pay attention to what he has to say.
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:08.380]   There's a reason why almost every letter
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.980]   in the New Testament is introduced to us
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:13.100]   by saying Paul an apostle of God,
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.260]   or bond servant, or a slave.
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:17.820]   And he's not simply giving his title,
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:22.220]   he's saying what I'm about to say to you is from God himself.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:25.780]   The Holy Spirit is using me to write and to speak to you,
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.940]   but I'm sent by God.
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.780]   These are not my words, these are not my opinions,
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.940]   it's thus sayeth the Lord.
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:36.560]   And so that's how John is being introduced to us here today,
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.220]   that his calling as a prophet for 400 years,
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:42.020]   as an indictment and a judgment against Israel,
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:44.860]   the prophet was not sent and all of a sudden it was time.
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.080]   And so John is gonna appear
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.780]   and he's going to bring the word of God to them
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.120]   to prepare for the coming of Christ.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:56.740]   Secondly, the timing of John's calling.
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:59.540]   Every part of this passage where it says,
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.900]   "15 year of the reign of Tiberius,
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.780]   "when Pontius Pilate, the governor of Judea,
[00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.660]   "Herod was tetrarch of Galilee,
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:09.140]   "brother Philip, the tetrarch of the region of Echeria,"
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:13.920]   and on and on, he mentioned all these prominent people.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:18.920]   And he says, again, every time a prophet is introduced,
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.860]   it was common practice that they would tell us
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.620]   exactly when they were prophesying.
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.780]   In Haggai chapter one, one,
[00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.740]   it's in the second year of Darius the king,
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.100]   on the first day of the sixth month,
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.180]   and tells us very specifically
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:34.500]   when these prophecies are taking place
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.680]   and in what context these prophecies are taking place.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.740]   So if you ever study the Old Testament,
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:40.700]   especially the prophets,
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:43.300]   you have to know what's going on in history.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.780]   Or else it'll sound, one book,
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.340]   it's gonna sound exactly like the other book.
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:50.820]   And that's probably, if you've ever read it
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.980]   without understanding the historical context
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.980]   in which the prophet is speaking,
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.580]   it just sounds like God's gonna judge you,
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:57.640]   you better repent.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.260]   God's gonna judge you, you better repent.
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:03.300]   Then Hosea, God's gonna judge you, you better repent.
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.420]   Ezekiel, God's gonna judge you, you better repent.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:07.260]   That's what you end up hearing.
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:10.260]   So if you read one, you read the other,
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.380]   it doesn't sound any different
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.980]   until you know the specific context.
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.840]   And in what particular sin are they being judged for?
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:20.580]   And when they're being judged,
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:21.980]   how are they gonna be judged?
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.140]   And what's the result of that?
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.260]   And what is the promise that's going to come?
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:29.320]   And so when the historical context is introduced to us,
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.260]   it helps us to understand the message
[00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.360]   that they're giving specifically.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.700]   And so John is no different.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.220]   When John is introduced to us,
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:39.540]   when all these people are laid out for us,
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:40.580]   there's a reason for that.
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.820]   It's not just to give us a specific timeline.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:47.220]   It happened 33 AD or 37 AD.
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.140]   And so there's a lot of debate as to,
[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.560]   is it 33, is it 36, is it 28?
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.660]   That may be interesting,
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.260]   but the real reason why I believe this is here
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:37:00.540]   is because it gives us the historical spiritual context
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.780]   in which John the Baptist is breaking in
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.220]   and bringing the word of God.
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.340]   So what is the context?
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:08.340]   Well, in Galatians 4.4 it says,
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:12.060]   "When the fullness of time has come."
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:13.660]   When the fullness of time came,
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.620]   God sent forth his son, born of the woman,
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:16.980]   born under the law.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.420]   What made this, what made this particular period
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:24.100]   in Israel's history the fullness of time?
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.500]   That's an important question
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.140]   because God ordained this particular,
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:34.260]   it was not random that Jesus came at this particular time.
[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:37.940]   He said God allowed what he has ordained to take place,
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:41.580]   and when it was fulfilled, it was the fullness of time.
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.180]   Everything that he was waiting to do,
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:46.020]   everything that he had ordained to happen has happened.
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.500]   So all the groundwork that needed to take place,
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.540]   he said, has happened,
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.920]   and that's why now John the Baptist is coming
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.060]   and Jesus is coming.
[00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.760]   So the question is, what happened?
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:00.060]   So some people will say, well, the Romans took over
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.860]   and they made the roads easier to travel on,
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.540]   they had similar language,
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:08.660]   and they had political connection
[00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.140]   'cause they conquered so much land,
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.260]   and all that is true,
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:16.520]   but he could have done that 1,000 years before.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:17.920]   He wasn't waiting for the Romans,
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.660]   like, I can't wait 'til the Romans get here
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.180]   'cause we need the roads and we can't travel,
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.440]   we can't share the gospel without roads.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.140]   They go to other places, they can't learn their language.
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:28.340]   That may be the case,
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.020]   that may be a benefit of the Romans
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.900]   being in power at that time,
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:34.780]   but the Bible spells out.
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:37.860]   He said the fullness of time is because
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.280]   the law was given for what purpose?
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.120]   To make sin utterly sinful.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.660]   So if there's anything that the Bible
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:49.020]   specifically points to is allowing the sin
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.960]   to have its full effect.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:55.300]   The full effect of sin had to come.
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.500]   Why did that have to come?
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.940]   Because in order for light to come into the world,
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.660]   they need to be able to recognize the light,
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:06.180]   and sometimes when it is dim,
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.980]   you don't appreciate the light.
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:12.740]   And so God was waiting until the darkest part of the day
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.300]   in order for the light to come.
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.500]   I mean, this is not my guess, the Bible says that.
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.540]   When sin has become utterly sinful.
[00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:26.340]   So how do these people who are in power points to that?
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.860]   Well, as you guys know, in the Old Testament,
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:32.180]   when the prophets came, the warning was very similar.
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:35.680]   If you do not repent and turn from your sins,
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.540]   the penalty that he says over and over again
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:41.180]   through different prophets, through different generation,
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.260]   is that you're gonna lose your country.
[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:47.860]   Foreigners are gonna come and take your men and your women,
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:50.380]   and they're gonna make them their servants.
[00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:54.140]   And you're gonna serve as servants
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:55.980]   under their dominion and their power,
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.500]   and you're gonna end up worshiping their gods.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.660]   And prophet after prophet after prophet,
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.580]   the same warning was given to them,
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.980]   and they did not turn.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:11.980]   So 735 BC, the Assyrians come in and take over the land,
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.620]   and then after that, the Babylonians come.
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.460]   After that, the Persians come.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.060]   After the Persians, the Greeks come.
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.220]   After the Greeks come, then the Romans have come.
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:25.220]   So over 700 years, they were dominated by a pagan nation,
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.900]   just like the prophets said.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:31.060]   So when we are introduced by telling us,
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:32.820]   but it was a time of Caesar,
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.020]   to us, it may just be a historical event,
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:38.200]   but to a Jew, it's a reminder to them of their sin.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.820]   They're in that situation because of their own sins.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.040]   And that's what the prophets kept on telling them.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.340]   Pontius Pilate was a governor,
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:48.220]   and he was the one who actually had the power
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:51.060]   to carry out crucifixion and judgment.
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:56.060]   So if Israel ever rebelled against Rome,
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.780]   Pontius Pilate was the one who would gather the soldiers
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.080]   and he would oppress them.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.740]   And so when they heard Pontius Pilate,
[00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.580]   he was the one who was carrying,
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:07.020]   he was the one who was crucifying their neighbors.
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:10.060]   Herod, Philip, the Senes,
[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.340]   these were the kings of Israel.
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:14.780]   They divided up the kingdom into different parts
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:16.340]   so that they can share the kingdom,
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.940]   and their great grandfather, or grandfather,
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:22.460]   Herod the Great did this so that they can retain their power.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.740]   So you remember Israel,
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:27.440]   Israel's kingdom was unlike any other kingdom,
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:32.020]   because in every other kingdom, the king is the king.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:36.360]   But in Israel, the king was a servant of the real king.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.020]   So remember, that's how Saul got into trouble.
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.980]   He was established as the first king of Israel,
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.720]   and he acted like any other king.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.100]   He went and got whatever he wanted,
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:48.060]   he did whatever he wanted, and he didn't obey God.
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:49.820]   And as a result of it, he gets rejected,
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:51.580]   and God brings in the second king.
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:52.900]   And what does he say about David?
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:56.380]   He's a man after my own heart.
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:58.760]   Meaning he's a king that's gonna represent me.
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:02.820]   See, by the time Israel is under the rule
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:05.940]   of Herod and his brothers,
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:09.340]   these guys weren't even Israelites.
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:11.860]   I mean, forget tribe of Judah, they weren't even Israel,
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.620]   they were Idrumeans.
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:17.540]   They were foreigners, basically,
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.180]   that the Roman government established
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:24.220]   in order to use them to suppress any rebellion
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.660]   that might come from their country.
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:30.960]   So the fact that you had Idrumeans ruling over them,
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.300]   every day was a reminder to them of their rebellion.
[00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.580]   And they're in that situation
[00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:37.160]   because of their sin.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.380]   But as bad as all of that was,
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.580]   the people who did the most damage to the nation of Israel
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:45.360]   were these two high priests, Annas and Caiaphas.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.580]   We don't know for sure,
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.780]   but according to early church historians,
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:51.180]   they believe that Annas and Caiaphas
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.680]   weren't even from the tribe of Levites.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:57.540]   Just like their king, just like these foreign rulers,
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:01.180]   they had no rightful authority over Israel.
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:05.700]   Annas actually was a retired high priest.
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.180]   And in order to maintain his power,
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.580]   he established his son-in-law, Caiaphas.
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.740]   So by law, there's only one high priest,
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.560]   but by that time, they said Annas and Caiaphas
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.860]   were co-reigning because Annas
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:18.160]   didn't want to let go of his power.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.580]   So automatically, that tells you
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.860]   that this was not about worship,
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.060]   was not about keeping the temple pure,
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.800]   it's not about worshiping, following God,
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.140]   it was about their own power.
[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:31.500]   And that's why when Jesus came,
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.660]   Jesus was a threat to their power.
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:36.500]   And that's why they had to get rid of him.
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:38.700]   It wasn't because, oh, he broke the law
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.420]   or he's not following our tradition.
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.540]   Ultimately, Jesus was calling them out of their sins
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.780]   and challenging their power,
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.380]   and so they would do anything to retain their power.
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:53.340]   And as a result of that, they end up killing Jesus.
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:56.020]   So every one of these rulers was a reminder
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:57.740]   to the nation of Israel
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:59.880]   that sin has become utterly sinful.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:04.220]   The weight of sin has been carried out to its peak.
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:07.900]   And so at Israel's darkest period of time,
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.940]   light comes, John the Baptist.
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.180]   John chapter one, verse one, it says,
[00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:14.740]   "He came to his own, and those who are his own
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.100]   "did not receive him."
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:17.540]   That's how dark it was.
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:21.740]   The light came and they didn't even recognize it.
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:23.700]   They talked about the coming Messiah
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.540]   probably more than any subject.
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:30.320]   I think they talked about the coming Messiah
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:35.320]   like Dodgers fans during World Series, if you make it.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:40.920]   I mean, I think the topic of the Messiah
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.400]   was at every conversation because every struggle,
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:48.860]   every problem was gonna be solved when the Messiah comes.
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:49.880]   Financial problems.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:52.600]   When the Messiah comes, there's gonna be no poor.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.120]   There's gonna be no sickness.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.320]   There's gonna be no foreign nations.
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:58.600]   So every time they felt any kind of effects of their sin,
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.020]   they said, "The Messiah's coming,
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.860]   "and the kingdom of he's going to come.
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.900]   "No one's gonna be hungry, no one's gonna be tired,
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.360]   "no one's gonna be crying."
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:09.920]   So I believe that the topic of the Messiah
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:13.360]   was on their tongue constantly,
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:17.700]   and yet when the Messiah came, they did not recognize him.
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:22.080]   That's how far they drifted from God.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.480]   Even though they talked about God,
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:25.580]   even though the temple was in full swing,
[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:28.440]   the Romans allowed them to worship
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:29.920]   the way they wanted to worship.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.520]   They had synagogues scattered all over the Roman world.
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.640]   Remember, wherever Paul would go to preach the gospel,
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.000]   he would go to the synagogue where the Jews are,
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.200]   and they were allowed to give worship there freely,
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.520]   and yet with all that time spent
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.320]   talking about God and the Messiah,
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:51.120]   when the actual Messiah came, they did not recognize him.
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:56.420]   In Luke chapter 9, 22, Jesus says,
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:58.800]   "The Son of Man must suffer many things
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.620]   "and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:02.000]   "and the scribes and be killed
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.760]   "and be raised up on the third day."
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.520]   Do you notice how Jesus says when he's rejected by Israel,
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.460]   he specifically points out the leaders of Israel?
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:12.480]   He doesn't just say, "Israel's gonna reject me,
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.780]   "the unbelievers are gonna reject me,
[00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.380]   "the people who are chasing after ideas
[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:17.220]   "are gonna reject me."
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.060]   He repeats it over and over again,
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.800]   "The leaders of Israel is going to reject me."
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.480]   The reason why he says that is because
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.180]   it wasn't just a pocket of people.
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:32.280]   That's how far that they were led astray by these leaders,
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:36.240]   by the false prophets, and by their own lusts and their sins
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:39.340]   that even in the context of worshiping God
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:42.220]   and making sacrifices, they knew nothing of God.
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:45.220]   They didn't know him,
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:48.200]   even as he was standing in front of them.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.540]   They didn't recognize him.
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.980]   The timing of Jesus' coming
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:57.140]   was at the darkest of Israel's history.
[00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:02.140]   Jesus says in Matthew 16, one through four,
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.820]   "The Pharisees and Sadducees came up and testing Jesus,
[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:07.940]   "they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.360]   "But he replied to them,
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.360]   "when it is evening you say it will be fair weather
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.480]   "for the sky is red.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.440]   "And in the morning there will be a storm today
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.880]   "for the sky is red and threatening.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.140]   "Do you know how to discern the appearance of the sky
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:24.420]   "but cannot discern the signs of the times?"
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:28.260]   We are warned over and over again
[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:29.660]   that not to be caught off guard
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:32.060]   like a thief that comes in the night.
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:33.380]   He said for the rest of the world,
[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:35.740]   the thief comes and it is unwelcome.
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.320]   When the thief comes, they come to break in
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:40.500]   and take the things that are valuable to you,
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.180]   the things that you were treasuring,
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:43.800]   the things that you have locked up,
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:46.100]   they're gonna come and get it.
[00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:48.140]   Things that you have worked so hard to get
[00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:49.580]   for years and years and years,
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:51.360]   they're gonna come and destroy all of that.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.580]   And he tells us, make sure that you do not get
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.140]   caught off guard like the thief.
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:59.940]   Because the first coming of Jesus was exactly like that.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:04.740]   Jesus came and he disturbed their peace.
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.220]   Everything that they hoped for,
[00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:09.060]   Jesus came and he ripped it out of their hands.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:12.140]   And as a result of that, they rejected him.
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:16.780]   He says, "How come you're able to tell the signs
[00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:19.020]   "of the times when the weather is changing?"
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:23.300]   I mean, think about our generation, right?
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.040]   Is the crypto gonna go up or down?
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:28.860]   Is it a good time to buy a house or not?
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:32.460]   What field of education should you go into?
[00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:34.460]   What school do you wanna go to
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:37.140]   in order for you to get the best jobs?
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:38.700]   What company should you join?
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:40.420]   Where should you live?
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:42.180]   Where are you gonna get the most bang for your buck
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.180]   for your house?
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:46.780]   You know the signs of the times that you can read
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:48.980]   and if you are savvy,
[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:52.020]   that you become, the older you get,
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:53.940]   you become better and better.
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.020]   How to invest your money?
[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.460]   Raise your kids, where to buy the house,
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:00.860]   when to sell, when to buy.
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:04.340]   But he says, "When it comes to spiritual matters,
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:08.060]   "you're blind, you're so dense.
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:11.080]   "The son of God is standing right before you
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.160]   "and you don't even recognize him."
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.620]   That's what Jesus was saying.
[00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:19.500]   See, the time that John the Baptist came,
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:20.880]   Israel was that blind.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:26.380]   Obviously, there's an application to this.
[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:29.700]   You and I live in a free country
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:35.660]   where we can worship God freely like no other people ever.
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:40.980]   I know that, you know, we've been so pampered.
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:42.340]   They say, "You can't say Merry Christmas."
[00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:44.420]   Merry, we can't say Merry Christmas!
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:47.220]   I can understand the Indian pastors
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:48.300]   who are dying for their faith
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.540]   'cause they won't let us say Merry Christmas.
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:53.900]   I mean, that's where you and I live.
[00:49:53.900 --> 00:50:00.180]   Because we're, let's admit it, we're snowflakes.
[00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:01.500]   Right, I know that's a political term,
[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:05.400]   but we're all snowflakes, let's admit it, right?
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:08.340]   Because we've been free for so long,
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:12.080]   we come to church and think about the things
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.860]   that we complain about, this is too far,
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:17.140]   not enough parking, the bathroom's not good,
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:20.140]   and we don't have this program, we don't have that program.
[00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:23.220]   I mean, you and I are pampered, let's admit it.
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:26.580]   The things that we complain about, they would laugh at.
[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:32.100]   I mean, literally laugh at in other parts of the world,
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.500]   literally risking their lives
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.060]   to come and gather together to worship God.
[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:42.060]   But as a result of these blessings,
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:45.860]   we have also become blind.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.600]   Like what matters, what doesn't matter,
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.100]   what's true, what's not true,
[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:52.980]   what honors God, what pleases God.
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:56.980]   How many of us are aware of our own hearts,
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:01.020]   our own greed, our own lusts, our own pursuits?
[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:04.540]   Is Christ truly Lord over our life?
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:07.700]   I'm not saying do you confess it.
[00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:08.660]   I'm not saying do you remember,
[00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.820]   I'm not saying do you serve it,
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.180]   I'm not saying do you type.
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.720]   Is he really Lord?
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:15.720]   Is he the Lord that I serve?
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:18.200]   Or did we just pick and choose
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.040]   what we can establish as Lord and what we can't?
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:25.400]   See, Israelites were in that state
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.660]   for hundreds and hundreds of years.
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:30.960]   And so the hardening of their hearts
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.960]   to the point where they can't even recognize Jesus
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.200]   did not happen overnight.
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:40.680]   It was decades, centuries after centuries,
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:41.780]   and passed down tradition.
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:43.680]   So when they told Jesus,
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.120]   you're not even obeying the law,
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.880]   and they couldn't even recognize what was the law
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.640]   and what was things that they made up.
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.120]   That's how far they drifted away from God.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:56.160]   John the Baptist breaks into this
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:58.620]   because he's gonna stir up the pot.
[00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.800]   In order for Jesus to come,
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.540]   they needed to recognize where they've gone wrong.
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:07.920]   They needed to know what sin that they're under
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.760]   and why they needed a Savior.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:11.980]   They needed to know that.
[00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:13.620]   And they hated John the Baptist
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:15.860]   as much as they hated Jesus.
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:19.660]   In fact, Jesus did, John the Baptist did such a great job
[00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:20.900]   that when he was transitioning,
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.500]   people were asking, oh, is he the Messiah?
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.960]   And then when John came on, Jesus came on the scene,
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.200]   they asked, oh, maybe he's John the Baptist.
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:32.100]   I think there is some physical resemblance
[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:34.020]   because they were cousins.
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:37.380]   But for the most part, what they said and what they did
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:40.140]   and how they lived and how they made their disciples
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:43.460]   looked so similar that they couldn't distinguish
[00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:44.860]   from a distance who he was.
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.460]   That was John the Baptist.
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:49.700]   In order for him to prepare for the way of coming of Christ,
[00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:52.220]   he said what Jesus said, he did what Jesus would do,
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.720]   he went where Jesus would go.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:57.340]   And he came up to stir the pot.
[00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:00.460]   People who hated Jesus hated John the Baptist.
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:03.780]   And people who loved Jesus also loved John the Baptist.
[00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:08.460]   His very presence was a stumbling block
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.100]   to the nation of Israel.
[00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:11.680]   Especially to the leaders.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:16.100]   The place of John's calling is also something
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:17.760]   that we need to recognize.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:18.720]   Wilderness, it says.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:23.000]   The word of God came to John the Baptist in the wilderness.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.740]   Wilderness in the Old Testament is a very prominent place
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.760]   because remember when Moses,
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:33.660]   he was in the palace in Egypt, in Pharaoh's palace.
[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:35.620]   And they say, well, if you can get trained
[00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:37.780]   to lead the nation of Israel,
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:40.740]   where's the best place to get training
[00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:41.940]   to be the best leader?
[00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:45.360]   Well, I mean, he's in Pharaoh's house.
[00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.380]   They had the best education, best technology,
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:50.620]   best training that you could have gotten in the world.
[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:54.500]   And yet God orchestrates him to go out into the desert,
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.980]   to the wilderness for 40 years.
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:01.020]   And completely strips him of any pride.
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:04.020]   Anything that he thought would have been useful,
[00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:05.940]   he just completely strips him of that.
[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:07.540]   And he knows nothing for 40 years
[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:09.540]   other than to take care of these sheeps.
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:13.740]   And it was at the end of that when he was ready.
[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:18.180]   That even when God called, it's like, you don't want me.
[00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:20.840]   'Cause I'm not trained.
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:22.420]   Maybe if you called me 40 years ago,
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:25.500]   but I believe God sent him out into the wilderness
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.660]   for that very reason.
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.840]   God doesn't need Pharaoh's education.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:32.640]   God doesn't need his training.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:35.700]   He wanted to be empty.
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:36.540]   Empty.
[00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:39.340]   And I believe that the best person
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:43.000]   that God can use for his kingdom is people who are empty.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.260]   Empty, no pride, no agenda.
[00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:51.180]   Just come before God and say, here am I, send me.
[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:54.940]   He says in Timothy, right?
[00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:56.620]   If you want to be prepared for noble purposes,
[00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:57.980]   what does he say?
[00:54:57.980 --> 00:54:59.920]   Get rid of ignoble things in your life.
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:00.760]   That's what he says.
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:02.700]   He doesn't say get training, go to seminary.
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:03.540]   He doesn't say all that.
[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:06.980]   He doesn't have to say that those things don't help.
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:09.900]   All he says is if you want to be used for noble purposes,
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:11.180]   get rid of ignoble things.
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:12.300]   It's the ignoble things.
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:13.660]   It's not what you need to get,
[00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:15.160]   it's what you need to get out.
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:20.660]   John the Baptist grew up in the wilderness.
[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:23.620]   Wilderness is not a place of education.
[00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:28.120]   Wilderness is not a place where you go to get rich.
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.580]   You don't make connections in the wilderness.
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:35.620]   You don't have proper systems in the wilderness.
[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:36.580]   They just lived in caves.
[00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:40.540]   In fact, we don't know much about John the Baptist.
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:43.140]   All we know is that, again, extra biblical material
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:45.580]   tells us that John the Baptist, or John,
[00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:48.460]   Yohanan, is mentioned in some document
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:49.820]   in the Qumran community.
[00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:52.100]   And the only reason why we know anything about this
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:56.060]   is because they found Dead Sea Scrolls in their community.
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:58.180]   And so they became prominent as a result of that,
[00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:00.060]   but outside of that, we know nothing.
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:02.740]   John the Baptist just grew up in the wilderness,
[00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:04.140]   in the caves, and then when it was time,
[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:05.220]   he just walked out.
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:08.620]   And he began to baptize, began to preach.
[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:10.620]   I believe the practical reason why he was out
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:14.020]   in the wilderness is away from the reach of the leadership.
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:18.400]   Remember when Jesus was beginning to preach?
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.220]   His own brothers asked him.
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:23.020]   And it says, because they didn't believe,
[00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:24.400]   well, if you wanna be famous,
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:29.400]   and you're doing all of this stuff, go to Jerusalem.
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:32.140]   Nobody preaches out in Galilee.
[00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:35.380]   I mean, where are you gonna go in Galilee?
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:37.380]   You can't become famous, you can't become prominent,
[00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:39.300]   you're not gonna become a member of the Sanhedrin
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:40.980]   out in Galilee.
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:43.820]   Go to Jerusalem, because he did not understand.
[00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:48.460]   It was very deliberate that he was out in Galilee,
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:50.380]   and it's very deliberate that John the Baptist
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:51.840]   was out in the wilderness,
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:56.260]   because he came to challenge the leaders.
[00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:59.180]   He came to challenge the system.
[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:02.060]   He didn't come to get their approval.
[00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:06.340]   He didn't come to rise up under their system,
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.380]   that one day they would become somebody prominent
[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:09.200]   within their system.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:10.700]   In fact, John the Baptist calls out,
[00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:12.100]   and we'll get into that next week,
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:15.740]   and he challenged that, you guys are brood of vipers.
[00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:19.060]   You need to repent, and you need to be serious
[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.100]   about your repentance.
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:22.540]   And instead of going into Jerusalem,
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:26.020]   he began to call them out into the wilderness.
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:29.140]   In Luke chapter 21 through seven, it says,
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:30.700]   on one of the days while he was teaching,
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:32.220]   while Jesus was teaching at the temple,
[00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:35.780]   challenging the system himself, preaching the gospel,
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:37.660]   the chief priests and the scribes with the elders
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:40.660]   confronted Jesus, him, and they spoke, saying to him,
[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:44.220]   "Tell us by what authority you are doing these things,
[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:46.180]   "or who is the one who gave you the authority?"
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:47.520]   Jesus answered and said to them,
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:51.900]   "I will also ask you a question, and you will tell me,
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:54.820]   "was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?"
[00:57:56.460 --> 00:58:00.060]   Jesus knew exactly what he was doing,
[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:01.540]   because they can't answer him.
[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:03.820]   And the reason why they can't answer him
[00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:06.220]   is because if they say John the Baptist is not from heaven,
[00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:08.740]   there's all these people who love John the Baptist,
[00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:12.460]   how can you say that about the prophet,
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:14.700]   one of the greatest prophets that we've seen?
[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:19.140]   If they say he is from God,
[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:20.940]   then why did you treat him that way?
[00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:23.520]   So it was a trick question,
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:27.860]   because Jesus knew that all of these leaders
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:30.560]   were functioning under the fear of man.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:34.840]   They weren't serving God, they were serving themselves.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:36.560]   They were saying things and doing things
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:39.320]   because they knew that that would gather
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:41.120]   attention for themselves.
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:44.360]   And as a result of that, because they were fear,
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:46.120]   they were functioning under the fear of man
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:48.400]   and their own greed.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.200]   That's why they emphasize certain things
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.060]   and not emphasize certain things.
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:55.120]   Just like today.
[00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:57.640]   Just like today.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:02.120]   Well, you hear certain things because it's beneficial
[00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:04.480]   for the people in the room.
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.640]   And there's certain things you don't hear
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:08.840]   because the reaction you're gonna get.
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:12.700]   Even in our church,
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:15.720]   most of the times that I get thanked,
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:16.960]   and I'm not saying all the time,
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.420]   I'm not indicting all of you,
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:23.340]   I know which sermons get the best praise.
[00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:27.100]   One, it has to be shorter.
[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:27.940]   That I know.
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:30.500]   That'd be shorter.
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.660]   It has to be 30, 35 minutes.
[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:35.060]   I usually get thank you when it's shorter.
[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:38.020]   I rarely get a message if I go 50 minutes.
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:39.920]   They're usually quiet and just walk by.
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:43.460]   It's usually about your suffering,
[00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:45.560]   the Lord loves you, He cares about you,
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:49.760]   that despite your sin, that He loves you unconditionally,
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:51.300]   and He will never forget you.
[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:53.060]   None of that is false.
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:56.520]   And there are texts that emphasizes that.
[00:59:56.520 --> 01:00:00.340]   But there are also plenty of texts of warning.
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:04.740]   There's plenty of texts about judgment,
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:05.800]   consequence of sin.
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:13.460]   So my natural inclination, if I'm not careful,
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:15.220]   would gravitate toward that.
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:17.140]   So if I gave topical messages,
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:21.060]   I might every once in a while feel the weight of guilt,
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:22.940]   like I should preach the whole counsel of God
[01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:25.180]   and go to the judgment every once in a while.
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:29.220]   But most likely, four out of five times,
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:31.340]   it would be the other side.
[01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.620]   And that's why I think the benefit
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:33.880]   of preaching through the Bible
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.620]   is I don't dictate what you hear.
[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.820]   The text dictates, tells you what you need to hear.
[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:43.740]   See, James chapter three one says,
[01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:45.900]   "Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren,
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:50.080]   "knowing that as such we will incur a stricter judgment."
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:53.260]   Man, this hit me like a ton of bricks
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:54.660]   when I was getting ordained.
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:59.060]   Now, the funny thing was, it wasn't before I got ordained.
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:00.700]   It was as I was getting ordained.
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:05.260]   Do not strive to become a teacher
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:07.460]   'cause you're gonna be under stricter judgment.
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:08.900]   There's nobody in this room
[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.060]   that will be under stricter judgment than me
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:14.780]   because I preach every week,
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:16.580]   'cause I represent the word of God.
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:20.060]   I am more tempted than anybody in this room
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.140]   to be a man pleaser.
[01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:23.580]   I am more tempted.
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:26.140]   'Cause I say certain things,
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:27.940]   I know the response that I'll get.
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:31.140]   And the larger the church gets,
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:34.180]   we have more good, but we also have more criticism,
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:35.540]   and it all comes with the territory.
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:36.380]   So I am tempted.
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:38.940]   I am tempted more than anybody else in this room
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:39.900]   to pretend.
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:45.140]   To pretend like I'm doing well when I'm not.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:48.540]   To present myself in such a way
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:51.900]   that it may or not should be true in real life.
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:55.220]   Because the more I speak and the more I present
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:58.900]   in an ideal manner, the more benefit that we get.
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:06.460]   But a man of God must first and foremost be a fear of God.
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:13.140]   It's not because I don't fear men.
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:15.940]   They say, "Oh, I'm thick-skinned,
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:17.460]   "so nothing you say bothers me."
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:18.540]   It bothers me.
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:23.300]   But if you're gonna represent God,
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:26.180]   the fear of God must grip you stronger
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:28.460]   than any other fear.
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:33.020]   That even if what I say drives all of you away,
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:36.300]   if it is the text, and if that's what the Bible says,
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:39.140]   that's what needs to be said.
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:41.620]   And even now, maybe some of you are uncomfortable.
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.980]   But the man who represent God,
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:49.980]   whether me or a pastor or an elder or a teacher,
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:54.900]   has to first and foremost be fears of God.
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:57.700]   What will God think if I say this?
[01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:00.060]   What will God think if I don't say this?
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:01.500]   What will God think if I do this?
[01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.740]   What will God think if I don't do this?
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:09.860]   The leaders of Israel were serving themselves.
[01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:13.020]   They were serving themselves.
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.860]   Then even the Savior of the world,
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:17.620]   standing in front of them,
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:19.020]   not only did they not receive him,
[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:20.700]   they ended up crucifying him.
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:23.540]   That's how far gone they were.
[01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:25.860]   Jesus says to the leaders in Matthew 23, 13,
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:28.260]   "Bewold to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,
[01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:30.100]   "because you shut off the kingdom of heaven
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:33.060]   "from people, for you do not enter in yourself,
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:36.140]   "nor do you allow those who are entering to go in."
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:39.940]   I mean, their whole position was to bring them to God,
[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:42.660]   and he says, "Not only are you not going to God,
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:45.100]   "you're preventing others from coming to God."
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.900]   That's where Israel was.
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:49.340]   The more they were engrossed in their system,
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:51.020]   the more lost they got.
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:53.260]   The more they were dedicated to the temple,
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.660]   the more rebellion that they experienced.
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:04:00.300]   So John the Baptist breaks in to call that out.
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:03.620]   We'll look at that next week.
[01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:04.740]   If you don't like today's message,
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:06.740]   you're gonna hate next week's.
[01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:09.700]   Today is all the circumstance of his presence,
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.020]   of his calling, of the timing.
[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:13.940]   Next week, he's gonna actually talk,
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:17.460]   and we'll see what's gonna come out of his mouth.
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:19.780]   In Matthew 20 through 15, he says,
[01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:21.740]   "Behold to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:24.180]   "because you travel around on sea and land
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:27.520]   "and make one proselyte, and when he becomes one,
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.180]   "you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves."
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:32.400]   See, they were active.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.500]   It wasn't that they were self-indulgent, did nothing.
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:38.020]   In fact, it would've been better if they did nothing,
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:41.260]   but they were very active at the temple.
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.540]   They were very active in teaching.
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:45.140]   They were very active in gathering proselytes,
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:48.980]   but every time they came,
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:52.580]   they became just like them and even worse.
[01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:55.100]   Finally, Matthew 20 through 25 says,
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:56.780]   "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:00.800]   "for you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish,
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:04.980]   "but inside they're full of robbery and self-indulgence."
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:08.320]   The danger of Bible study,
[01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:12.140]   the danger of learning the Bible,
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:13.980]   I can tell you, danger of seminary.
[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:16.620]   I don't know if you've ever heard it,
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:19.940]   but in seminary, there's a running joke,
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:21.260]   and we call it cemetery.
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:23.940]   We call it cemetery 'cause the people
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:25.220]   who are on fire for God come,
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:30.180]   and they get theology and Bible thrown at them,
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:31.920]   and they come out cold,
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:35.920]   like filled with theology, but their passion dies.
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:39.460]   Some people may look at that and say,
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:40.860]   "Then don't go to seminary."
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:44.900]   The Word of God did not do that to them.
[01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:48.180]   Exposure to the Word of God did not do that to them,
[01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:49.580]   so some of you guys may think,
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:51.300]   "Oh, then let's stop starting theology
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:53.220]   "so that we can stay on fire for God
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:55.140]   "and be ignorant forever."
[01:05:55.140 --> 01:06:00.260]   That's not the application of that.
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:01.500]   The problem is
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:07.040]   the Word of God is not bringing us to Him.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:11.800]   The Word of God is filling us with knowledge,
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:16.360]   and we use that to see what other people are doing wrong.
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.960]   Instead of a lamp unto our feet,
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:20.960]   we become a flashlight to point out
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:23.120]   what's going on wrong with other people.
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.480]   That's why it's turning that way.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:31.440]   I'm at the most danger of that.
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:34.040]   Where I study the Word of God,
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.780]   I'm in front of the Word of God every day.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.720]   Sometimes five, six, seven hours a day,
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.680]   I'm in my office and I'm at home
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:42.460]   just preparing sermons, Bible studies,
[01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:45.120]   and people that I'm meeting, and books that I'm reading,
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:48.400]   and as a result of that, I can spend all my time
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.920]   thinking about how I can present this to you
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:55.640]   and be very dense about what's going on in my own heart,
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.920]   in my own worship.
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:02.440]   There's a danger for anybody who's a teacher
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.640]   that all of these things just kind of creep in
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.400]   because we have a title.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:10.540]   Because we've been leaders for a while,
[01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:16.820]   we have a tendency to assume we're better off.
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:22.260]   I can tell you from my experience,
[01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:24.820]   the godliest people that I've met during my life
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:25.880]   were not pastors.
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:31.660]   They weren't leaders in the church.
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:34.500]   The godliest people that affected me,
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:37.520]   I said, wow, that guy really loves the Lord,
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.660]   were not pastors.
[01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:42.680]   They weren't leaders.
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:45.760]   They don't have any specific titles.
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.920]   They're just humble people who met the Lord
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:52.500]   and serving God in the background in humility.
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:55.400]   And they're doing things that they would have never done
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.560]   if they didn't meet the Lord.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:00.600]   Sometimes I go to churches and I give messages,
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.320]   and the whole church is attentive except the pastor.
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.420]   He's busy running around, setting things up,
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.380]   and he sets up chairs and he goes out.
[01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:14.860]   I'm in a position where I'm in the most danger of that.
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:19.580]   So all of us need your prayers
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:24.020]   that the word of God that we teach may convict us first,
[01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:27.140]   that we will be broken men first,
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:31.260]   that we will be sensitive to his teaching first,
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:35.620]   that we will be aware of the dead men's bones
[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:38.920]   that we've allowed to dwell in our hearts first.
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:43.200]   Because if we're not, we can be saying lofty things to you
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:45.180]   and leading you away from God,
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:49.260]   just like the leaders of Israel.
[01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:53.880]   And God may have to raise up somebody in the jungles,
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:59.300]   and far away from seminary, far away from these churches,
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:04.100]   so that somebody who has not been ruined by our system
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:07.200]   can have a pure relationship with God,
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:10.360]   and that man will speak for us at the end times.
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:14.760]   In Hebrews chapter 13, 11 through 14, it says,
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.760]   "For the bodies of those animals
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:19.300]   "whose blood is brought into the holy place
[01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:21.880]   "by the high priest as an offering for sin
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:24.740]   "are bound outside the camp.
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:27.240]   "Therefore, Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.860]   "through his own blood, suffered outside the gate.
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:32.920]   "So let us go out to him outside the camp,
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.540]   "bearing his reproach.
[01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:37.800]   "For here we do not have a lasting city,
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.740]   "but we are seeking the city which is to come."
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:42.540]   Jesus went outside the camp,
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:44.500]   John the Baptist went outside the camp.
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:48.340]   If God is speaking to you,
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:54.380]   examine your own life, examine your own calling,
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:55.780]   examine the way you study the Bible,
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:58.320]   examine the way you serve the church.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.180]   Is that about God, is that about you?
[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:04.460]   Are you coming to God because you set up this life
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:07.060]   and you need his sprinkling on that?
[01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:10.180]   Or have you really surrendered?
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:11.820]   Are you seeking after God?
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:15.460]   God, are you seeking after God?
[01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:18.560]   Are you seeking after Christ?
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:23.140]   Or are you trying to just come up this ladder
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.740]   in the religious system that's been created around us?
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:31.180]   The danger, and this is just personal,
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:36.900]   I believe in our generation,
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:39.740]   just following the pattern that has been set before us
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:42.260]   is going to lead to condemnation.
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:45.720]   Yeah, that's personal.
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.580]   Some of you may agree, may not agree.
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:52.780]   What is normal around us is just as blind
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:55.460]   as the nation of Israel was.
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:00.460]   If Jesus came now, like he did 2,000 years ago,
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:05.860]   how many of our pastors would be able to recognize him?
[01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:10.260]   How many of our church members would recognize him?
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:13.460]   If he was to raise up leaders in our generation,
[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:14.660]   where would he come from?
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:17.980]   Mega churches, from seminaries,
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:21.300]   people who wrote a lot of books, celebrity pastors?
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:26.520]   I pray that John's ministry, Jesus's ministry,
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:35.220]   would cause us to be sober enough
[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:39.060]   that we are not okay with status quo.
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:46.020]   Because status quo may be where Israelites were
[01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:50.100]   when Christ came, that we would not fall
[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:52.820]   under the same judgment, that we would come
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:55.580]   before the Lord and ask, Lord, search me and know me,
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:57.480]   see if there's any hurtful ways in me.
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:01.820]   Before I search the world, before I search our congregation,
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:03.300]   what's going on here?
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:05.980]   Have I compromised?
[01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:07.220]   Have I drifted?
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:12.220]   Have I allowed certain sins to percolate and excused
[01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:18.620]   for days, for months, for weeks, for years, for decades?
[01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:22.700]   Where I can also become so blind
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:25.740]   that when Jesus comes, I wouldn't recognize him.
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:34.300]   If this is fake, if this is fake,
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:37.580]   get as much out of it as you can.
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:38.800]   Make as many friends.
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:42.760]   Have VBS and have children, have great memories.
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:45.240]   Raise our children together.
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:48.300]   Go get a lot of money.
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:54.280]   Come to church, play football, softball, basketball.
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:59.300]   If this is fake, get as much out of it as you can.
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:06.300]   But if this is true, if this is true,
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:10.060]   all of that could be blinding us
[01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:14.180]   to where we really are in Christ.
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:20.180]   Come to Christ, Christ, not just a church,
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:21.660]   not just a Bible study.
[01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:23.760]   Come to Christ.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.480]   Let's take a few minutes to pray.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:35.720]   Again, as we welcome our pastor,
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:36.820]   priest to come up.
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:42.980]   We can easily become inoculated
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:46.060]   even from my own messages.
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:50.380]   We heard it enough where he just,
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:52.040]   Pastor Peter just going off again.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:57.580]   But let's not fall into this danger
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:03.000]   to think that the blindness of Israel
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.060]   is not gonna happen to us.
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:08.280]   It can happen to us.
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.940]   We come before the Lord and say,
[01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:14.460]   Lord, I wanna worship you in spirit and in truth.
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:15.660]   Open my eyes.
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:17.620]   Have I become blind myself?
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.180]   Am I actually walking with the Lord?
[01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:20.380]   Do I know this Christ?
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:21.780]   Do I love this Christ?
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:24.180]   Am I proclaiming this Christ?
[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:26.340]   And take some time to pray and search the Lord
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:27.500]   as our worship team leads us.
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:28.340]   Let's pray.

[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:45.820]   Lord God, it's in us first
[01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:49.020]   that you would search us and know us.
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:55.220]   Lord, if we've been blinded by our own passions,
[01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:58.420]   by our own need for security,
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:02.020]   by our own passions, Lord God,
[01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:05.420]   to have things, Lord, that you did not give us.
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:09.420]   If we have been blinded, Lord God,
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:11.620]   by the counsel of the wicked of this world,
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:16.220]   that we are now standing with sinners,
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:19.820]   maybe even sitting with the seat of mockers,
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:23.420]   Lord, teach us what it means to delight
[01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:24.620]   in the law of the Lord,
[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:28.620]   to truly meditate it on a day and night,
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:33.820]   that your word would convict us,
[01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:36.620]   your word would tear us down,
[01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:40.420]   it would break us, soften us,
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:44.620]   that we may be built up the way you desire,
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:48.420]   that we may be established for your kingdom,
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:52.220]   that we may grow for your glory.
[01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:56.820]   So for that end, we pray for revival in our hearts,
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:59.220]   revival in our church,
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:04.220]   revival in our families, revival in our generation.
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:10.020]   Help us, Lord God, not to live like the times of Noah,
[01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:13.820]   people eating and drinking, getting married,
[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:16.620]   as if we're gonna be here forever.
[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:19.620]   Help us to number our days,
[01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:23.420]   to know we are just a mist that comes and goes.
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:28.820]   And for that period, however long or short you have given us,
[01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:33.220]   that we may live, Lord God, investing for eternal things.
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:38.020]   So we pray, Father, that wherever you send us this week,
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:41.020]   that your word will resonate,
[01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:43.420]   that we would apply all that you've given.
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:45.620]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
