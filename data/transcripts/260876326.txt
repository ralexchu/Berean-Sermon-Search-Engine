[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340]   (footsteps)
[00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.240]   Gracious Father, we have come to seek you.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.160]   To know you in our prayers, to know you in our worship,
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.420]   in our time of fellowship.
[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.560]   What we are unable to do, no matter how hard we strive,
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.600]   we know, Father God, how desperate and dependent we are,
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.160]   Father, to come to you, to abide in you,
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.000]   to pray to you, cry out to you.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.360]   Lord, you know the needs of our hearts,
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.000]   you know the various things that we're wrestling with,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.720]   but we know, Father God, that ultimately,
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.440]   life and happiness is in you.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.200]   So we ask, Lord God, that you would call your believers
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.560]   to submit to you, to take this time, Lord God,
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.720]   to humble ourselves, to seek your face.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.040]   That as you hear us, and as you hear our prayers,
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.520]   that you would continue to soften and renew us, Lord God,
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.960]   that our affection for you may grow.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.640]   We pray for your guidance, we pray for your spirit,
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.180]   we pray, Lord God, for genuine fellowship.
[00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.240]   Bless us, Lord God, as we have come to meet you.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.680]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.080]   All right, and so, especially the chapter one,
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.480]   chapter one of the book of Psalms is the introduction,
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.080]   and so, many commentators will say
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.080]   that to understand the book of Psalms,
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.800]   you need to understand the chapter one,
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.360]   'cause chapter one is kinda like the main thesis,
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.040]   and everything else that you see in the rest of Psalms
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.360]   is kinda like the outworking of what he says in chapter one.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.720]   So we're gonna start and look at chapter one.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.560]   If you look at chapter one, it basically,
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.960]   in the summary, it says, "Blessed is the man
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.900]   "who walks not in the counsel of the wicked."
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.640]   The word blessed, in Hebrew, asherah,
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.040]   it literally means to be happy.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.760]   Happy is the man, you know?
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.160]   Again, for whatever the reason,
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.040]   some people think that happiness is found in the world,
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.520]   and then you come to church because this is your duty,
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.520]   this is, Christ did, you know, die for you,
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.600]   so you need to do this,
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.040]   but then when you really wanna be happy,
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.640]   you go outside, and it sometimes shows
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.360]   in the things that we pursue.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.920]   So when you come to church, it's duty,
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.680]   or if you wanna be happy, you go play sports,
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.600]   or you travel, or you do something else, right?
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.360]   But the beginning of the book of Psalms,
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.980]   the first prayer in the book of Psalms,
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.960]   it says, "Happy is the man," true happiness,
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.440]   and that's the distinction between a Christian
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.320]   and a non-Christian, is a non-Christian
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.880]   seeks happiness in the world.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.200]   A Christian has found his happiness,
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.720]   his joy, blessedness, in him.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.080]   And so when he begins the book of prayer,
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.400]   book of prayer, the book of Psalms,
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   it says, "Happy is the man."
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.000]   In fact, the word happy in the New Testament
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.800]   is often used interchangeably.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   Joy and salvation is used interchangeably.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.360]   So the first evidence of genuine salvation
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.440]   in a Christian is joy.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.800]   You know, a lot of times, we have a hard time
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.800]   seeing that in Christians who've been walking
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.280]   with the Lord for a long time, for whatever reason,
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.860]   but when you see somebody who just received the Lord,
[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.940]   almost always, the first thing that you can notice
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.400]   about them is joy.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.440]   There's this burden of sin that's been lifted off from them,
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.520]   and you see this light, because salvation literally means
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.280]   somebody who was dead has come to life.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.200]   Remember the word life is zoe in the New Testament.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.960]   The word zoe is to be alive.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.600]   So the idea of joy and happiness intertwined
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   with our understanding of salvation.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.520]   So when he says, "Blessed is the man, happy is the man,
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.440]   "saved is the man who does not walk
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.680]   "in the counsel of the wicked."
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.880]   So the first thing that he sees is,
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.160]   a Christian and a non-Christian,
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.560]   the distinction between them is where you find life.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.600]   If you find life in the world,
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.520]   and the church is just a place that you need
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.360]   to put in duty, you won't last long.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.280]   Anything that you dread to do,
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.620]   you're not gonna do it for long.
[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.480]   Only people who truly find life in Christ
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.760]   will persevere through it all,
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.520]   because this is where you come to find life.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.480]   He says, "Salvation is the man,"
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.260]   and then he gives three things that he does not do.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.880]   He does not walk in the counsel of the wicked.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.280]   Second, nor stand in the way of sinners.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.160]   Third, nor does he sit in the seat of scoffers.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.440]   So obviously when he says,
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.940]   the first identifying mark of a true Christian
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.520]   is he does not walk in the counsel of the wicked.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.680]   Now, instead of counsel of the wicked,
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.880]   how many people do you know that are wicked?
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.960]   There's some wicked people,
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.880]   and as long as you stay away from them, you'll be fine.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.880]   Wickedness in scripture is described
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.240]   as anyone who leads us away from God.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.120]   Any counsel, any idea, any thoughts, any principles
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.120]   that is contrary to true life in Christ is wicked counsel.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.980]   You can come in a form of angel of light,
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.200]   and yet that counsel leads us away from God
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.440]   is wicked counsel.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.480]   So he's talking about an individual
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.240]   who's living his life based upon the principles
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.600]   that everybody else lives on.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.880]   And it doesn't have to look evil, right?
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.040]   The counsel of the wicked doesn't say,
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.160]   go hit your children, you know, kick dogs.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.960]   The counsel of the wicked doesn't,
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.200]   you don't see it black and white.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.920]   Oftentimes the counsel of the wicked
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.920]   is distinguished between what is good and what is best.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.360]   Let me say that again.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.840]   Sometimes the counsel of the wicked
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.680]   is distinguished between what is good and what is best.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.200]   So the distinction between best and good is,
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.680]   there are things that we consider good, right?
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.960]   We wanna be good children, we wanna be good fathers,
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.400]   good mothers, we wanna be good parents,
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.640]   we wanna be good employees,
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.760]   we wanna be good citizens of the state.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.400]   And so all of these things are not evil,
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.600]   they're good things.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.880]   But sometimes these things lead us away from God.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.000]   Wickedness isn't always identified with black and white.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.560]   It's any counsel, any principle, any thought,
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.640]   any advice that leads us away from Christ the center
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.900]   is considered wicked counsel.
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.560]   Someone who is living constantly
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.040]   by the principles of this world.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.440]   If you work hard, you get money, you get a good job,
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.840]   you live a nice life,
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.800]   and then you don't get to go to hell,
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.000]   you get to go to heaven.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.300]   So what's wrong with that, right?
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.560]   Why can't we have it all?
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.160]   Because the scripture says,
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.580]   love for the world is envy toward God.
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.360]   So the first thing that he says,
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.760]   the aspect of true salvation is an individual
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.800]   who does not walk according to the pattern of this world,
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.640]   according to the counsel of this world.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.040]   And then the second thing is he said,
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.860]   he doesn't stand in the way of sinners.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.260]   So you see the progression.
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.600]   An individual who's constantly making decisions
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.080]   based upon the principles of this world,
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.960]   eventually he's gonna be counted among the sinners.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.200]   Sin is never dormant.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.280]   If you allow compromise in your life
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.240]   and you begin to walk in the counsel of the wicked,
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.320]   it doesn't stay dormant.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.360]   It almost always grows.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.700]   A sin that you've allowed and you've compromised in,
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.680]   and you just kind of excuse and justify,
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.360]   eventually will grow to become something bigger
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.320]   than you originally intended.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.080]   And so you look at it as when it comes
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.200]   to the core decisions of his life,
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.960]   his pattern of the way he makes decisions
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.640]   is no different than a non-Christian friend,
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.540]   other than the fact that he goes to church on Sunday.
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.640]   Eventually he will be counted among the sinners.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.280]   His value system is no different than a non-Christian.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.140]   So eventually you're not gonna be able to distinguish
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.200]   between an unrepentant sinner
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.900]   and somebody who professes to have repented.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.120]   And that's the second progression.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.280]   Third progression, he says,
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.400]   nor sits in the seat of scoffer.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.320]   Do you see the progression?
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.760]   First part of it is his counsel,
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.220]   his thought process is no different than the world.
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.320]   Second, then he begins to be identified.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.160]   You can't distinguish him between a Christian
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.080]   and a non-Christian.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.400]   And then third, he becomes a scoffer.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:20.720]   If you've talked to anybody who used to go to church,
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.000]   or used to be at church,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.680]   or used to be very active at church,
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.640]   and you sit there and talk with them,
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.120]   the people who are the most antagonistic
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.280]   toward Christ and the church
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.200]   are usually people at one point.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.640]   At one point, used to be at church.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.600]   They, oh, I used to be a professing Christian.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.840]   I used to be just like you.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.320]   Usually the people who are the most antagonist
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.840]   toward the church are people,
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.640]   or not people who've never been to church.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.440]   It's usually people who at one point
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.600]   used to go to church and they fell out.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.040]   And you see this progression.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.160]   Let me give you a pattern that I've observed
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.480]   through the years, what happens to somebody
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.400]   who compromised in their sin,
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.720]   and the usual progression of how that sin
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.160]   has its effect in their life.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.480]   They compromise into sin,
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.000]   and usually it's not black and white.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.160]   Usually it's not, do I choose God or do I choose Satan?
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.000]   It's not like that.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.040]   It's usually you make a compromise
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.280]   where you want God and you want something else,
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.640]   and you know in your heart it's a compromise.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.160]   Or it may be a blatant sin.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.520]   Whatever it is, it is unconfessed,
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.280]   or it's very superficially repentant.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.680]   And so what happens is that guilt
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.520]   upon that person begins to weigh heavy.
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.320]   And that guilt begins to fester,
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.360]   and then as a result of that guilt,
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.920]   they feel distant from God.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.320]   The Psalms don't have any kind of effect on you.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.480]   You read the Bible, it just seems like words, right?
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.400]   And you're just kind of checking in and checking out
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.900]   because you feel distant from God.
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.800]   So when you begin to feel distant from God,
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.200]   you begin to feel distant from others.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.960]   And you get together and you're talking,
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.120]   you say, "Well, you know, I'm in this large group of people,
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.700]   "but I really don't feel like I'm fellowshipping."
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.440]   As a result of distance from God,
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.800]   you feel this disconnect with other believers.
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.920]   And then what ends up happening,
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.600]   again, this is the progression.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.680]   When somebody's not right with God,
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.320]   and they feel distant in fellowship,
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.360]   the next stage is they begin to say,
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.620]   "Well, you know, every time I go to church,
[00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:28.240]   "I feel judged because I don't connect with people.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.580]   "Maybe they're the problem.
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.160]   "Maybe if they were more gracious."
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.760]   And so because of this frustration,
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.840]   this guilt upon them that is unrepentant,
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.440]   distance from God, distance from people,
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.280]   and then eventually you say,
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.640]   "These people are judging me."
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.880]   And then that progresses to,
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.920]   "These people are a bunch of hypocrites
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.480]   "'cause they're no better than I am."
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.680]   And then as a result of that,
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.520]   these people are hypocrites,
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.320]   and the next stage is, "I hate the church."
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.660]   You know, church is filled with hypocrites,
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.360]   and all they do is judge people.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.220]   And then the end result of all of that is,
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.820]   "I don't know if I believe God,
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.420]   "if that's the way the church is."
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.180]   This is a progression that I've seen throughout the years,
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.960]   not just one person,
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.780]   but it almost always begin with unconfessed,
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.900]   unrepentant sin, or sin that they've allowed and compromised.
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.860]   And so they allow their life to be saturated
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:20.980]   with the counsel that we're given,
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.500]   and they begin to get counted with the sinners,
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.100]   and eventually they are sitting with a sea of scoffers,
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.600]   not realizing the genesis of all of that
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.980]   is a sin that they allowed it to fester in their hearts.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.900]   He says, "Blessed is the man,
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.960]   "saved is the man,
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.300]   "happy is the man whose pattern of life is not that."
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.180]   But then he says,
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.400]   "But his delight is in the law of the Lord,
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.540]   "and on this law he meditates day and night."
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.700]   His delight is in the law of the Lord.
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.220]   Now, we are in the new covenant, in the New Testament,
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.480]   so whenever we hear the word law,
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.780]   we think it's a bad word, right?
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:05.500]   The law, we're not about the law, we're about grace.
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.340]   Law is satanic, grace is from Jesus.
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:12.020]   We have this misunderstanding about the law,
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.340]   thinking that the law, somehow,
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:15.540]   like in the new covenant,
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.300]   is a dirty word that you can't say.
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.260]   Remember, Paul himself corrects that.
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.940]   He says, "No, the law is not bad,
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.340]   "law is good if you use it," what?
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:30.140]   "Legally, profitably, for what it was intended for."
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.780]   How do we understand when he says,
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:36.460]   "If true joy is coming from delighting in the law of the Lord,"
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.540]   you know, some of us will, or a lot of us will sit here
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.380]   and say, "Well, I'm in trouble,
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.460]   "because I don't know if I delight in it.
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.820]   "I'll study it, I'll apply it,
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.880]   "I don't know if I delight in it."
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.740]   You have to understand,
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:50.980]   remember Paul says in Romans chapter seven,
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.920]   "For I delight in the law of the Lord,
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.740]   "but there's another law working within me."
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.180]   Whether you believe that pre-Christian or post-Christian,
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.580]   basically what Paul says, "In my flesh,
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.660]   "I don't have any ability to carry this out."
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.900]   And that's why he said, "Because of the Holy Spirit,"
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.780]   right, he walks in the spirit, has life,
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.760]   he walks in the flesh, is death.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.140]   In and of itself, in our own flesh,
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.540]   we don't have the ability to delight in the law.
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.380]   But Paul says in Galatians 3, 24,
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.720]   "So then the law was our guardian until Christ came,
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.720]   "in order that we might be justified by faith."
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.560]   When he says he delights in the law of the Lord,
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.420]   he's not saying that, you know,
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.140]   if you really wanna be saved,
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.580]   you have to enjoy keeping the Sabbath.
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:39.980]   He's not saying that if you wanna really be happy,
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:44.300]   you have to really enjoy making sacrifices,
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.820]   and waking up early, and giving to the poor.
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.220]   You have to enjoy that or else you're not saved.
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.180]   The reason why he says he delights in the law of the Lord
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.940]   because the law of the Lord is basically
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.380]   an extension of who God is,
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.300]   is another way of saying he delights in God.
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.300]   And because he delights in God,
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.580]   he delights in the law of God.
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.340]   Because those are his words, those are his commandments.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:14.380]   Because he loves the Lord, he delights in the law.
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.860]   And then he says, "And on his law,
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.180]   "he meditates day and night."
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.060]   Now, let me make this very clear.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:26.920]   You know, the order of this is extremely important.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.380]   You don't love the Lord because you meditate
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.620]   on the law day and night.
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.340]   It's because you love the Lord,
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.340]   you will meditate on him day and night.
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.380]   It's very difficult for you to meditate
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.380]   on something that you do not delight in.
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:44.300]   Correct?
[00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:49.020]   So many of us are trying so hard to delight in his law,
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.380]   memorize and meditate on it, but you don't delight in it.
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.340]   There's no delight in it.
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.620]   It's something that you just have to do.
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:59.580]   And then think about certain things that you really love.
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.100]   You can't help meditating on it.
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.740]   Some of you guys may remember the very first date
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.820]   that you had, right?
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.660]   Did somebody tell you?
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.020]   Think about your date.
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.460]   Think about what you're gonna do on that date.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.580]   Think about what you're gonna wear,
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.140]   where are you gonna eat, what car are you gonna drive,
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.260]   how early are you gonna pick up?
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.860]   Did somebody have to spell out for you
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.100]   to really put some thought into that?
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.340]   Maybe some of you, right?
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.180]   Maybe some of you.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:32.180]   But the natural response, when you are delighting
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.100]   in something, you just can't get this out of your mind.
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.060]   It's in your heart, it's in your thoughts,
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.420]   every part of it.
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.380]   Now, you may not be a detail-oriented person,
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:41.940]   but if it's something that you delighted,
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.060]   you end up putting a lot of attention on it.
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.020]   Some of you guys like cars.
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.460]   You know more about cars than an average person
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.140]   because you're delighted, it makes you happy.
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.540]   Some of you guys hate cars.
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:55.540]   And if somebody told you, you need to memorize
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:59.220]   all the different cars and the miles per gallon
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.380]   that you get and the tire size and all that,
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.020]   it's just, I mean, it's just torture for some of you.
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.780]   But some of you, you can't help but thinking about it, right?
[00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.260]   It could be you're idle because you love
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.540]   delighting in too much.
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:15.460]   When he says, happy is the man, safe is the man,
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.140]   who delights in the law of the Lord,
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.140]   it's honest law, he meditates day and night,
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.740]   he's describing an individual who met the Lord.
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.340]   He's describing an individual who's seen
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.660]   the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.740]   and as a result of that, that's on his mind,
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.660]   that's on his heart 24/7.
[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.580]   So he's not forcing himself to delight.
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:39.300]   He just delights in it, he can't stop thinking about it.
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.980]   We're not talking about a silly joy
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.260]   that puts a smile on your face
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.660]   every time you think about Jesus, maybe.
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.660]   But we're talking about someone
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.100]   who finds true life in Christ.
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.700]   The evidence of genuine salvation
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.900]   is that you'd rather be with Christ
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.180]   than anything else that this world offers.
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.940]   And that's why you come to church.
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.520]   That's why you wrestle in prayer.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.700]   That's why you study the word of God.
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.940]   And that's why you share your faith with other people.
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.420]   You tend to share the things that you delight in.
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.540]   If you don't delight in Christ,
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.740]   to share the gospel with people is torture.
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.300]   You say, "Well, that's not my personality."
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.280]   If you delight in something,
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.140]   I don't care if you're an extrovert or an introvert,
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.380]   you'll share it.
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.540]   You'll share it as an introvert,
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:30.980]   in the way that you uniquely do,
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.300]   you'll write letters, right?
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.460]   (congregation laughing)
[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.880]   Maybe you won't tell 'em in person.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.300]   You'll drop hints, and you have all kinds of ways
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.780]   as introverts to tell people.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.940]   If you delight, if that's something you really delight in,
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.620]   you watch a movie that you just really loved,
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.580]   it's on your Instagram.
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.900]   I don't only see extroverts doing that.
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.460]   It's on your Instagram, it's on your Facebook.
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.820]   Every time you get around,
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.860]   you're seeing if other people saw it,
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.260]   and you're like an evangelist.
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.940]   Watch this movie.
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.340]   You watch it, you gotta watch it.
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:05.740]   You're missing out on life.
[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:07.980]   If you don't watch it, you gotta watch it.
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.340]   Oh, you don't wanna watch it?
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:10.180]   You're missing out.
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:12.580]   I'll go with you, I'll buy you a cup.
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:13.700]   I'll watch it with you.
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.420]   So you become an evangelist
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.740]   in something that you delight in, right?
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.740]   But if there's no delight in your heart,
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.500]   evangelism is difficult.
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.660]   Talking to somebody that is a stranger to you,
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.180]   prayer becomes very difficult.
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.020]   Studying the word of God,
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.180]   something that you feel distant from,
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.540]   it's just studying, you know?
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.900]   You can't wait to get out of school
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.420]   because you're finished with studying,
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.260]   and then you get out,
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.100]   and then you come to church and say,
[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.500]   "You gotta study."
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.820]   'Cause that's all it will feel like
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.460]   if there is no real delight.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.100]   So he's not simply saying,
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.420]   "Here's what you do in order to be saved."
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:55.900]   He's describing somebody that has happened to him.
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:56.980]   And it doesn't matter whether you're
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:58.820]   an Old Testament believer or New Testament believer.
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.100]   It was the same, remember?
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.460]   He said Old Testament believers were saved by faith.
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.220]   They did, and they lived their life in obedience
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.540]   because they had faith in God.
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:08.500]   It wasn't their obedience that saved them.
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:12.300]   It was their faith that led to obedience.
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.220]   And it's no different in the Old Testament and New Testament.
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.300]   They delighted in the law of the Lord,
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.820]   and it was not that that was their way of salvation.
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.300]   It was because they believed in God,
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.380]   they wanted to obey God.
[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.260]   That's not what saved them,
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.060]   but that's why they delighted in it.
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:31.340]   An individual who has met Christ,
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.660]   and his delight is in the law of the Lord,
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.700]   and as a result of that,
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.260]   that's what's saturating your mind,
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.540]   and your heart, and your thought,
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.620]   and your speech, and your desire.
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.140]   He says, "He's like a tree planted by a stream of water
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.540]   "that yields its fruit in its season,
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.060]   "and its leaf does not wither.
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.260]   "In all that he does, he prospers."
[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.940]   It is no different than what Jesus said in John 15, 5,
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.220]   "I am the vine, you are the branches.
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.180]   "Whoever abides in me, and I in him,
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.700]   "heed is that there is much fruit,
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.380]   "for apart from me, you can do nothing."
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:06.180]   How frustrating is it when we are not abiding in him,
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.860]   and trying so hard to bear fruit?
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.460]   He says, "You can't bear fruit,
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.120]   "if you're not delighting in him.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.220]   "If your thoughts and mind is not abiding in him,
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:22.020]   "and you're not meditating on him, you can't bear fruit."
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.140]   He says, he doesn't say,
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.340]   "It's gonna be very difficult to bear fruit."
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.940]   He says, "No, it is impossible to bear fruit,
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.420]   "if you're not abiding in him."
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.100]   What he's saying here in John chapter 15, 5
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.900]   is no different than what he's saying in Psalm chapter 1.
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:41.700]   So the first step of salvation is to meet Christ.
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:47.860]   What can cause you, what can cause you and I
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.700]   to take our eyes off of this world?
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:57.940]   This world is developed and built
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.940]   on tempting us away from God.
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.540]   Billions of dollars are spent to convince you
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.500]   that you need the phone, that you need the car,
[00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.820]   that you need to go to this specific place in the world.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.460]   Billions of dollars.
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.700]   Satan, the God of this age,
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.500]   is constantly wrapping his mind around
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.020]   making this world as attractive as possible
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.580]   for you to come to the world.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.140]   How can you possibly, by your own willpower,
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.340]   say no to that?
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:31.780]   You can't.
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:35.260]   So it's only natural that somebody in his flesh
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.420]   will be attracted to the world.
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.700]   What power exists in the universe
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.660]   that would cause us to pull us away from that?
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:49.300]   Christ and Christ alone.
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.620]   Christ alone.
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.700]   Christians do not have that power.
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:59.140]   Christians, they don't have the fellowship of believers,
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:03.100]   you know, peoples, friendships, they come, they go.
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.300]   Leaders, no matter how much you respect them,
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.100]   they're human beings.
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.100]   They're sinful people who are standing in between
[00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.800]   and the best that we can do is to point you to Christ.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.620]   No promises of man, no organization,
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.380]   nothing can win you over from the world
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.860]   than Christ himself.
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.420]   So if our gaze is not upon Christ,
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.700]   if the very thing that attracted to him from the beginning,
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.420]   where our eyes were open and we saw the glory
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.660]   of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.580]   and it's because of that we said,
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.900]   "I want him rather than the world."
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.540]   That's what attracted us to him.
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:47.340]   But he says, if after you've been justified,
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:51.220]   you take your eyes off of Christ
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.180]   and you try to be sanctified and bear fruit
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.420]   by your own willpower, by your own organization,
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:56.860]   by your own intellect,
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.460]   no wonder we're frustrated.
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.660]   That's why he says, "Then fix your eyes upon Jesus,
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.380]   "the author and the perfecter of our faith."
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:09.980]   So the only power that exists that causes us
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:13.340]   to be able to overcome the temptation of the world
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.820]   is Christ and Christ alone.
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:20.660]   So the invitation for us is,
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.340]   if that's the case, we come to him,
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.060]   he's like a tree planted by the streams of water,
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.180]   planted by the streams of water,
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.860]   which yields its fruit in season,
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:30.820]   its leaf does not wither,
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:34.420]   and whatever he does, he prospers.
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.740]   So many of us have seen Christ,
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:38.940]   we've been attracted to him,
[00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.140]   and so we made the decision,
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:45.660]   and then somehow we've kind of moved past the water
[00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.420]   and we've planted ourselves somewhere out in the desert.
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:53.420]   And so we're getting bits and pieces of taste, right?
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.780]   And so every once in a while,
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.340]   when people don't bring the water to you,
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.700]   the responsibility of the leaders in your life
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.180]   are like, "We have to fill the bucket,"
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.820]   or, "We have to run to you, give you some water
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.260]   "every time you look like you're gonna die."
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.860]   And that's how you're surviving.
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.300]   Somebody needs to come running over to you
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.940]   every time you dry up and pour water,
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.540]   and say, "He's okay now for another six months.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.380]   "We'll leave him alone,
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:17.460]   "and we have a bunch of other people
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.820]   "who are withering and dying in the desert,
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:19.740]   "so we gotta get buckets."
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.800]   So the leaders are running around with buckets of water,
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.500]   looking for people out in the desert to pour water in.
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.980]   And that's how you're surviving.
[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:32.260]   Day to day, week to week, month to month,
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.140]   as soon as somebody doesn't run to you with water,
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.500]   you shrivel up and die.
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:40.580]   So he says, "But a man who truly delights,
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.140]   "who's truly happy, who's living, who's alive,
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.480]   "is a man not planted in the desert,
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.300]   "but the one who was planted by streams of water."
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.260]   And he says, "Does not wither
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.800]   "because the source of life, the living water,
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.700]   "is in him constantly."
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.740]   He can survive whether it rains or doesn't rain.
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.880]   Because the source that gives him life
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.660]   is underneath him constantly flowing.
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:11.500]   See, that's what sanctification ultimately is.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.380]   It's not about, "Am I waking up in time?
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.100]   "Do I get a memorizing of scripture?
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.600]   "Am I doing this?
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.500]   "Am I living a certain pattern?"
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.740]   All of these things are byproducts.
[00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:25.460]   But the main goal of sanctification
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.180]   is to make sure that I'm planted by the living water.
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.940]   If I'm planted by the living water,
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.460]   tell somebody who loves the Lord,
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.660]   tell them to don't talk about Jesus.
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.860]   I mean, go to the Middle East,
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.980]   go to certain countries where persecution is happening,
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.900]   threatening them with jail, physical violence,
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:50.100]   and you tell them, you tell those people
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.460]   who have tasted the living water,
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.020]   whose this living water is flowing underneath them,
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:57.780]   you tell them, "If you do this, there's consequences."
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.500]   You know exactly what happens.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.020]   You can't stop these people.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.260]   Tell somebody who is in love with Christ
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:06.060]   to stop talking about Christ.
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.180]   They do more.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.760]   They do more.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.940]   You know why they do it?
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.140]   It's not because they're more courageous than us.
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:17.340]   It's not because they're made of something different than us.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:23.300]   It's because it brings them joy to do so.
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.720]   They're willing to risk their health,
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.780]   whatever it is that they have,
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.420]   because what they see in Christ
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.380]   is much better than anything in this world,
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.220]   even if they have to give their life.
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.340]   It's not something that they did.
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.260]   It's not because they were discipled properly.
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.780]   It's not because they had all the right formulas
[00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:41.700]   in their life.
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.980]   It's just this living water is underneath this current.
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.260]   And again, the struggle that you and I have
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.780]   in this part of the world
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:53.520]   is that we have so much distraction.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.340]   And the biggest problem that you and I have
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.060]   is constantly being distracted
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.020]   and not gazing upon Christ.
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:08.020]   This is why our time of devotion in the Lord,
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.500]   and why prayer, again, you can do devotion.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.340]   You can have prayer that in and of itself
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.620]   doesn't make you strong,
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.980]   because there's only an avenue to get us to Christ.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.980]   So today, what I want to encourage us to do
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.540]   is take some time to really pray
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.140]   and examine our life to see where are you planted?
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:29.780]   What is the source of your joy?
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:33.580]   Do you delight in the Lord?
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:37.340]   Take some time to think about that.
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.160]   Where is your life?
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.860]   Does it come from people?
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.140]   Does it come from circumstances?
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.700]   Does it come from hope for a superficial future?
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.060]   What is killing your joy?
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.700]   What is quenching the spirit?
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.260]   Are you abiding in Christ?
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.900]   Is this word abiding in you?
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:56.380]   Are your friendships truly centered in Christ?
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.500]   Are you spurring them on?
[00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:58.580]   Are they spurring you on?
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.620]   So there's four things that I want you to focus on.
[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.380]   If you can put that in there.
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.420]   Okay.
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.540]   I hope you can see it.
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.620]   First one is the word.
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:11.100]   I'm gonna take some time to pray,
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.220]   pray for greater affection for Christ
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:16.540]   that will lead us to greater meditation on God's word.
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.460]   Pray for a more consistent time of devotion
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:19.980]   and meditation through God's word.
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.460]   So very first thing,
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.980]   if that's not a regular pattern in your life,
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.780]   to constantly plant yourself by the living water,
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.420]   that's the first thing that I really wanna encourage you to do
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:30.900]   to not to sit back and say,
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.620]   man, you know, like I wish I could just be planted
[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.540]   by doing nothing, right?
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:41.060]   Those of you who are not regularly in the word of God,
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.700]   your spiritual, the fix to your spiritual problem
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:48.660]   may be as simple as just regularly coming to the Lord.
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.660]   You say, well, I mean, you know, that's it?
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.340]   It may not be like completely the fix,
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.660]   but from my experience,
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.500]   if you are regularly living a pattern of life
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.820]   where you're not regularly intaking the word of God,
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:03.820]   and I'm not talking about Sundays,
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:04.660]   I'm not talking about Wednesday,
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:05.780]   I'm not talking about small group,
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.380]   I'm talking about you personally.
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.740]   So I'm not gonna guarantee anything
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.140]   'cause I'm not God,
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.100]   but I can almost guarantee you, okay,
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.100]   just from experience,
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.980]   if you're not regularly in the word of God on your own,
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.180]   in devotions and in prayer, being the Lord,
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:25.060]   so much of your spiritual frustration
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.780]   will be fixed by just doing that.
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.500]   So if you're not in the pattern of doing that,
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.900]   don't think about, oh, fellowship,
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.100]   I need leadership, I need accountability.
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.340]   All that stuff is superficial.
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.700]   Like if you don't do that first,
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.900]   if you don't come to the Lord first,
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.540]   then your relationship with God
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.700]   is a corporate relationship.
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.460]   You know him only in group,
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:47.100]   but you don't know him personally, right?
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.900]   So the first thing I wanna encourage you to do
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.940]   is how are you interacting with God in his word?
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.660]   Second, obviously in prayer.
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.660]   Is your prayer consistent and persistent?
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.980]   Again, communication, right?
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:01.860]   So those of you who've ever sat with me
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:02.780]   for marriage counseling,
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.380]   that's the first thing we talk about,
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.220]   is communication,
[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:06.700]   because without communication,
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:10.380]   you can spend 24 hours together,
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.420]   and at the end of the day,
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.020]   you feel like, well, I don't know her,
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.380]   she doesn't know me, right?
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.740]   So God communicates through his word,
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.740]   we communicate through prayer.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:20.780]   So those two things,
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.860]   so those two things are not a regular pattern in our life.
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:24.700]   Those are the first things
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.820]   that we need to give our attention to.
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.540]   Third, fellowship.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.380]   Pray to be more deliberate with the friendship
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.380]   that you already have in church.
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.060]   I know some of you guys say,
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.020]   well, it's so hard to fellowship with people, you know?
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.340]   A lot of times it's because you set a pattern
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.420]   in your friendship that you can talk about Jesus
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.060]   with strangers, but for whatever the reason,
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.940]   you can't do it with your friends.
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.940]   To be deliberate about breaking that pattern.
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:51.060]   So if you have a group of friends
[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.540]   where it's very awkward to talk about Christ,
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.540]   be deliberate about breaking that habit.
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:00.060]   Ask them, even if it's weird, right?
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.180]   If you have a group of friends
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:03.220]   that that's just not your normal pattern,
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.340]   you can go to Disneyland, spend all day long
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:07.380]   and goof around, but when you say Jesus,
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:10.020]   it's just everybody just like, you're weird, right?
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:14.780]   If that's the case and they're Christians with you,
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.340]   that's something that I really wanna encourage you
[00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:21.300]   to be deliberate about changing them, right?
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.820]   Take small steps, just ask them,
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:24.380]   like how's your Friday time, how you doing spiritually?
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.260]   Get in the habit of asking
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.380]   and really connecting on a spiritual level.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.220]   Secondly, pray to connect with new friends at church
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.700]   to share Christ with on a regular basis.
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:39.220]   If you happen to be with a bunch of friends
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.620]   and you're making efforts
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:44.100]   and they just have no interest at all,
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.580]   my experience, again, I don't know everybody in this church,
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.500]   but my experience is majority of the people in this church
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.660]   will appreciate it if you took the initiative,
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.180]   majority of people.
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:56.140]   There might be one or two, right?
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.820]   One or two, but I don't know who they are,
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:58.980]   but I'm just, you know.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.900]   There might be one or two who rejects you,
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:06.140]   but my experience has been that that is not the case, right?
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:09.220]   But if you, for whatever the reason,
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.100]   have a difficult time doing that,
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.900]   there's a lot of people in this church
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.300]   that wants to run this race with you, right?
[00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.540]   Be active, look for true fellowship,
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.460]   not just people who you're gonna hang out with,
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:22.900]   not just some people who you're going
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.740]   to celebrate birthdays with and take trips with,
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.700]   but people who you're really gonna partner with, right?
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.300]   So initially, look at the people
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.940]   who you are already connected to,
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.220]   and then secondly, look outside of that,
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.620]   and there's so many new people,
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.900]   so many other people that you probably don't know.
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.060]   I don't know everybody at church,
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.820]   so I'm almost 100% certain, not 100%,
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.540]   100% certain that you don't know everybody either.
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.180]   And there's a lot of people who are hungry for God
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.780]   that would be more than willing to sit down
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.100]   with this chair and pray with you.
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:53.580]   So second, pray for that, pray for true fellowship.
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.420]   And thirdly, evangelism.
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.540]   Pray for greater sensitivity to the people
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.460]   you are in contact with regularly
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.500]   to be a witness for Christ.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.740]   So when we think about evangelism,
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.260]   we think of going out on the streets or UCI,
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.500]   or we're gonna go to China or India.
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.980]   The first place that you really need to look at
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:14.860]   are the people that you already know
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:16.340]   and be intentional with those people.
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.740]   It may be your coworkers, it may be your school friends,
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:21.220]   it may be your family members, right?
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:22.580]   How can I be intentional with that?
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.500]   It doesn't mean that you need to have a gospel track
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.860]   right in your pocket and just lay it on them, right?
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.780]   It may not be an effective way to evangelize,
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.020]   but just be intentional.
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:35.900]   Easter's coming up, right?
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.900]   Christmas, just any American holiday
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.780]   is an opportunity to talk about Christ.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:43.420]   You just have to talk about the holiday, right?
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:45.020]   And it leads to the gospel.
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.940]   They ask you, what's your hobby?
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:48.580]   Don't say, oh, I like going to Zizia, man.
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:52.220]   That may be true, but that's an opportunity.
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.460]   I spend a lot of time at church, which is also true, right?
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.940]   It's an opportunity to share the gospel, be intentional.
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:01.020]   So if your mind is not on the things of God
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.580]   and you're not meditating on that,
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:03.900]   you have to force yourself
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.660]   and then you're gonna miss opportunities.
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.580]   But when you're sober, right?
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:09.980]   When you're in the Word and in the prayer and you're sober,
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:13.180]   you will be surprised just how many opportunities
[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:15.180]   already exist in your life.
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:17.540]   And all you have to do is take advantage of it.
[00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:21.060]   So pray that God will open your eyes
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.980]   to be sensitive to the people who are already around you.
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.140]   Secondly, pray for opportunity
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:26.220]   to share the gospel with people you know
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:29.700]   or people you may come into contact with, right?
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:32.700]   Again, not just the people who you're already in contact with,
[00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:34.300]   maybe there's opportunity that you can have.
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.780]   So again, for those of you who are students,
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:40.540]   if you're at school and you have a school project,
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:42.460]   that's a perfect opportunity.
[00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:45.940]   Get together with other people.
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:49.260]   I remember when I was in college,
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.540]   you know, I had such a passion for evangelism
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.100]   and I thought, "What can I do?"
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:56.660]   So I used to go on the street and evangelize
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:59.900]   and I had an idea that Fullerton College
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.860]   had a public speaking class.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.980]   And I said, "If I take that class,
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.900]   "they give me three opportunities to preach."
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.180]   Well, not preach, but public speaking.
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:10.940]   To me, it was preaching.
[00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:11.940]   You know, so I got in there.
[00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.900]   I took that whole class for the purpose
[00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.820]   of sharing the gospel, right?
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.140]   And the whole class, I would say,
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.780]   "Man, you know, I would have to go
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:24.100]   "and talk to strangers, but the teacher
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.780]   "is giving me about seven minutes
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.180]   "with a captivated audience
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:32.740]   "and I preach the gospel three times to these people."
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:37.740]   So all I'm asking is to be sober, to be intentional.
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.740]   There's all kinds of, especially if you're a student,
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:41.740]   if you're coworkers, there's all kinds of stuff.
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:44.820]   If they ask you, "Well, how can you," don't say no, right?
[00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:48.300]   You can't share the gospel with people
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.060]   that you refuse to be friends with.
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.900]   Become their friends, right?
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:54.620]   You don't have, you're in the world,
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.180]   you're not of the world.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.460]   So become friends with them, hang out with them.
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.300]   Don't just hang out in your Christian bubble
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:02.260]   and then when it's time to evangelize,
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.500]   you have nobody to evangelize with
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.740]   'cause you don't know any non-Christians.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.780]   Get in the habit of integrating, right?
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.860]   Whether you're a student or you're a worker, right?
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.580]   So pray for those opportunities.
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.900]   And then pray specifically as we have
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.580]   the Easter coming up and every Easter,
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.860]   we try to remind you to be sober
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.820]   and we wanna do it early this year, right?
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:25.020]   We already have a lot of non-Christians coming to church
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.260]   and we're really excited because we see so many of you
[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:30.020]   inviting your coworkers and friends and family members
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:31.660]   who aren't Christians coming to church
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.740]   and so we're excited to see that you're actively doing that.
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:39.740]   But this Easter is a Sunday that a lot of non-Christians
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:42.340]   and nominal Christians who may not be true believers,
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:45.060]   may be confused about their faith, they're willing to come.
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.860]   So take advantage of that, right?
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.020]   Redeem this opportunity.
[00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.140]   So really pray specifically.
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.460]   If there's people in your life that you would like to invite
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.780]   even if they don't come, at least if you invite them,
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:57.580]   that may break the ice to be able to share the gospel
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:59.860]   with them in the future, okay?
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.620]   So what I would like you to do is take that piece of paper
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:07.340]   that we gave you and again, I want you to write down
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.300]   like point one, point two, point three, point four
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.940]   and write down as much as you can.
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.300]   And then after you do that,
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.900]   we're gonna take some time to pray, right?
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:17.140]   And again, the reason why I asked you to do that
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:19.060]   is because if you're not in the habit of,
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:22.140]   you can match the things that I'm asking you to pray for.
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.700]   And so once you've done that, again, just like last time,
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:25.860]   we're gonna take about 15 minutes
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:27.980]   and I'm gonna give you some time to pray.
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:31.300]   You can pray out loud, you can pray quietly, right?
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.380]   But just pray, persevere in prayer.
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:37.740]   Even if after three minutes, like man, this is hard, right?
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.420]   Again, these are muscles that you need
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.240]   to get in the habit of doing.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:43.180]   So sit there and persevere in prayer.
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:49.300]   So again, if you need a pen, go get it, it's in the back.
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:53.860]   Or if you don't and you have a phone,
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.020]   you wanna type it in your phone,
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.420]   just type it into your phone.
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.460]   And just write down as much as you can
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.380]   and I'm gonna give you about five, six minutes
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.620]   and after that, we're gonna take some time to pray
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:04.980]   and then the priest is gonna come up
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.860]   and lead us in a few worship songs.
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:09.420]   And then after that, Pastor Mark's gonna come
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.820]   and he's gonna lead us in corporal prayer, okay?
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.820]   Thank you.
