[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.320]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 11.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.080]   We'll be reading from verse 17 to 18, but the focus of the message this morning is going
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.040]   to be specifically on verse 19.
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:31.400]   Hebrews chapter 11 verse 17 through 19, reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.880]   By faith Abraham when he was tested offered up Isaac and he who had received the promises
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.920]   was offering up his only begotten son.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.320]   It was he to whom it was said in Isaac your descendants shall be called.
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.880]   He considered that God is able to raise people even from the dead from which he also received
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.080]   him back as a type.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.240]   Let's pray.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.160]   Heavenly Father we pray for your grace and may your word be anointed to go forth so that
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.280]   your children may hear the voice of your son and follow him and him alone.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.040]   Open our eyes Lord God that we may see a greater glimpse of your glory.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.600]   That what we give you Father each week each day may simply be a reasonable response.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.360]   So we ask for your anointing this time in Jesus name we pray.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.360]   Amen.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:31.080]   If I was to ask you what is the greatest thing that has happened or somebody has done
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.160]   for you or to you that reminds you of the greatest love that you've ever received outside
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.280]   of Christ?
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.400]   Take a minute to think about that.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.480]   What is the greatest love or expression of love that you've ever received in your life
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.160]   outside of Christ?
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.200]   I don't know exactly what you're thinking.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.560]   I think most of us will probably say that it has something to do with our parents.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.040]   And a lot of times we don't realize how much sacrifice our parents have put into us.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.880]   No matter how great or good, no matter what kind of complaints, even if you come from
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.720]   a broken family, as you get older you understand more and more just how much it takes to raise
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.160]   a child, how much sacrifice.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.040]   I remember my father before he passed away, years before, he wrote an autobiography in
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.080]   Korean and obviously not many people read it.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.680]   It was just meant for our family and then some of the students that he was teaching.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.360]   But my dad is a very typical Korean father.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.720]   I never Christianed his love but we never, I don't remember having that many deep conversations
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.720]   with him.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.000]   And especially because he was in ministry and I was going into ministry and there are
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.400]   some books that he gave me that I didn't really take that seriously because he was a Presbyterian,
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.200]   I was a charismatic Baptist, at least at that time.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.400]   And so I thought, "We're too different."
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.320]   And years later I picked up the book that he gave me and one of the books that he gave
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.000]   me was actually from John MacArthur.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.520]   And the name of the book is "Pagans in the Pews."
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.800]   And I never considered it and then I looked at it and said, "Wow, my dad was basically
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.800]   telling me to read it."
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.720]   And it was his way of preparing me for ministry, to get ready.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.440]   And I remember one of the advices that he gave me when I was young going into ministry,
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.080]   it says, "If they treat you like a servant, it's because you are.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.400]   Don't be shocked.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.840]   You're going into ministry to serve people, so sometimes they're going to treat you like
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.920]   one, but don't be shocked."
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.800]   And that was his preparation for me and it's probably one of the best advice that I've
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.200]   gotten as a pastor.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.480]   But I got to read my dad's autobiography several times and at some point, so one of my goals
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.280]   in life is to translate into that English so that the grandchildren and the great-grandchildren
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.920]   will be able to read that for themselves.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.640]   But there's a lot of things that I learned about my dad through that book because he
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.080]   wrote about when he was a kid and what it was like going through the Korean War and
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.640]   how he had to take care of the family and immigrating to the United States, what it
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.360]   was like to have each kid and how...
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.600]   And he mentions each one of us by name and what it was like and how he loved his second
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.320]   son.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.960]   So there's a lot of things that he wrote in there.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:26.000]   It's like, "Okay, I have greater appreciation for the things that my dad went through, my
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.720]   mom went through as a result of reading that book."
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.120]   There's a lot of things that we don't truly appreciate.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.520]   We accept, we understand it, but the depth of what somebody has sacrificed for us, sometimes
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.600]   it takes us a while for us to mature, for us to grow and be sanctified, to be able to
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.560]   look back at that and say, "Wow, that was done for me."
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.320]   Every parent goes through that when you're raising your kids and when it's hard to raise
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.720]   your kids and the deepest part of your anxiety is like, "Man, somebody did that for me,"
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.720]   and we begin to appreciate our parents more when we get older.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.080]   Well, the text that we're looking at in Hebrews 19, it says what happened with Abraham and
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.240]   Isaac was a type.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.440]   In 19 specifically it says, "He considered that God is able to raise people even from
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:19.940]   the dead, from which he also received back as a type."
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.960]   So this story between Abraham and you guys probably know that story about how God calls
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.240]   Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac at the very last minute, God tells him to stop and
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:36.240]   then Abraham says, "The Lord will provide," and saves Isaac at the last minute.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.720]   That whole story, it says it was a type.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.760]   Now whenever you see that and the Bible spells out that this is a type, it was meant for
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.600]   us to understand every intricate detail of that because God placed that in history for
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.920]   a purpose.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.160]   So that's why this morning, even though it's that one word and this one particular verse,
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.120]   we're going to spend this whole morning looking at Genesis chapter 22, 1 through 14.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.600]   What is it exactly was God doing?
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.360]   But even before we get that, understand what a type is.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.520]   When the Bible says that is a type of Christ, that is a type of the gospel, the word type
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.080]   in the New Testament, it comes from two Greek words.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.360]   In your Bible it'll say type, but sometimes it would be one word, sometimes it would be
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.360]   the other word.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.960]   There's two words that has been translated as type in the New Testament.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.760]   The first one is tupos, and tupos is where we get the word literally to type, and the
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.920]   word type literally means to strike.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.880]   The best way to understand that is the typewriter, right?
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.840]   How many of you have used a typewriter in your life?
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.960]   Okay, there's a little bit more in this room than the first room.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.600]   The first service, I think there was maybe about 10, right?
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.960]   I remember like type, the computers came in sometime when I was in college, and then I
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.960]   remember trying to transition to a computer when I was in seminary, and I hated the computer.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.080]   And because one, I wasn't familiar with it, and two, I remember spending two days writing
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.360]   a paper and had it plugged into the light switch, and I turned it off and I lost everything.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.600]   So I said, "I'm never doing this again," right?
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.640]   Maybe I've gotten over it.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.080]   But the typewriter, prior to that, when we were younger, we had to write all our papers
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.400]   out on typewriter, right?
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.040]   And typewriter basically means that there's a little arm, for those of you who've never
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.360]   seen a typewriter, all right?
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.880]   And there's little letters that are attached to these typewriters.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.160]   And so when you press the letter, an arm would come out and it would strike the paper.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.600]   And whatever it is you are spelling, right, if you're saying, if you're spelling love,
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.040]   L-O-V-E, it would be struck.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.720]   And that's why it is a strike writer, right?
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.880]   Whether it is print writing or paper writing, this is strike writer.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.520]   That's what it means to be a typewriter, right?
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:02.120]   So the literal understanding of the word type is to make a strike, make an impression.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:08.600]   So when the Bible says that the story of Isaac and saving him and replacing him somewhere
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:15.360]   in the future, that it is a type, it's saying that God struck in history to make an impression.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.120]   So that years later, when we look back at that, it said, "Oh, that's what God meant.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.240]   That's what He was doing.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.160]   That's what a type is."
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.440]   So we can say one of the clearest types in the Old Testament is the tabernacle.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.680]   Everything that happened at the tabernacle, Book of Leviticus, was a type pointing to
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.880]   the coming of Christ.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:41.320]   So if the word type means to make an impression, where was He trying to make that impression?
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.300]   In our own hearts, in our own mind.
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:49.240]   So that when we study the Old Testament, that we would have a deep impression of what Christ
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.840]   did on the cross.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.680]   And so that's what that word type means, tupas.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.960]   There's another word that is translated in the New Testament as type, and that word is
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.280]   parabole, where we get the word parable.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.480]   And that's the word that is used here in verse 19, parable.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.640]   Parable is like a type to make an impression, but instead of striking, it means to tell
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.880]   a story that it could refer to, make something else more clear.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.800]   So Jesus often spoke in parables.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.960]   And when He spoke in parables, He would take a spiritual truth, but He would illustrate
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.300]   it through some sort of a story.
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.520]   And so it's much easier to understand the story.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.640]   And so He would tell a short story to illustrate a spiritual principle.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.440]   And that's the word that is used here.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:43.880]   That whether it is to make an impression or to clarify something, God did everything that
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.980]   He did to prepare for the coming of Christ.
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.000]   That's why Jesus says that you guys search for scriptures thinking that if you did all
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.240]   of these things that there's life, He said, "All of it was really about me."
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.300]   All of it was to prepare you and to show you.
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:03.040]   Just like as I was reading my dad's book about what he did, what he went through, sacrifices
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:11.140]   that he made, looking back at the Old Testament, Old Testament is a story of our adoption.
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:16.560]   And I know we have several families in our church who have either adopted or we have
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.160]   Jason and Jen who just came back and adopted a child, and we have others who are waiting
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.620]   to go and pick up their child.
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.740]   The Old Testament really is a story about our adoption.
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.080]   Our adoption story of when did the story start?
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.520]   When did He think about us?
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.520]   What did He do?
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.840]   How did He prepare?
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.740]   What sacrifices did He make?
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:39.640]   So it wasn't just the time when you chose to pick that child up and brought him home,
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:45.960]   but all the preparation that went into fundraising maybe, saving money, making some sacrifices,
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.760]   preparing your home, getting the visa, all that they had to go through in order so that
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.200]   that child can come home.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.400]   And that's what a type is.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:11:00.580]   A type is a story of our adoption that has been implanted in the Old Testament to tell
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.120]   us about what He did for us.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:10.360]   So as we study this, as we take a look at it, and again, what he's referring to in verse
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:17.220]   19 is displayed for us in Genesis chapter 22, verse 1 through 14.
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:24.400]   If we read this as some history of Israel, you missed the whole point.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.840]   Now if I gave you my dad's autobiography, you're not going to be as excited to read
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.200]   it as I am.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.880]   Maybe a little bit because I know you, maybe, right?
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.520]   But it's not going to have the same kind of impact because that's not your father.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.520]   That's my dad.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.320]   So everything that he says in that book is personal to me.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.280]   Even if my name is not mentioned, it's personal to me because that's my dad.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:51.900]   If you read what happens in the Old Testament as a document, as a historical thing that
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:56.360]   every Christian should know, then you're really going to miss the impact of what this is.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:03.840]   Because everything that happens in this chapter is a revelation of God's love for us.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.160]   Just like one day, those of you who adopted your child, and when your child is old enough,
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.960]   you may explain to them why did you choose to do that?
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.960]   What did you prepare?
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:12.960]   How difficult was it?
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.500]   What are the problems that you had?
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.480]   And all of that is an expression of your love toward that child.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.260]   So in the same way, the story of what happens between Abraham and Isaac, and really the
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:30.720]   whole story of Israel, is specific things that God was doing in order to pursue sinners
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.040]   like you and I.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.960]   So as we are looking at this, let's put that lens on, that we don't just look at this as
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:42.200]   a historical thing that we need to understand about what it says, but what did God do to
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.000]   save you?
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.600]   What did God do to save me?
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:52.960]   Genesis 22 verses 1 through 2, it says this, "Now it came about that after these things
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:58.080]   that God tested Abraham and said to him, 'Abraham,' and he said, 'Here I am,' and he said, 'Take
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:04.760]   now your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah and offer
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:05.760]   him.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.840]   There is a burnt offering on the one of the mountains of which I will tell you.'"
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.800]   There is a burnt offering.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.320]   Now let's stop right here.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:22.720]   What God asked Abraham to do makes absolutely no sense because Isaac was the fulfillment
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.720]   of his promise.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.960]   Everything, in fact, he even says it.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.920]   And the reason why Isaac is the only begotten son, remember we talked about that, how Jesus
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.880]   is called the only begotten son, that he's not the first one and that there isn't a second
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.960]   or third one, he just happens to be the first.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.480]   That's not what that word begotten means.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:45.600]   Begotten means that he's the only one of his kind.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.480]   Just like for Abraham, Isaac is not the only son.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.320]   Remember he has an older brother, Ishmael.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.840]   But when he says, "Isaac is my only begotten son," there's no one like him because he's
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:01.960]   the one that God promised that all the promise that he made to him, to Israel, and to mankind
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.960]   was going to be fulfilled through this child.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:12.060]   So for God to ask Abraham to give him up, to sacrifice him, would make absolutely no
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:17.720]   sense from just a historical point of view.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:24.560]   But when we recognize that everything that he was doing was really to strike in our hearts
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:31.100]   what he was going to do, he wasn't really asking for Isaac's sacrifice.
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:36.840]   That through this story, he's making an impression in our heart to illustrate to us what sacrifice
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.120]   he was going to make for us.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.840]   Abraham just happened to be the object of this lesson.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.760]   He wouldn't make any sense because it says it's his only begotten son.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.640]   Not only is he only begotten son, we talked about this several weeks ago when we were
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:57.480]   on this text, he said, "He is your beloved son, the one that you love, the one that you
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.480]   adore."
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:05.280]   In fact, Jesus himself had described that way from God the Father in Matthew 12, 18,
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:13.400]   "Behold my servant whom I chosen, my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased."
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:19.840]   He's not Isaac and Abraham, it was just an illustration to illustrate that the one he
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:26.720]   loves, that he is pleased with, that he's going to offer him up.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:33.360]   In John 3, 16, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.680]   believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:45.960]   As God is asking Abraham to sacrifice your only son, your only beloved son, he was really
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:52.360]   referring to his only son himself.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:58.080]   All of this was really to illustrate not only to Abraham but to us.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.340]   To us.
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:04.800]   This was a story of our adoption and this is the sacrifice that he was going to make
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.800]   through this story.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.320]   I mean, it wasn't just that event.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.380]   Ever since man fell, he says, "I'm going to send the seed of the woman to crush the head
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.380]   of the serpent."
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:19.640]   He prophesied that and he's been preparing that way before you and I were ever aware.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:24.400]   We typically study about Jesus' sacrifice in the New Testament and we read the epistles
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.120]   and say, "Well, this is what God did for us."
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:32.440]   But our salvation history, our adoption history goes way further back.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:38.280]   In fact, a thousand years later when Solomon finally builds a permanent temple, guess where
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.280]   he builds it?
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.680]   God tells him to build it in Mount Moriah.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:49.360]   Mount Moriah is where God called Abraham to take Isaac to make his sacrifice.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.760]   So this temple was linked to Abraham and Isaac's sacrifice.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:59.760]   So that every sacrifice that they made pointed to the coming of Christ on that same place
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:05.000]   where Isaac was called to be made sacrifice.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.700]   Not only that, but God called them to go there and give Isaac as a burnt offering.
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:15.780]   Those of you started with us the book of Leviticus, the burnt offering was one of the five major
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.240]   offerings in the book of Leviticus.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:24.800]   But out of the five major offerings, it was the most important one because the burnt offering
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:29.980]   was the offering that they had to give in order to make any other offering.
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:34.040]   It was the offering of atonement, general atonement.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.960]   So there was peace offering, grain offering, guilt offering, right?
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.860]   What did I miss?
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.480]   Peace offering, grain offering, sin offering, guilt offering.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.480]   I missed something.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.480]   Oh, burnt offering.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.480]   Yeah, the burnt offering.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.480]   Okay.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.680]   Out of those five major offerings, in order to give the other offerings, you needed to
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.480]   atone for your sins.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:00.160]   So imagine the nation of Israel who had the tabernacle in the middle, the 12 tribes camped
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.500]   around him, and the burnt offering was giving 24/7.
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:12.920]   So not only did they know about it, they smelled it and they saw the flames 24/7.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:17.520]   All the blood that was shed for the sacrifice, it was mostly for the burnt offering because
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.000]   the burnt offering had to be made in order for them to come and give the grain offering,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.600]   in order for them to come to give the peace offering.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.680]   It was the general offering for atonement.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:33.000]   Now what's interesting about this is that when God told Abraham to give Isaac as a burnt
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.200]   offering, it was a human sacrifice.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.440]   And you and I know, if you study any part of the Old Testament, that God detests human
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.440]   sacrifice.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.880]   In fact, one of the main sins of why God says that Israel was going to captivity was because
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:54.640]   they were so sold out to idolatry that there are certain points of Israel's history where
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:00.000]   they were actually giving human sacrifices, and God was detesting that.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.720]   And yet here in this text, in Abraham's life, even before Israel started, he asked for human
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.760]   sacrifice.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:19.320]   See this human sacrifice that God gave was a restriction to put on mankind because he
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.200]   valued man.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.200]   Only mankind was made in the image of God.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.200]   We don't have to say that.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:33.000]   It doesn't matter how many times Peter says that, but according to truth, mankind was
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.120]   made different than all other animals.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.360]   And so God detests human sacrifice.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:44.480]   In fact, another thing that God detests in the Bible is we are not to drink the blood
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.260]   of the animal.
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.680]   As one of the most sacrilegious things to do.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:53.560]   Yet in John chapter 6, Jesus tells the people who are coming to him that if you do not drink
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:59.200]   of my blood and eat of my flesh, you have no relationship with me.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:05.480]   See that there's only one human sacrifice that God not only tolerated, but had to give
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.680]   in order to save all other mankind.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:14.080]   His sacrifice was the only sacrifice that would have raised the value of mankind instead
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.960]   of destroying it.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.400]   And that was reserved for his son and his son only.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.100]   He required this because he was planning that everything that he was doing with Abraham
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:30.920]   and Isaac so that it could make a strike, a parable in our hearts so that you and I,
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:37.700]   years later, could look back at that and recognize that this was what God was doing in history.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:43.080]   Every part of the Old Testament history is walking step by step to teach us about the
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.600]   depth of his love for us.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.640]   Hebrews chapter 9, 13 to 14, "For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:56.840]   hyphor sprinkling, those who have been defiled, sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh, how
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:02.040]   much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal spirit offered himself without
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:09.960]   blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God."
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:15.360]   Imagine again, put yourself in the shoe of God himself.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:24.600]   Oftentimes, when we think of God, we think of him as an it, a power up in heaven that
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.600]   has done great things.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.240]   So we appreciate him.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.240]   He's God of the universe.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.240]   He controls us.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.240]   He's our master.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.160]   He's our king.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.960]   But we don't consider him as a being.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:43.080]   See everything that Abraham was going through, everything that, can you imagine what Abraham
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:48.080]   was thinking and feeling when God commanded this?
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.680]   And yet God was only illustrating through Abraham, but God was actually going to do
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.480]   it.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:00.280]   Verse three, it says, "So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey."
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.060]   There's no fight.
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:06.320]   By this time, Abraham already found out that you don't question God.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:12.080]   Even if things don't make sense, he just obeyed and said, "Okay, you told me you're God.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.820]   I can't question you.
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.860]   Even the fact that I have Isaac was a miracle.
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.320]   So you gave me him.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.320]   Maybe you'll take him.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.320]   I don't know what you're about to do."
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.920]   He doesn't know, but he simply obeys.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:28.360]   And he took two of his young men with him and Isaac, his son.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:34.200]   I remember the first time reading this thinking, "Why did he take these two men?"
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.200]   I don't know.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:43.980]   And I'm conjecturing here, but if I was a father taking my beloved son to sacrifice
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:51.000]   to God, I don't know if I would want anybody else there.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   It would be a long journey to get to that point.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.740]   And it just kind of made me think, maybe he took these two young men with him because
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.600]   Isaac was not a small child.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.520]   By this time, he was a teenager.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.240]   Some say he may have been 14.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.520]   Some say he may have been as old as 20.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:13.160]   But he was not a small child.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.240]   What if Isaac resists?
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.200]   What if he realizes that what's happening and Isaac resists, that I might need these
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.320]   two men to hold him down?
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.320]   I don't know.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.560]   I may be reading into this, but possibly he may have been doing that.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.800]   Can you imagine what was going on in Abraham's heart when he was doing this?
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.680]   He said, "He split the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.440]   which God had told him."
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.560]   You know what stands out to me that all of this, God says that Abraham obeys, the two
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.760]   men go, and Isaac just kind of carries along.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.920]   There's no resistance.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.080]   There's no fighting.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.240]   All of this is done in obedience and in faith.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.680]   And that's how the Bible describes our salvation.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.400]   That God wasn't resisting.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.600]   He tried so many other ways, but he couldn't.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.760]   He said from the very get-go, he chose us.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:07.880]   He purposed to do this.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.540]   He planned to do this.
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:15.520]   And then he implemented, even thousands of years before that it ever happened, you can
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:22.880]   see his careful, meticulous planning and taking the steps that was needed.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:28.400]   Ephesians 4, 1, 4-7 says, "Just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:35.280]   that we would be holy and blameless before him, in love he predestined us to adoption
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.400]   as sons through Jesus Christ himself.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:42.560]   According to the kind intention of his will, to the praise of his glory, of his grace,
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:48.160]   which he freely bestowed on us in the beloved."
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.400]   God didn't try everything other possible way, and there was no other way.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:57.000]   So at the very last minute, he said, "Well, take my son."
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   He said he planned this.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   He willed this.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   He purposed this.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.540]   That this was his heart.
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.040]   This was his plan.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:10.600]   And we see it so clearly in what he was doing with Abraham and Isaac.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:18.000]   This was his heart, to give his only begotten beloved son.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.080]   This was his plan A. There is no plan B. From the beginning, he knew that the only burnt
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:30.800]   offering that would save sinners and reconcile us to the author of life was the life of his
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.320]   son.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.200]   So he planned it.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.360]   He purposed it.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.840]   He prophesied it.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:43.120]   And then he was walking through meticulously, step by step, to strike in our hearts, to
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.560]   strike in our minds that this is what he was doing.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:54.040]   Way before we heard the gospel, way before he brought us home, way before we said the
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:26:01.280]   sinner's prayer, God was planning, step by step.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.360]   I think about the story of the prodigal son.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.160]   He runs away, blows all his money.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.160]   And only because he had no other choice, he chooses to come back.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.520]   You know, it's better for me to be a servant, my father's servant.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.520]   And the older brother is there.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.720]   He's like, "Don't let him get away with that."
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.680]   But that's not the father.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:31.120]   That parable that Jesus taught was trying to tell the Pharisees the heart of God.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:36.280]   He wasn't sitting and turned his back, see him coming, he's like, "Okay, let him come."
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.480]   Let him come with his tail between his legs and be humbled.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:43.840]   Let him live like a servant so that he can learn his lesson.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.080]   Maybe I'll let him back in.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.320]   Let him pay for some of the things that he did.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:54.600]   And maybe a year later, maybe 10 years later, maybe I might consider.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.140]   But that's not the story that we see in the prodigal son.
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:05.800]   He tells that story to rebuke his older brother, the Pharisees, that you don't know your father.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.800]   He's waiting eagerly.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:13.180]   And as soon as he sees his son in the horizon, he runs out and he puts his robe on him, puts
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:18.180]   his slippers on him, and welcomes him back as his son and celebrates.
[00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:25.120]   Jesus tells that story as a parable to teach us who God is.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.640]   And that's exactly what he's doing here.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:39.280]   He's meticulously, step by step, to make a deep impression in us about how he loved us.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:46.960]   In verse 4, he says, "On the third day, Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from a distance."
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.720]   Can you imagine what that three days journey was like for them?
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:56.720]   That three days journey, every step that they took must have been a heavy step.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.840]   I don't think there was any jokes going around.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.640]   I don't think they were talking about anything frivolous.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.680]   My guess is it was silence.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.880]   Maybe the other people were thinking of Abraham, "Abraham's very quiet.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.380]   Something's wrong."
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:20.360]   His only beloved son, only begotten son, three days journey deliberately walking toward the
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:25.320]   place where he would need to sacrifice him because God says so.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.680]   And he finally sees the land.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.040]   He raises his eyes and saw the place from a distance.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:33.120]   Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkeys and I and the lad will go
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.100]   over there and we will worship and return to you."
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:46.760]   If you can imagine how heavy Abraham's heart was taking those steps to get to Mount Moriah.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:56.400]   Imagine our Heavenly Father that every part of Old Testament history was God taking step
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.460]   by step by step by step.
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:06.280]   If you can imagine three days or what those three days must have been like, can you imagine
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:11.680]   what it would be like for our Heavenly Father?
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:17.040]   Knowing that he would have to give up his only begotten son, that everything that he
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:23.760]   was illustrating through Abraham, the anxiousness, the hardship, the sadness, the brokenness
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.640]   that he felt, knowing that he's going to deliver him at the last minute, that God the
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.180]   Father was doing this and he was actually going to carry it out.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:36.220]   Can you imagine the heaviness of his heart?
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:44.700]   Every part of the Old Testament history from the beginning until the suffering of Christ.
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:52.740]   How heavy his heart must have been.
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:57.620]   He says, "We're going to go over there and we're going to worship."
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:58.620]   He wasn't rebelling.
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:04.460]   I don't understand what he's doing, but he says, "So we're going to go and worship."
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:08.220]   Isaiah 53, 7, it says, "He was oppressed and he was afflicted, and yet he did not open
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:13.180]   his mouth like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, like a sheep that is silent before its shearer.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:17.580]   So he did not open his mouth."
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.660]   You know why he didn't open his mouth?
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.960]   Because he volunteered.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:30.620]   Even though the Romans crucified him, even though the Jewish leaders yelled out, "Crucify
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:37.860]   him," even though they beat him and they struck him with a spear, even though by their
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:44.620]   hands he was crushed, he volunteered for this.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.980]   That's why he didn't open his mouth.
[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:53.180]   Because God the Father has been preparing this for thousands of years.
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:58.860]   And every step that he took, every event in Israel's history was God taking one more step
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.940]   to the cross.
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:02.940]   That's why he was not fighting.
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:08.620]   And Jesus himself says in John 10, 18, "No one has taken it away from me, but I lay it
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.260]   down on my own initiative.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.980]   I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again.
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.060]   This commandment I received from my Father.
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.020]   My Father wants this."
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:31.180]   Verse 6, "Abraham took the wood, the burnt offering, and laid it on Isaac his son."
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:38.700]   I don't think you need to be a father or a mother to understand this.
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:44.020]   Anybody can understand that this is a child you love.
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:52.820]   He's laying the wood that's going to burn his body and said, "You carry this.
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:53.820]   You carry this burden."
[00:31:53.820 --> 00:32:04.020]   And he took it in his hand and fired the knife, the knife that he was going to use to kill
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.820]   his son.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:10.500]   Can you imagine what was going through Abraham's mind?
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.580]   So the two of them walked on together.
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:19.500]   Isaac spoke to Abraham, his father, and said, "My father," he said, "Here I am, my son."
[00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:26.100]   He said, "Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:30.180]   How do you answer this as a father?
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:37.220]   Just in a few minutes, he's going to place his son upon the altar.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.220]   Where's the offering?
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:39.220]   What are we doing?
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:42.660]   I don't know.
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:46.900]   I would have turned around.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:47.900]   Forget all the promises.
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.380]   I don't need a great nation.
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.700]   I don't need descendants to be multiplied.
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:58.620]   I cannot give you my son.
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:02.980]   That's what I think maybe I would have been tempted to say.
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:06.460]   But Abraham knew better.
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:10.420]   Verse 8, "God will provide.
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:14.460]   God will provide for himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son."
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:19.540]   So the two of them walked on together.
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:31.100]   Can you imagine the agony and the loneliness as Jesus was marching to Jerusalem from Bethany?
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:37.660]   The final few steps that he was taking, do you remember the Palm Sunday?
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:40.180]   Everybody there is having a parade.
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:43.540]   Even his own disciples were only concerned about who's going to be glorified with you
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.740]   when the kingdom of heaven comes.
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:51.060]   So they were shaking the palm branches, "Hosanna, Hosanna, come, deliver us."
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:54.740]   And they were excited.
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.340]   Remember what Jesus was doing?
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:01.580]   He looked at Jerusalem and he wept.
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:07.100]   He wept because he knew the judgment that was coming.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:09.940]   And he also knew where he was headed.
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:17.100]   So those final steps from Bethany to Jerusalem were the very last steps that Jesus was taking
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:22.100]   to be a burnt offering for us.
[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:27.540]   Verse 9, "Then they came to the place of which God had told him, and Abraham built
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:32.620]   the altar there and arranged the wood and bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.500]   on top of the wood.
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:38.860]   By this time, Isaac must have known."
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:42.100]   By this time, Isaac must have known what is going on.
[00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.980]   And he lays there.
[00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:50.980]   My guess is Abraham was probably hoping, "This can't really be happening."
[00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:55.780]   He can't possibly.
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:58.700]   Why would he take my son?
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:34:59.820]   Why would he make that promise?
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:04.580]   Why would he go through all that drama and then take my son?
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.300]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.220]   And it doesn't make any sense.
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:13.540]   Humanly speaking, it doesn't make any sense because taking him away means to reverse everything
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:19.860]   that God did in Abraham's life from a human perspective.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.340]   He was a type.
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:28.740]   He was doing all of that to make an impression on us, to illustrate to us what he was going
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:32.020]   to do.
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:41.300]   Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.940]   I don't know about you.
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:51.940]   It's hard to discipline your kids that you love and adore.
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:56.940]   Parents say, "Oh, it hurts me more than it hurts you."
[00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:04.740]   You don't really understand what that means until you love something that much.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.900]   Most parents love their children that much.
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:11.740]   I'd rather take the blow.
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:13.340]   My kids get picked on at school.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.340]   I'd rather be picked on.
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.340]   I'd rather take it.
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.340]   I want to preserve it.
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:22.020]   And every parent makes a decision, even if they go through a hardship, I want to take
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.260]   the blows to preserve my children.
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.580]   That's our natural state.
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:31.980]   So even when we have to discipline them and we know it's good for them, even though they're
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:37.060]   going to cry, it's hard.
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.100]   Is there a way for me to take the punishment?
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:43.020]   But we can't, for their own good.
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:50.820]   But to strike a child because he was good, not only because he was good, because you're
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:55.420]   taking the hit for this other kid.
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:59.500]   He's bullying everybody, he's cussing everybody out, and he's hurting other kids, but the
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:03.460]   only way that he can survive is if my son gets hit.
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:10.140]   I mean, it's hard to discipline a kid when he deserves it.
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:20.420]   But to discipline a child, let alone offer him up, and yet that's exactly what God did.
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:24.380]   Remember reading that book, Darkness and the Glory, from Dr. Harris, chapter four of that
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:25.860]   book?
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:31.180]   Why did everything go dark in the second hour?
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.500]   From 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock, it says it went dark.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:39.660]   In fact, people even wrote songs about it, how the father turned his face away because
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:43.540]   he couldn't bear the suffering of his son.
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:47.960]   And for many years, I thought that's the only explanation that seems to make sense.
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.460]   But Dr. Harris gave an alternative view in that book, Darkness and the Glory, which makes
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:53.780]   much more sense now.
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:58.340]   God wasn't turning his face away, he was actually coming.
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:03.100]   In every instance in the Bible, when God appears, he comes in darkness because if he reveals
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.540]   his full glory, what happens to people?
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:06.540]   People die.
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:10.900]   Remember Moses, when Moses asked to see God, he says, "You cannot.
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.580]   If you see my full glory, you will die."
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:19.060]   So God covers him, and he passes by and allows him to see a glimpse of his glory because
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:20.680]   he would surely die.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:25.980]   And that reflection of his glory on Moses' face was so terrifying, people asked him to
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:31.580]   veil himself and stay in the tent because they were so afraid of his glory.
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:38.660]   See, Dr. Harris says it went dark because the father was coming.
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:43.420]   He was coming, and then he gives the evidence in the Old Testament where whenever there's
[00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:50.700]   a covenant being ratified, he shows up in darkness.
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:55.900]   And so it makes a lot more sense that that's why it went dark, because the father came
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:56.900]   to him.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.660]   He wasn't handing his son over to Satan.
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:04.260]   He wasn't handing his son over to the leaders of Israel.
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:10.220]   He himself came like Abraham took the knife and was about to strike.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:11.480]   He himself came.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.220]   He who knew no sin became sin.
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:18.540]   You know that you and I may become the righteousness of God.
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:23.020]   He traded the just for the unjust.
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.120]   And God did that.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.780]   His father did that.
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:32.020]   He placed all of our sins in that while we were yet sinners, while we were blaspheming
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.020]   his name.
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:37.660]   In order that you and I could live, he sacrificed his only begotten son.
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:44.700]   So this whole drama between Abraham and Isaac was so that you and I can understand reading
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:47.740]   now, looking back at what he did.
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:50.820]   He did that for me.
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:56.420]   He did that for you.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:02.660]   All of that was to show us and to strike in us what this gospel is.
[00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:08.580]   Verse 11, "But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, 'Abraham, Abraham.'
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.720]   And he said, 'Here I am.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:16.760]   Do not stretch out your hand against the lad and do nothing to him, for I now know that
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:21.840]   you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.'"
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:26.360]   It's not that God didn't know and that he was surprised by Abraham's faith.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:33.960]   He was all to illustrate to us, to strike in us, to teach us that when Christ finally
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:39.320]   came, one of these days when the parents who've adopted children tell the story of the adoption,
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:43.040]   one of these days when they're older, more mature to understand, you will sit with them
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.440]   and tell them.
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.080]   This is why we decided to adopt you.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:51.760]   This is what we had to go through during the pandemic.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.760]   This is why we chose you.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:53.760]   This is what we were willing to do.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.760]   This is how much it cost.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:55.760]   This is what we did.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.480]   These are the struggles that we had.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:05.720]   All of that is to tell that child how much we love you.
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:09.320]   All of this is our adoption story.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:12.440]   This is what he did for us.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:16.520]   Then Abraham raised his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in a thicket
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.240]   by his horns.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:22.440]   Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the place of
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.440]   his son.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:28.680]   Can you imagine the jubilation for Abraham when God said, "Stop," and then he sees a
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:33.320]   replacement of this ram and takes that ram and offering up that ram.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:37.440]   I was thinking maybe Abraham did it really quickly just in case God changes his mind.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.440]   Right?
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.440]   There it is.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.440]   Boom, boom, boom.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.640]   It was done in five seconds.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.640]   We did it.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:53.880]   Can you imagine the joy in his heart when God saves his son?
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:42:02.680]   But as joyous as Abraham must have been, as relieved as he must have been, this is exactly
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:06.120]   what God was going to do.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:10.280]   This is exactly what he was planning to do.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:18.400]   As much as Abraham must have been celebrating, I can imagine God, "One day I will have to
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:25.760]   do this, and there will be no replacement."
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:30.160]   And Abraham called the name of that place, "The Lord will provide."
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.360]   As it is said to this day, "In the moment of the Lord, it will provide."
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:39.780]   The word "Lord will provide" in Hebrew literally is Jehovah-Jireh.
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:43.680]   If you grew up in Sunday school and went to VBS, you probably heard that term before,
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:44.680]   Jehovah-Jireh.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:50.640]   It's one of God's most prominent names, Jehovah-Jireh, "The Lord will provide."
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.140]   Jehovah will provide.
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:56.720]   But oftentimes we use that, "The Lord will provide."
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:01.480]   You know, we're trying to buy this house, and we're competing with all these people.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:04.880]   The Lord will provide, Jehovah-Jireh.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.760]   We get sick, and we need God to answer our prayers, so we need to be healthy.
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:11.280]   Oh, don't worry, Jehovah-Jireh.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.960]   We're not sure exactly if I'm going to have a job after this pandemic.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.240]   I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:19.920]   Don't worry, Jehovah-Jireh, he will provide.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.280]   And it's not that God doesn't promise us that he will take care of us.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.680]   "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you."
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:33.160]   But his name, Jehovah-Jireh, comes in the context of him promising Abraham and mankind
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:39.240]   that he will give his only begotten son.
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.080]   That's what that name, Jehovah-Jireh, means.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.080]   You know what's interesting?
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:49.880]   The word Jireh literally means to show, that God will show, he will demonstrate.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:54.820]   So what he means by that is the Lord will declare, he will show.
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:55.820]   Show what?
[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:56.820]   Glory.
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.720]   He's going to show himself through his son.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.800]   And that's why when Jesus is going to the cross, he says, "It is time.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:09.480]   It is time to show yourself, God, that I will glorify you and you will glorify me."
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.760]   And that's what he means, Jehovah-Jireh.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:18.200]   He's going to show the world who he is.
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:23.480]   First Peter 3, 18, "For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust,
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:27.960]   so that he might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:29.720]   in the Spirit."
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:40.680]   Now, if this is just a historical fact to you, it will have no effect.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.680]   Because it's just some story.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.560]   It's like if you read my dad's autobiography.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:46.560]   Oh, it's interesting.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.120]   It's better than reading somebody that you have no idea who he is.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.120]   It's just interesting.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:54.600]   But it's not going to make an impact on you.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:45:02.760]   If you read the adoption history and you read it like it's a historical document, it's just
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:03.760]   interesting.
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:05.880]   You've learned something new today.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.920]   And if somebody asks you about it, "Oh, that's a type.
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:09.920]   That's what a type is.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:10.920]   That's what Abraham did.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:11.920]   That's what Isaac means."
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:17.680]   And you'll be able to tell them that, but it will not change your life.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:24.360]   You just happen to be a better educated person.
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:33.360]   But if this is God revealing how he loved you, how he loved me, if this is my adoption
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:42.680]   history, what he did for me, and I really believe this, how can this not change you?
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:48.120]   How can you not worship this God?
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:51.640]   How can you not have affection for this God?
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:56.600]   See, that's what a type is.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:04.320]   It's God's love story revealed to us, and he is striking.
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.320]   L-O-V-E.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:11.120]   Boom!
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:16.320]   So they would make such a deep impression in our heart that we can't help but to worship
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.320]   this God.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.640]   Let's pray.
