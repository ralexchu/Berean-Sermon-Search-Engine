[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   What's going on, fam?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   >> Hi.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.800]   >> How are you guys?
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.480]   >> Good, good.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.240]   >> Yeah, well, again, just thank you guys so much for
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.680]   the way you guys just made me feel welcome, family.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.080]   I don't skip a beat coming here.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.760]   I just don't.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.600]   Every single time that I'm with you guys as a family, I just feel just that.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.600]   So it's been really good to see familiar faces and to meet new faces.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.760]   I'm just really encouraged by what God is doing through this ministry,
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.480]   through you guys' families.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.320]   So just keep pressing on, by the grace of God,
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.320]   he's doing some wonderful things along the way.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.360]   Again, I'm gonna try not to, I always try to not be too long,
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.400]   but again, you guys are your namesake as Marines.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.240]   And so I really appreciate just the way you guys just engage,
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.320]   the way you guys engage.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.320]   I see it, it encourages me as I'm preaching.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.320]   And I came across something, and so I thought maybe I would kinda share it.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.760]   So a little, I didn't anticipate doing this, so
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.400]   it's kind of a break from me just jumping into my message and my sermon.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.320]   But I just wanted to read this.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.280]   It's an article that was on Desire to God that just came up.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.360]   And it's an edition of Screwtape.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.560]   Have you guys read the Screwtape letters?
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.480]   Maybe Screwtape, okay.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.400]   And so this is a female demon, if you will.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.840]   And this is just for my ladies, for the wives.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.920]   Maybe the Lord wants to say something through this, and
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.280]   I'm not really sure, but I'm just gonna read it.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.960]   And the demon's name is Lilith.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.520]   And the head female demon, her name is Duessa,
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.480]   she's writing a letter to this demon called Lilith.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.480]   She says, it's lovely to hear from you, darling.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.080]   I'm very glad you wrote to me.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.480]   Screwtape, poor thing, he does his best.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.280]   But he doesn't understand the feminine perspective.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.320]   Of course, that doesn't stop him from acting as if he knows everything.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.040]   And I've told him once, and if I've told him a thousand times,
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.200]   I'm persuaded that we will fare much more comfortably if we keep this just
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.160]   between us girls.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.880]   My understanding is that you've been assigned several perplexing cases to
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.760]   handle simultaneously.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.440]   You must be exhausted.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.800]   Those ridiculous secretaries and
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.280]   headquarters have the least notion of how to manage job assignments.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.040]   And I have no idea how they came to be allowed to run anything.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.680]   I'm writing you today to discuss discontent.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.280]   Now, it doesn't matter what particular topic of discontent fascinates to.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.840]   Just look for any little nook or cranny in their souls where you can insert
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.080]   the seed of discontent, making sure that they take root.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.320]   With some women, it may be best to plant the seeds of discontent somewhere
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:10.000]   around the topic of their looks, their face, their weight, their figure.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.480]   If in the off chance that doesn't seem to take latch onto the topic,
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.560]   then of relationships.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.840]   Discontent with the husband, discontent with the lack of a husband,
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.720]   discontent with the children, discontent with the lack of children.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.720]   The seeds of discontent can grow in any kind of soil,
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.520]   which is what makes it so effective.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.440]   It can really be anything.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.680]   Missed opportunities, wrong done to them in their past, failed ambitions.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.680]   All of these are good options for where to start.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.880]   The first step with each of you girls is to find just a cozy little something
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.440]   to make them unhappy and then tend it.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.480]   Tending means that you need to keep them concentrated on the thing itself,
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.240]   while keeping them from noticing the state of their own soul.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.720]   Keep them looking at their husband's failings.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.240]   He just doesn't seem to even care about my needs.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.920]   And now their own heart.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.960]   Keep them looking in the mirror, if you will.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.480]   Obviously, this means that you need to keep away from the enemy's book.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.720]   If it happens that you can't keep them from the book completely,
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.280]   you can effectively turn it to your advantage by simply making sure
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.320]   to keep all their thoughts focused on how their husband isn't living up
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.040]   to the instructions in the book.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.040]   They can serve your purpose very well.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.720]   And it's not at all a bad thing if you can get them to talk about their discontent
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.680]   with their friends, provided, of course, that they are the right friends.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.760]   You want to encourage friendships that will feed and pet the discontent,
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.200]   rather than uproot it.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.360]   Even prayer groups and mentorships are fabulous places for this to happen,
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.160]   if you manage it correctly.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.360]   Once you have the discontent well-established and flourishing,
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.320]   you have a perfectly easy job ahead of you.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.640]   You can take discontent any number of directions.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.160]   And it only requires a little bit of creativity.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.920]   Think of discontent as a small spark.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.120]   You just need to get it planted into a welcoming little pile of shavings
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.400]   somewhere, and soon enough, it spreads.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.080]   Let's say you get one of your subjects solidly discontent
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.240]   with the state of her marriage.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.160]   It will take a little effort on your part
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.440]   to direct her attention to other marriages that
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.600]   seem better than hers.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.520]   From there, you can easily fan it into full-blown envy
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.600]   of her friends or sister.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.400]   And if you can't turn that into a ruined friendship,
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.800]   then I wash my hands of you.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.600]   Lies, backbiting, cheating, refusals to forgive
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:04.760]   all are easily attainable once you have discontent well-established.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.760]   One of my favorite places to go, however, is bitterness.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.800]   It's so deliciously long-term, and it's very gratifying
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.320]   to watch a subject get more and more shriveled with it.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.080]   It lacks the spectacular showiness of adultery, of course,
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.440]   but it's often more rewarding in the long run.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.880]   If you overplay your head and you steer your subject
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.880]   into something obvious like adultery, then it's
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.520]   all too easy for them to suddenly to repent.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.120]   And then all your hard work is undone.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.240]   But bitterness?
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.800]   It achieves all the same results, but far more dependably.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.640]   Make her discontent.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.040]   Convince her that she's not worth anything.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.120]   And then drive her into all kinds of self-destructive tendencies.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.640]   Enslave her to beauty.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.680]   Leave her discontent to hold the whip that makes her run.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.560]   And if you can drive her into a profound self-absorption
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.560]   and pride, then you will be able to sit back and feel
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.160]   satisfied with your work.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.600]   The irony is that the suiting women never
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.320]   seem to notice that whether they obsess over their own beauty
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.640]   or intentionally harm themselves,
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.760]   it's all the same to us.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.520]   We win either way.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.360]   As always, give my love to that old, busy body
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.600]   shmoo-tay, your affectionate auntie, Joessa.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.360]   If that ministered to you, let it minister.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.280]   Leave you women just feeling some measures of discontent.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.040]   I just want you to be aware of that.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.160]   It's going on in your own minds and your own hearts.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.800]   And maybe the devil may be trying
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.920]   to use some area of discontent in your life
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.640]   to come in and just create those shavings that build up
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.040]   until finally he just brings you to a place
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.680]   of utter bitterness.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.960]   So I just thought I'd read that.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.920]   Well, this is the final time, the final message.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.240]   We will be going through.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.720]   We've talked about the word of God.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.520]   And from the word of God, just talking
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.800]   about the whole idea of marriage in light of eternity.
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.080]   We talked about Ephesians chapter 5.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.000]   And so my first sermon can be summed up like this.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.160]   Marriage was never made to feel those voids and annoy.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.680]   It's not mainly for intimacy.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.640]   Children are a way to avoid.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.720]   Lonely nights with his shining armor,
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.280]   its meaning goes deeper into infinite water.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.400]   A metaphor, a drama that's not known by many.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.440]   And those who do, as the years grow hard,
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.840]   they lose their memory of the infinite picture displayed.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.480]   The greatest act of love that raised Jesus' bones up
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.400]   out of the grave to save his bride, the church in his way,
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.440]   that none of us could have imagined.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.360]   Ever increasing joy in his presence forever is our mansion.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.360]   And that's why God is giving you a union, life and breath,
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.240]   so you can breathe that picture into everything
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.720]   until your final breath.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.640]   So men, fight to play the role of Jesus
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.520]   and love, shove self out of the way
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.920]   so that we can see the gospel and living color on display.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.360]   And ladies, fight to respect this man,
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.360]   no matter how far he falls short,
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.600]   that we might be able to see through your union
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.520]   what it looks like for the church of Christ on bended knee.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.760]   That's sermon number one.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.600]   - Love.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.600]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.440]   - The second sermon, we talked about sex.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.280]   That's it.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.440]   Next sermon.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.160]   We did, I had some good conversation.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.760]   I appreciated all the affirmations.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.040]   It really felt like, again, I was kind of like,
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.040]   I don't know, but just as I've been hearing more feedback,
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.880]   God is doing some good things in that arena,
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.560]   and I'm so glad.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.320]   The other, the next one we talked about
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.840]   is just the role of friendship
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.840]   and how that really is what cultivates a happy marriage.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.040]   And so now we're gonna talk about
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.120]   direction, decision-making in light of eternity
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.120]   when it comes to your marriage.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:00.080]   Decision-making in light of eternity.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.920]   I was in the car with my kids just probably a few weeks ago,
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.280]   and in the back, all of a sudden,
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.600]   I heard them discussing and asking,
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.480]   one of my kids, my daughter, asked the question,
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.000]   well, what's my sign?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.840]   I mean, there's some game she was playing on her phone,
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.320]   and well, the good pastor that I am,
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.080]   I started casting out all the demons in my car,
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.000]   and out of the demons, out of my daughter's iPod,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.440]   and then I told them, never ever again
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.120]   ask nobody about your sign,
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.680]   and don't tell nobody your sign,
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.560]   'cause that's just devil stuff.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.360]   We probably all in this room know our sign.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.840]   Orlando Sayre, in his book, Big God,
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.880]   he writes that over 60% of people in the Western world
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.720]   read the horoscope.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.720]   Women are three times more likely than men
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.560]   to consult their horoscope,
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.560]   and only half of those are young adults.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.040]   Now, why is this?
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.600]   Because we all wanna know, especially in life,
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.160]   what we're supposed to do in life-altering decisions.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.800]   What is the best course, the most vital
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.680]   and vibrant decision that we can make?
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.480]   And many times, it's because we wanna avoid pain, suffering,
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.200]   or to maximize our happiness in some area of life.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.440]   Should I give more or save for eternity?
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.280]   Should we adopt a child?
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.520]   Should I pursue a different vocation?
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.600]   Should we homeschool?
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.960]   Should I pursue chemo
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.800]   or try an alternate alternative cancer treatment?
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.000]   Should we buy this home or a less expensive one?
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.480]   Is it time for me to put my elderly parents, perhaps,
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.480]   in a nursing home?
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.120]   Should I go to the mission field?
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.720]   Should I separate from my spouse
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.680]   while we work on these painful issues?
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.920]   We all have decisions that we make on a daily basis,
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.120]   small and large.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.720]   And we as Christians can almost have our own
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.720]   superstitious approaches to hearing the voice of God.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.960]   One thing we like to do as God,
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.680]   I need an answer here, so show me a sign.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.800]   Back in the day, when I was, again,
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   the '90s dad that I am, listened to hip hop,
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.920]   and one of the icons of hip hop vehicles was the acura.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.720]   They call it the ac, and baseballs have got an ac
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.160]   and something with nicks on the back
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.720]   or something like that in the back of the day.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.480]   I didn't used to listen to baseball.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.200]   And so acuras were just these prized kind of things
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.760]   in the hip hop community.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.560]   And so I was dating, I started to date a friend
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.680]   that I had known for years when I was little
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.040]   and we started dating.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.680]   And when I called her, we kind of talked
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.520]   and said, "Let's meet up."
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.520]   And she drove up in an acura.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.360]   And I said, "Lord, that's a sign.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.800]   "This is the woman that you want me to marry."
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.680]   Well, praise the Lord that I did marry that woman.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.120]   God had something much better for me.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.080]   But we kind of can take those superstitious approaches
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.600]   to hearing the voice of God when it comes to decision making.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.560]   And Orlando Sayre, he gives some real characteristic ones
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.760]   that we use as Christians.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.720]   One, the door.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.280]   God opened the door.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.240]   If it worked out easily, then we figure that it's the Lord.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.040]   Another one that we use is the fleece.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.280]   An attempt to basically ask God to kind of jump
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.760]   through some hoops like Gideon.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.320]   And that's held out as a positive model
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.800]   for decision making.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.880]   Another one that we as Christians use is peace.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.440]   Well, I just felt peace about it.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.520]   I chose to look into some subjective kind of state of mind
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.600]   to reassure myself that the reason why I'm doing what I'm
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.400]   doing, even though it's unclear, it affirms it because,
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.560]   hey, I got peace.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.200]   And then we have the whole Russian roulette
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.600]   when it comes to Bible verses.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.040]   We use that to justify a course of decision based
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.040]   on some verse that we kind of just planned,
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.960]   and there it is.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.880]   Now, if we don't get any of these signs
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.040]   from these different things, then we end up kind of saying,
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.200]   well, I'm just waiting on the Lord.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.160]   That's the spiritual answer.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.080]   I'm waiting on the Lord.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:06.960]   I'm waiting on the Lord.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.320]   So here's the danger in some of these approaches.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.720]   And I'm not saying they're all entirely biblical,
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.440]   but the door.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.560]   God does indeed close doors.
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.320]   Paul tried many times to go to Rome.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.720]   He was prevented, it says in Romans 1, verse 13.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.560]   But he did not give up the first time
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.400]   because he didn't see the first time failure as a permanent no
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.960]   to a closed door.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.040]   On the other hand, the earthquake in Philippi
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.440]   gave Paul a literal open door to escape from prison
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.920]   in Acts chapter 16.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.840]   And he could have just stepped and walked out,
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.800]   but what did he do?
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.440]   He didn't go through the open door.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.600]   He stayed in that prison.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.320]   And because he stayed in that prison,
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.320]   the guard and his entire family came to know the Lord.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.920]   So it was actually the opening door
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.760]   that he should not have gone out of.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.280]   What about the fleece?
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.120]   I'm not saying that God doesn't give us signs
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.640]   when it comes to decision making,
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.880]   that he might choose to order events and circumstances
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.520]   in such a way that we just know, man, this is the hand of God.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.840]   But seeking out a display like that
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.840]   is not the way the scripture advises for us
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.560]   when it comes to decision making.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.760]   It's not the norm.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:22.000]   We are not encouraged to actually imitate Gideon.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.840]   In fact, Gideon had already heard from the Lord.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:33.080]   And he demonstrated, actually, a lack of faith in God
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.160]   by saying, Lord, I'm going to put a fleece out.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.240]   So he's actually an example of what we should not do,
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.160]   not what we actually should do.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.120]   And the scriptures do prohibit us from testing God,
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.160]   Matthew chapter 4, verse 7.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.840]   What about peace?
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.920]   Peace.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.160]   Man, I just need a piece of the Lord.
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.440]   I get that piece, and I know that's your answer, Lord.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:59.240]   But Jesus in Gethsemane, Matthew chapter 26,
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.720]   when he was in Gethsemane, the Bible
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:05.320]   says that he was sorrowful and troubled.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.160]   And I bet you every single one of us in this room
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.120]   are glad that Jesus did look at God the Father and say, God,
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.040]   you know, I'm really lacking peace right now.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.840]   So that must be a sign from you that I should not be here.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.520]   You see, we're glad that he stayed in that garden,
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.280]   because we now have eternal life in our souls
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.920]   because of his lack of peace.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.440]   And what about the will of fortune approach
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.840]   to hearing from the Lord of God?
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.320]   We just kind of shh.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.000]   OK.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.500]   Well, should you ever take your Bible
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.640]   and just flip it open just to get an answer?
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.120]   I don't think it's necessarily wrong
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.600]   if you want to flip your Bible open
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.920]   and hear what God has to say.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.040]   But make sure you know what it means, first of all,
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.920]   in its context.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.800]   Because then you might come up with something like this.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.960]   Judas went out and hanged himself.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.880]   And then you might turn again, shh, bam.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.800]   Luke chapter 10, verse 37, you go and do likewise.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.720]   Oh, Lord, that was you.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.400]   And what about waiting on the Lord?
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.480]   It's good sometimes to wait.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.280]   And I do it all the time.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.880]   If there's a decision that we have discerned
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.000]   that should be made, but maybe the provision isn't there yet,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.560]   then we need to wait and say, God,
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.260]   her provision is going to actually help
[00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.920]   us to know whether or not what we think you're doing
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.200]   is the right direction.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.280]   A provision that has come about is a different thing
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.120]   than just waiting.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.560]   Because sometimes we wait out of fear.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.480]   Sometimes we wait because we really know what God is saying,
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.520]   and we really don't want to move in the direction
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.520]   that He's calling us to, clearly.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.840]   So here's the question.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.680]   How can you make marriage decisions in line of eternity?
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.320]   How can you make decisions for your marriage
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.320]   that reflect eternity?
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.080]   And I want to see two things.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.080]   Where can the voice of God be found?
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.000]   Where do we hear the voice of the Lord?
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.440]   And then secondarily, how can you make marriage decisions
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.960]   in line of eternity?
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.640]   So let's go before the Lord one more time and pray.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.560]   God, first, I do bring before you again--
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.640]   not sure if that will be leading with respect to just any
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.400]   discontent in the room.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.880]   But God, I just pray, Lord, that you
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.000]   administer to those areas of discontent,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.520]   if and where they exist.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.320]   Even for the men as well in this room,
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.000]   if they have spoken to them.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.600]   And so God, I just pray that you bring a measure of contentment
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.960]   to those places.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.720]   And apply, Lord God, your truth and your promises
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.880]   to those areas that where they're needed most.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.360]   And now, God, we dive in, and I pray
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.200]   you help us to see once again what your word has to say.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.160]   And that we would make decisions based on what
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.720]   honors and glorifies you.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.480]   God, help me to honor and glorify you
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.000]   through the preaching of your word,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.040]   and to honor the text, Lord God, that you
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.360]   have given the divine inspired and irreverent word of God.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.480]   Be with us, Lord.
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.480]   Holy Spirit, please come.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.480]   Open our eyes in Jesus' name.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.920]   Amen.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.160]   OK, question number one.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.480]   Where can the voice of God be found?
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.240]   OK, now there's number one.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.480]   I'm going to give you three.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:17.080]   The most common voice, and they're all these, direction.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:22.600]   This is simply what God does for us by giving us his word.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.360]   The commands, the teachings that are in the Bible,
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.760]   the revealed will of the living God.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.880]   Things like do not steal, do not kill, love your enemies,
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.160]   be filled with the Holy Spirit, put on humility.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.080]   That's direction, clear direction.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.080]   That is the most common voice that God
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.480]   has given us to hear and to gain direction from.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:52.080]   Secondarily, the least common voice, declaration.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.640]   Declaration.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.480]   This is the least common means by which God leads us.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.360]   He simply declares to us what we should do.
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.600]   For example, in the book of Acts with Philip,
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.240]   he said, "And an angel of the Lord
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.920]   spoke to Philip, saying, 'Arise, go to the south,
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.800]   to the road that descends from Jerusalem to Gaza.'"
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.840]   God comes out and says, "This is what I want you to do.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.200]   This is where I want you to go."
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.080]   I'm not saying that does not happen,
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.040]   but that is the least common way that God gives us direction.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:26.040]   And then, lastly, the third way that God speaks,
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.680]   the voice of God can be found is decree.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.320]   Decree.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.280]   In Acts chapter 4, this basically
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.840]   is God's sovereign decrees.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:40.480]   It's designs and circumstances that cannot be thwarted
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:46.360]   by any man, animal, challenge, issue, earthquake, nothing.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.960]   Whatever God says will be, period.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.320]   Acts chapter 4, verse 27 and 28.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.280]   "Truly in this city they were gathered together
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.880]   against their holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed,
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.840]   both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.760]   and the peoples of Israel, to do whatever
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.280]   your hand and your plan had predestined to take place."
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:06.760]   Period.
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.200]   That's the sovereign hand of the living God.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.640]   Those are the three voices that we clearly
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.080]   see in the word of God.
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.360]   Now, the question becomes is, my second one,
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.920]   how can you make marriage in light of eternity?
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.160]   With those three voices, direction, declaration,
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.120]   decree.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.080]   The primary way that we can see this
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.520]   can be found in Romans chapter 12.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:35.520]   So if you would, please turn with me to Romans chapter 12,
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.960]   starting in verse 2.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:43.280]   Romans chapter 12, verse 2.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.000]   It's a very familiar verse, but I
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.640]   think sometimes we know the-- we can
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.280]   pantace the beginning and then don't
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.440]   get to the very end of the verse,
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.120]   and we'll need to start by the same.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.320]   Verse 2.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:00.800]   "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed."
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.960]   Everybody say transformed.
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.880]   Transformed.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.240]   Whenever I make you guys do that,
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.840]   it's because I want to highlight that.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.000]   Whenever I've been doing that throughout the weekend,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   I want you to remember that word, transformed.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.080]   "By the renewal of your mind."
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.360]   Everybody say renewal.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.840]   Renewal.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.440]   "That by testing--" everybody say testing.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:18.940]   Testing.
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.400]   It's clear.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.640]   "You may discern--" everybody say discern.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.600]   Discern.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:29.320]   "What is the will of God, what is good and acceptable
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.640]   and perfect?"
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.220]   I'm going to give you some steps then
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.680]   from what the word of God tells us
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.480]   with respect to how you can make decisions in light of eternity.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.680]   Step one, discerning.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.480]   The primary way that you can identify
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.240]   what God is saying in a subjective area of your life
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.160]   when you're trying to make a decision
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.680]   is by discerning the voice of God,
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.080]   by the clear direction--
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.440]   I used the word direction.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.960]   That's the most common voice.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.360]   By the clear direction of God in his word
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.160]   with the renewed mind of God.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.760]   Let me say it again.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.080]   Say it again.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.960]   The way that you most commonly hear the voice of God
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.560]   is you discern the voice of God by testing
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:25.520]   the clear direction of God in his word
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.360]   with a renewed mind of God.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:33.720]   Let me say it a couple other ways.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.800]   The primary way that we hear his voice of direction
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:42.120]   is with a renewed mind that is so shaped and governed
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.960]   by the revealed will of God in the Bible
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:49.680]   that we can see and assess all the relevant factors that
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.080]   are involved in a particular situation and decision,
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:56.600]   and we can discern what God is calling us to do,
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:01.960]   because we're so familiar with the revealed will of God.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.960]   When it comes to, for example, you as parents,
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.400]   and even you that aren't parents that will be parents,
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.240]   when it comes to schooling, here's
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:14.080]   the revealed will of God that drove us as parents when
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.160]   our kids were little all the way up to now.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.680]   Deuteronomy chapter 6.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.880]   In these words, I command you today
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.680]   that they shall be on your heart.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.760]   You shall teach them diligently to your children,
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.880]   and shall talk of them when you sit in your house,
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.160]   and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down,
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.760]   and when you rise up.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.360]   That's the revealed will of God.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.120]   And it's using that, discerning it, and then
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.280]   looking at the subjective areas--
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.720]   your own personal situation, your marriage, the schooling,
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:47.440]   the education system, all these other different things--
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.400]   to discern how you can be obedient to that.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.760]   Another one.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.040]   My mother.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.920]   Years ago, probably about 10 years--
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:01.160]   probably 13 years ago, my father was in the military.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.840]   And for the first time, he was overseas.
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.840]   And he was in Iraq for an entire year.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.280]   And so what helped me to discern the voice of God--
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.440]   this is a big decision here.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.960]   My dad's going to be gone.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.880]   My mom's going to be by herself.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.120]   The scriptures say this.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.240]   Honor your father in what?
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.280]   Mother.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:23.280]   That actual passage was spoken by Moses
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.440]   to people who were our age.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.880]   You realize that?
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.800]   It wasn't spoken to children.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.080]   You look at the Old Testament.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.240]   It was spoken to those that were in their 30s and 40s that
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.120]   had older parents, and what did it
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.880]   look like for them in their older age to honor them.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.040]   So I used that to drive discernment.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.280]   Should my wife work or stay at home?
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.760]   God's word is not silent when it comes to the priority of you
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.000]   as women.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.800]   In particular, you were made to be one helpers.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.720]   We saw that in Genesis.
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.760]   Coworkers, partnering together.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.800]   Next, home is your priority.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.480]   Titus chapter 2, verse 5.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.400]   Home is your priority.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:11.120]   And your home should be a place of industry, hospitality,
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.920]   and respite.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:18.640]   That's your role as a wife, Proverbs 31, 10 through 31.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.080]   So see, what I'm doing here is I'm
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.840]   taking the revealed will of God, and I'm
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.080]   going to then begin to apply within the aspects
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.800]   of subjectivity and decision making what it is
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.200]   that God would have me to do.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.440]   Now, before I begin to get into a little more detail,
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:39.760]   I want you to consider this with this Romans 12, 2 passage.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.000]   This is key.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.120]   Why does God make us go through the process
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:48.680]   of discerning his voice?
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.960]   God is God.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.960]   I could say, Lord, do you really want me to do A or B?
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.240]   And he could just break out of the head and be like, oh.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.160]   Like, OK, cool.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.360]   Lord, that's what you want me to do.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.120]   But how many of you have had that experience
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.920]   on a regular basis?
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:07.560]   OK.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.840]   How many of you have ever had that experience?
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.640]   But you could have.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.520]   Maybe the Lord spoke something to you.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.000]   OK.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.160]   So this is what I began to ask myself.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:21.960]   Why does he say here in Romans chapter 12,
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.560]   "Transformed by the will of your mind,
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:28.240]   that you by testing may discern what is the will of God."
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:32.080]   Why does he leave it on discerning the will of God?
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.480]   And here's what I'm going to say,
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.440]   and then I'm going to kind of break this down.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.760]   The discipline of discernment reveals the heart's affections.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:55.320]   Discernment gives us space to hear the competing voices that
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:59.440]   are directing us in our decision making.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.160]   I'm going to say it another way.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.520]   Discernment, having to discern and test,
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:07.600]   it reveals where the heart and the mind
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.640]   have yet to be renewed.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.640]   It says here, "Do not be conformed to this world,
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:17.320]   but be transformed by the renewal of your mind,
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.440]   that by testing you may discern."
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:24.440]   I'll give an example.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.600]   My daughter, Trinity, our third one,
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.320]   she went to ninth grade.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:34.040]   She's in ninth grade, and she was in a public school.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.280]   We put her in public school for the first time
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.320]   in her education.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:42.240]   And she went through pretty much OK,
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.000]   but there were some things that were present that we just kind
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.360]   of said, man, it just feels like she's kind of not flourishing
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.400]   in that environment.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.160]   There seem to be so many things that are coming against her
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.080]   with a secular agenda that all she feels in that context
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.360]   is she's fighting.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.960]   She's arguing because of the secularism that's just present,
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.120]   with all of the gender issues, with all the homosexuality,
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.960]   the transgender, the being tolerant, and relativism,
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.680]   and you can't believe the gays are this,
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.720]   and what's wrong with you.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.920]   So she's just like, boom.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:15.160]   And I remember a situation that just broke my heart,
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.440]   with my baby girl.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.880]   We were in the living room, and she
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.760]   was on her phone with some friends,
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.800]   and they were kind of texting back and forth.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.160]   And something on the TV happened with the whole gender issue.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.840]   And so she just kind of said God's view.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.800]   She said, man, this is what the Lord says.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.320]   And for you, and I think we're claiming to be Christians,
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.160]   for you as a Christian to say that God is OK with you being
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:39.440]   gay, and that's not sin, and that's wrong.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.280]   And they just attacked her.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.200]   They just attacked her.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.520]   She just walked away from that, just weeping.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.280]   She was just so broken because of that.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.560]   And so my wife and I, throughout the year, just said, man,
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.280]   it just feels like she's going through so much,
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.160]   and there isn't much.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.360]   And she just felt kind of lifeless.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.680]   And as we were battling on whether or not
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.800]   to keep her in that context, here's
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.640]   where the heart began to come out in us.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.960]   The school where she was going is a very good school
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.160]   from a moral perspective.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.880]   And the sense that if she were to graduate from here,
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.480]   she could get into some of the dopest colleges,
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.320]   have some of the greatest connections,
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.600]   have her potential realized, if you will, here on Earth
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.600]   in such a way that she could be in some very influential
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.320]   places.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.960]   And so as we began to talk about this, my wife and I,
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.160]   we began talking, and we found that our conversation was
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.120]   going toward, man, if we take her out of this school,
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.240]   she might miss an opportunity.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.240]   I mean, people at this school are going to Ivy Leagues,
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.520]   and we want her to be up there.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.400]   And she might end up going to a Cal State if we leave her.
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.280]   And you know, Cal States can't be presidents.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.320]   I mean, you don't go get a president out of a Cal State.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.400]   Anybody that's a Cal State, I ain't got no--
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.880]   all right, I went to Biola.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.280]   So ain't nobody ever heard of Biola, practically,
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.160]   but probably young.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.600]   But you know, so you know, Cal States.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:03.000]   But as we were talking about discern,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.720]   you see how we're trying to discern?
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:08.200]   God, should we take her out, or should we not?
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:13.680]   What began to rise is our hearts' affections.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:18.200]   Ooh, we're seeing some things here that
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.920]   aren't in line with God's heart.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.560]   Should those reasons be the reasons why we should
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.840]   keep her in that school, just because we
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.600]   want her to be successful here on Earth, and have a good job,
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.040]   and have influence, and have-- is that what should
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.560]   be driving our motivations?
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.640]   Ah.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.080]   And so see, discernment, God didn't tell us, yeah,
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.400]   I want her to go to this school.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.760]   Because if God had told us, yeah,
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.160]   I want her to go to this school as opposed to this school,
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.600]   I never would have seen what?
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.280]   The heart.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.520]   Even down to the little things.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.840]   Like me, I like working out and going to the gym.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.520]   OK?
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.080]   And I don't pray, God, should I go to the gym or not.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.040]   Like, Lord, can you direct me right now?
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.320]   OK?
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.680]   It would be kind of weird if I did that.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.800]   But on Monday mornings, those are my days off.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.520]   Pastor's Day, that's Mondays.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.160]   We cherish our Mondays.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.600]   And I'm just having to make a decision whether or not
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.600]   to go to the gym or not.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.920]   Well, why am I kind of considering thinking about that?
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:20.760]   Because my wife has a full-time, full-time, full-time job.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.680]   And she's really tired.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.680]   And she's really broke down.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:28.240]   And I know that if I go out of this door,
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.640]   she's going to end up having to carry everything
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.960]   with respect to the kids, because it's summertime.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.400]   And everybody's in the household.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.040]   And then I will be gone, and she's
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.600]   going to be like, dude, where you at?
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.360]   You left me here with the whole crew,
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.600]   and you're out here doing your thing.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.400]   What am I dealing with when I walk out of that door,
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.200]   and I'm like, man, I don't care.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.080]   I'm out of here.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.440]   What is that revealing in that little decision
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.040]   that I made?
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.200]   Some selfishness, right?
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:03.440]   A lack of sacrificial love that I'm called to as a husband.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:07.480]   So even in that little decision, what the Holy Spirit of God,
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.880]   in that moment, was giving me an opportunity was,
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.960]   I need you to hear my voice, son,
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.880]   and learn how to discern it.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.000]   You're about to walk out of this door.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   Your wife is in a bad place.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.160]   I've called you by the grace of God to be sacrificial
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.440]   in your love toward her.
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.320]   So what's the decision, Ray, that you
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.080]   know I want you to make?
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.240]   Lord, I know what you want me to make.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.480]   You want me to stay home.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.760]   That's what you want me to do.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.600]   You want me to sacrifice this time and stay home.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.280]   You see, when you're dealing with decisions,
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.720]   those are the kind of things that God is trying to reveal,
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.720]   ultimately.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:47.240]   What's at the bottom of your affections?
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.160]   Should I take this promotion, for example,
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.680]   and then say you have a promotion opportunity?
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.040]   And that promotion opportunity will not
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.880]   allow for you maybe to spend as much time with your family
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:01.240]   as you should, as much time with the Lord as you should.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.280]   It will distance you from church.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.840]   And it will allow maybe even because you've got to travel,
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.000]   maybe you're dealing with certain temptations
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.880]   that you should.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.960]   And then if you say, man, the boss just gave me a promotion.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.200]   I'm going to pray about this.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.960]   God, I want to know if you really
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.640]   want me to take on this promotion.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.720]   And if my boss walks through that door right now
[00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.080]   as I'm praying for this, then I know that's a sign
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.560]   and I'm going to take the promotion.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.600]   All of a sudden, you open your eyeballs
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.160]   and the boss comes in and says, hey, Johnny, how you doing?
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.040]   I just wanted you to know, man, we were really looking forward
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.360]   to you taking on that promotion.
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.000]   He said, that's the Lord.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.840]   That's the Lord.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.600]   If you then go forward with that and say, you know what?
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.240]   I'm going to use that as a sign, and I'm
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:42.000]   going to move forward with this, wouldn't that
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.680]   just reveal about your heart?
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:47.560]   Maybe God isn't as important as you say He is.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:52.160]   Maybe you have misplaced the priorities of family.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.360]   Maybe you're having some issues with respect
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:35:00.680]   to pride and attaining a certain value in reaching
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.520]   a certain high level.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:08.960]   You see, what does it ultimately reveal?
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:13.480]   God's silence in the midst of all of this
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.800]   in the midst of our decision making
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.240]   causes us to hear our own hearts' affections.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:23.560]   God's silence allows for the voice of your heart
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:28.160]   and what you treasure to sing in the process of decision making.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:35.520]   One writer wrote this, God knows that if He made His will for us
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:39.160]   more specific in decision making, more explicit,
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:44.160]   more often, we would tend to focus more on what we do
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.280]   rather than what we love.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.560]   Did you hear that?
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.360]   Like the Pharisees, we would tend
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:57.840]   to focus on more of our actions rather than our affections.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.560]   When we're not quite sure about a decision,
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:05.560]   we end up making decisions based on what we love.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.400]   End quote.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:16.240]   As German evangelist George Mueller said,
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.920]   "Ninetenths the difficulties are overcome when your hearts are
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:21.160]   ready to do the Lord's will.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:25.200]   Whatever it may be, when one is truly in this state,
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.680]   it is usually but a little way into the knowledge of what
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.240]   His will truly is."
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.120]   You see, that's why God makes us wrestle.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.120]   That's why we don't hear.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.920]   That's why that's the most common voice, one of the reasons
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:40.240]   why declaration, you don't hear that much.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.320]   Decree, you don't hear that much.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.560]   Direction is His most common.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.960]   Because as we wrestle, God uses that
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:56.560]   to help us to see our hearts and then renew our hearts.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:01.760]   Here's the mild application, marriage and life eternity.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:04.560]   I want you to look at your present decisions,
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.280]   the decisions that you've made even now,
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.640]   that you're living out.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.040]   And maybe there are some decisions
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.600]   in front of some of you guys that you
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.560]   have to make in the near future.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:18.400]   I want you to ask yourself, what are those things revealing
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.320]   about your affections?
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:27.000]   Take time to pause, stop, and examine your decisions.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.320]   Look at them and ask yourself, what is that saying
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.880]   about where my heart is?
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.920]   I'll give some examples.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:40.480]   What is your heart saying about your career choice?
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.680]   Matthew chapter 6, verse 33, Jesus says,
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:46.280]   "Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness,
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.600]   and all these things will be added unto you."
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.640]   I'm going to ask you a question.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.600]   Have you chosen your career?
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.520]   Have you chosen your job?
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.280]   Is it driven by that?
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:05.120]   Or has your decision for your career, or the job
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.920]   that you're in, or the emphasis that you're putting on it,
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.160]   revealing something else?
[00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:16.520]   There's a couple at our church, a couple of doctors.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:20.920]   And I think I was preaching, and I said one time in a sermon,
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:27.880]   the fact that if you have a job where you can't come
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:32.560]   on a regular and be in church community,
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.840]   then you need a different job.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.200]   They came to me, and they said, you know,
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.000]   Pastor Rick, I heard that, and that hurt.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.520]   That hurt.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.440]   But we know that's Word.
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.900]   That's the Word of God right there.
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.240]   Forsake not the assembly of the saints.
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.640]   The church is the bride of Christ,
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.600]   and that needs to be a priority for us.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.160]   And so as doctors, our schedules are crazy.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:56.120]   But me and my wife sat down, and we said, you know what?
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.520]   If we have to lose income, if I have
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.920]   to do some other area of medicine,
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:06.320]   if we have to maybe move or change facilities,
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.440]   then we need to be open to do that.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.840]   But right now, we're not at church on a regular
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.200]   like we should be.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.720]   We're not in the community, in the body of Christ
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.480]   like we've been called to be.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.240]   And so we're going to pray about this.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.320]   We know what His Word is.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.400]   We're going to ask God to maybe shift some things.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.240]   But if He doesn't on this date, we're changing everything,
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.560]   and we're cutting it all out.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.680]   I just loved that they were willing to do that.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.160]   And by the grace of God, God fashioned it
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.520]   in a way where all of a sudden, one of the bosses came in
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.560]   and said, you know what?
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.800]   We're going to change your schedule.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.640]   We're going to allow you to work here instead of here.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.760]   And he said, that just opened everything up for us.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.880]   And God was faithful, and He was gracious.
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:52.080]   Is your present career enhancing your relationship with God?
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.080]   Is it enhancing your ability to live out your calling
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.520]   to your spouse, your family?
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:01.800]   You didn't get married to not be around.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.880]   Is your career hindering your responsibility and your calling
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.400]   to be a part of the body of Christ?
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:11.680]   And as I'm challenging you on that,
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.680]   how does that make you feel?
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.480]   How does it make you feel that maybe God is saying, ah, maybe
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.200]   you need to take that out?
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.720]   This is standing in the way of what
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:21.520]   is the clear, revealed word of God.
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:26.280]   What about a common purpose?
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.680]   What about a common purpose?
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.200]   Are your lives-- right now, this is all hard stuff
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.160]   that I want you to start examining.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:38.040]   Are your lives set up for the Genesis calling
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:44.520]   that you've been called to as a couple, the helper companion?
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.760]   What do you do together as a family,
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:52.240]   as couples, that focuses on the fulfillment of that one aim,
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.720]   to spread the image of God through your relationship
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.560]   to the world?
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.080]   Can you guys look at each other and say,
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.760]   with our collective giftings and our personalities,
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.960]   we've come together, and we are fighting to actually live
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.520]   in the way God has called us to live,
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.760]   because He's brought us together.
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:13.160]   You see, there's a specific kind of calling
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.120]   with respect to the giftings, talents, experiences,
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.120]   and abilities that God has brought the two of you together
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.680]   that He wants you to live out.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:28.200]   Are you living a common purpose?
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.000]   Or are you guys living segmented lives?
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   I know a lot of couples.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.440]   And I tell-- when I counsel couples, when I counsel
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.920]   couples, I sit them down.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.960]   And at first, I tell the husbands,
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.560]   do you understand that you've been called to lead?
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.000]   That you've been called to lead as the husband
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.200]   to take dominion for the sake of the kingdom of God.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.120]   Matthew chapter 6 should be your mission.
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.320]   Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.760]   Are you ready to do that?
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.800]   And then I look at the potential wife, and I say,
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.880]   are you ready to come alongside this man to make that reality?
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.560]   The reason I do that is because a lot of times,
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:10.000]   that's not the driving aim for why marriages come together.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.560]   And so then they get into marriage,
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.440]   and then it's just like what the world does.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.400]   You got your job.
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.360]   I got my job.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:17.000]   And then we both kind of live our jobs.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.320]   And we kind of come together at the end of the night.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.280]   And that's kind of it.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.240]   And then we do all of the American dream stuff.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:31.000]   Do you have a common purpose as a couple?
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.400]   And is your life set up in such a way
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:39.920]   that you can make the kingdom of God and its pursuit primary?
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.240]   See, we lose perspective.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.400]   You understand at the end of the day,
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.720]   you will be in heaven for all eternity,
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:50.080]   furthering the kingdom of God and His glory.
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.840]   We're going to work in heaven.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:55.440]   That's the only reason you exist.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.840]   The only reason you exist.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.560]   And so God is calling you to engage
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.720]   in what you will be doing for all eternity.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.000]   What about wives?
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.560]   Those of you who have children, staying at home
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:17.400]   or pursuing a career, in that battle, what's
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.280]   that saying about your heart?
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.440]   Why is that a battle?
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.600]   What is the battle that's there?
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:29.960]   What affections are arising as you deal with that challenge?
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:35.360]   I said before, the word of God is not silent on this.
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.960]   The priority for you as women, especially those
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:40.280]   who have children in particular, you
[00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.200]   to be helpers, co-workers.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.320]   Genesis 2:18, we talked about it.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:50.760]   With the home as the priority, Titus chapter 2, verse 5.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.800]   And creating in your home a place of industry, hospitality,
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.160]   and respite.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:02.600]   Proverbs 31, 10 through 31.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.800]   Is that driving your decision making?
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:12.760]   Ladies and men, are you allowing an environment for your wives
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:15.760]   to be able to potentially stay at home?
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.080]   I'm not saying that it's a sin if you work.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.120]   I'm not saying that.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:24.200]   I'm not saying that it's a sin if you have a career.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.840]   I'm not saying that.
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.480]   But this is what I am saying.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:32.120]   The Bible is clear as to what your priorities are to be.
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:33.400]   Period.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.960]   And if you can't have a career and still
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:39.920]   uphold these clearly revealed will of God priorities
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.640]   when it comes to you as a woman, then you shouldn't have one.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:47.720]   I want to encourage you.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.360]   When my wife and I got married, we
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:53.040]   allowed for Titus chapter 2, verse 5.
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.840]   We allowed for Proverbs chapter 31, verse 10.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:01.080]   We allowed for the scriptures in Genesis chapter 2, verse 18.
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.160]   We saw the revealed will of God.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.520]   And we said, God, will you help us
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:09.640]   to discern what it looks like for us to live that out?
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.080]   That's why I say it's not a sin that you have a job going.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.600]   That's not the issue here.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.480]   I'm not getting at particulars.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.680]   I'm not being legalistic.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:21.000]   But my issue is the majority of us
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   don't even ask that question, I don't think.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.320]   And I don't think that we sit back and ask ourselves
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.400]   why we're doing what we're doing.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.920]   That's just what we're supposed to do.
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.600]   We go to school.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.800]   We get a good education.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.760]   And we're supposed to get a good job.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.160]   That's what's respectable.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:38.960]   But when we got together, we said, Lord,
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.160]   we know that's your passion.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:43.680]   That's your passion for family.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.200]   And so God, how do you do that?
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.880]   And where did you call this to?
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.200]   And then you were willing to make sacrifices
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.600]   to make that happen.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:56.320]   Jesus didn't say it was going to be easy to follow and didn't.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.200]   He said, you must deny yourself, take up your cross,
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.400]   and die to every single thing that you
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.920]   value for the sake of my name, the Father, me, above all else.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:11.000]   And so up to this point, by the grace of God,
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.280]   through our parenting, my wife hasn't
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:18.280]   worked in a vocation for the past almost 20 years.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.480]   Did it take a lot of sacrifice?
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.600]   Yes.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.280]   Did we lose out on some things?
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.400]   Yes.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.760]   We don't have two incomes.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.440]   I live in Compton.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.000]   We're both educated.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.920]   I got a master's degree.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.880]   She's got a bachelor's degree.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.400]   We don't have to live there.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:40.160]   But we said, you know what, Lord?
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.720]   In this setting, with all of our children,
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.160]   and all of the things that you're bringing on our plate,
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.880]   we're discerning this is the best way
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.400]   that we can ultimately live out what is clearly
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:51.880]   in your revealed will.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:53.960]   And we're willing to die to some of these things
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:54.880]   for the sake of that.
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:01.760]   Some of you guys need to consider that.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:04.360]   Some of you in your relationships
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.880]   need to consider that.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.000]   Because it's infringing upon what is already
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.440]   revealed in the will of God.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:13.040]   If it's not, go at it.
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:16.800]   Harvard's 31, she was industrious.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.120]   Next thing, and I talked about this last year,
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:23.720]   kindergarten, ruled by children.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:28.640]   Some of you, your kids are your idols.
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:32.960]   Everything revolves around the children.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:35.520]   That's not the way it's supposed to be.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.840]   That's not God's call.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.760]   Your responsibility, first and foremost,
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:42.360]   is to your own relationship.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.400]   You're supposed to bring them up in the admonition of the Lord.
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.680]   But that doesn't mean that you disappear from church.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:48.680]   I'm dealing with that.
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:49.840]   I don't know if you guys are dealing with that.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.160]   I'm dealing with that.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:52.960]   People start having families in our church,
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.920]   and all of a sudden, they get ghosts.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:56.320]   All of a sudden, they stop serving.
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.880]   All of a sudden, the church community
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.920]   has become a vital part of their lives.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.760]   And they just kind of feel like they can come
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:07.080]   and they go as a plea, because hey, they got a schedule.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.000]   I get all of that.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.760]   So you can't say nothing to me about that.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.080]   We juggle four of them, though.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.720]   So I know about schedules.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.160]   So whatever, woo, it's all good.
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.640]   Come on, come on, I got four.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:20.640]   What you want to tell me?
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.920]   Again, I'm loving the fact that the peer's back there.
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.240]   And that's what I tell our people.
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.480]   Look, somebody was telling me even earlier,
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.160]   like, you know, Pastor Ray, if you're preaching,
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:33.480]   I just need you to know, like, I forget, son or daughter,
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:34.520]   they cry a lot.
[00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.720]   And so, woo, just to that, I was like,
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.120]   I don't care that they're crying.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:38.920]   I'm immune to that.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.280]   I don't even hear that no more.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:43.400]   I have to delve some tolerance.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.920]   And so, y'all, parents in the back, it's all good.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:50.600]   Just walking that baby and just listening to the word of God.
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.200]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.120]   And here's what you do.
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.720]   You begin to communicate at an early age.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:59.040]   You understand you're always teaching?
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.160]   You are always teaching.
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.080]   Your children are watching you.
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:05.360]   And they're seeing what you prioritize.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:08.320]   And when they see you work hard to get the family together
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.640]   and get everybody up out the house and be like,
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:14.400]   no, we come in the church, they're learning.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.080]   They're seeing what you value.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:18.200]   They're seeing your priorities.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.440]   And they'll begin to embrace those things themselves.
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:28.120]   I like what Francis Chan's wife said in the book when talking
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.080]   about taking their kids to the park.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.320]   Am I taking my kids to the park because I just
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.760]   want to have a nice fun experience
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.260]   and just kind of get some fresh air?
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:37.520]   And those are all good things.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:39.280]   Or am I taking them to the park because I
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.360]   want to invite a few moms that don't know the Lord
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:43.360]   and I can start fellowshipping with their moms
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.680]   while the kids are out there on the playground playing?
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:47.680]   It's a different perspective.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.640]   I like that.
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.240]   Again, what is your heart telling you?
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.680]   Here's another one.
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:55.000]   What is your heart telling you when
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.320]   you look at the educational choices
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:00.560]   that you're thinking about making or you are making
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:01.680]   for your children?
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.400]   What is your heart telling you?
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.800]   I'm not telling you one thing is a sin or not,
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:08.360]   because I already told you I had my daughter in public school.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.040]   I've done homeschooling.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.640]   I've done Christian school.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:13.920]   And I've done public school.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.680]   So I have run the gamut.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:21.760]   But again, here's the question.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:27.480]   Why are you doing what you are doing?
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:33.200]   Have you intentionally put them wherever they are presently
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:36.160]   because you believe that that's going to honor Deuteronomy
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.960]   chapter 6 and these words I command you,
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.000]   that you shall teach them?
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.680]   Deuteronomy 6 didn't say that the school
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:46.480]   boards should teach them.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.840]   It doesn't say that the church should teach them.
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:53.240]   It tells us as pastors to equip the saints
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.000]   to do the work of the ministry.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.480]   The children's ministry should not
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.600]   be a fool for your children.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.800]   What is that telling us?
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:05.360]   Ultimately, what's driving the decision making?
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:10.080]   Deuteronomy chapter 6 says you're supposed to teach them.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:15.400]   So we allow for that clear direction in the word of God
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:19.400]   to determine how we educated our children.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:23.760]   Again, what I'm getting at is are biblical categories
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.720]   driving our decision making?
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.520]   Can you look at every single decision
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.720]   that you have made and/or are making and say,
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.560]   the reason why we're doing this is because the word of God
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:34.640]   says this.
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.760]   And we believe this will fulfill this best.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:43.400]   And that's how we try to drive everything.
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:47.200]   And so the reason why we did homeschooling early on for us
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.400]   was because--
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.320]   and it's all over the place.
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.480]   I was a teacher for 13 years.
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.120]   So I know what is in the educational system.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:59.080]   All this gender inclusive stuff, people shaping my kids,
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.680]   they're sitting down with somebody
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:05.200]   that I don't even know for six hours.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:08.920]   We have to be at least aware of that as parents.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:11.200]   They're being shaped.
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:14.640]   And they're being shaped by a secular culture
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.040]   in a secular world by individuals
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.160]   that don't know and love God and whose
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:22.800]   God is the God of this age.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:26.960]   And so for us, as we looked at the word of God and said,
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:29.520]   Ruth, it's your responsibility to teach them all
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:32.080]   that God has revealed in his word.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.800]   Well, if that's the case, then we'll
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:35.520]   keep them home for a little while.
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.120]   And then we got to a place where we couldn't do it,
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.720]   we're going to put them in a Christian school
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.280]   where at least now they're surrounded
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:43.840]   by individuals that have a biblical worldview
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:47.160]   and can pour that biblical worldview into them.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:53.560]   Are you in the live off of one income, maybe,
[00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:58.240]   because the best decision that you discern in living out
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:02.520]   the word of God here in Deuteronomy 6 is homeschooling?
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:04.880]   Maybe you need to change your budget
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.360]   and let some things go so maybe they
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:09.320]   can go into a Christian school.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:12.080]   Are you invested in their classrooms?
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:15.440]   Do you know their teachers if they're in public school?
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.720]   Do you know the curriculum?
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.800]   Are you going in and saying, I'm going to find out
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.360]   what y'all teaching my kid?
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:22.520]   I'm not just going to trust you with my child.
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:25.160]   I need to come up here and let you know I'm a believer.
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:26.200]   I'm a Christian.
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:28.720]   And I'm going to ask you, please, if you can respect that.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.560]   And so when it comes to these types of things,
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:32.200]   even though this is a public environment, if you could,
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:34.000]   please, make sure that you inform me
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.920]   if you want to talk about certain things that
[00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:38.000]   are contrary to the worldview that I'm
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.640]   trying to teach my kids.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:41.120]   That's why I bring in every context.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.520]   Public, I'm doing it.
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:46.320]   So again, I don't want nobody offended up in here.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:50.640]   But my question is, I put them in this public setting,
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:54.120]   and I want to do what I need to do what's best to live out
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:55.680]   Deuteronomy 6.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.200]   I'm going to say it again.
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:00.080]   It's your responsibility to raise your kids
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.200]   in that abolition environment.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:03.880]   Nobody else's.
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:08.440]   And you will be held accountable for that.
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:09.760]   And here's the issue.
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:13.280]   You're dealing with an eternal soul.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:16.320]   We're dealing with heaven or hell.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:19.880]   These are weighty realities that need to weigh in
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:22.720]   on our decision making.
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.400]   My point is, are your decisions being
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:28.680]   driven by the clear directional voice of God?
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:35.160]   You see, what happens in your heart
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.760]   is the issue that I want to get at.
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:43.960]   Someone asked me just yesterday, where is your daughter
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:44.640]   going to school?
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:50.720]   And I just told her, I said, yeah, Christian school.
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.560]   She kind of asked, well, why is that?
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.060]   And there were some issues with her.
[00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:56.800]   I think her development, that's just the best setting.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.240]   The secular schools now are--
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.280]   colleges are crazy.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.200]   They just crazy.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.040]   They crazy.
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.500]   So I'm just telling you as parents,
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:07.520]   once y'all get to that place, oh, boy, I don't even know.
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.320]   I really don't.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.160]   It's frightening.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:12.800]   And so I'm saying it here.
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:16.120]   Just don't go with the flow.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:19.160]   Be aware of what you are doing and where
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:21.560]   you're placing your children, even when they
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:24.040]   get to this stage and this age.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:26.160]   So for us, with Mariah, we just felt like, man,
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.200]   this is the best environment for her.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.720]   We may think differently with our others.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:35.840]   But the reason I bring up the education piece
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:40.080]   is what I showed them was my daughter.
