[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.320]   Hi, my name is Nick.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.160]   I've been coming to Berean since January, and I'm very excited to get baptized today.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.120]   I grew up going to church with my family.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.480]   I absorbed everything I learned in Sunday school and tried to be a good kid for my parents'
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.480]   sake.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.640]   As a child, life seemed to be all about following the rules, and this seems simple enough.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.720]   In ninth grade, I made the choice to follow Christ but did not get baptized because I
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.800]   felt like I had no testimony.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.280]   If you were to ask me then how Jesus changed my life, I would say, "What do you mean?
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.960]   I'm just doing what I'm supposed to do."
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.040]   My life since then has not been a God-honoring one.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:53.040]   My heart has been filled with anger, lust, grudges, self-hatred, and beneath it all,
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.120]   pride.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.360]   When I think about how utterly sinful I am, I'm reminded of shameful moments in my life,
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.760]   many of which stem from pride.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.360]   I harbored bitterness toward church peers because I felt like they didn't give me enough
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.120]   respect or time.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.960]   I raged uncontrollably at home when my parents challenged my infinite teenage wisdom.
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.440]   I became a hypocrite, obsessed with keeping up the image of being a good Christian, especially
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.480]   to my secular friends.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.880]   I confessed to follow Christ but contorted God's word in my heart to excuse my own sinfulness,
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.280]   even despising God because I wrongly felt like I wasn't getting what I deserved.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.200]   Last year, God finally showed me what a fool I'd been.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.880]   He took away nearly every relationship I had, and it was just him and me, and I had a lot
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.840]   of time to reflect on how my life was going.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.680]   Despite how ugly I was and how much I pushed him away, God comforted me in my solitude.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.840]   I was so overwhelmed by his love and saw the wickedness of my desire to build up my own
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.200]   image.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.840]   God tore me down to reveal the truth for the millionth time, that to live, I must accept
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.360]   Jesus as my Lord and Savior, that his sacrifice has freed me from my sin, and that the purpose
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.440]   of my life is to glorify God.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.560]   While this moment drove me to seek God earnestly and walk away from a life of self-seeking
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.800]   hypocrisy, I still behaved like I was trying to save myself.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.320]   I read the Bible more, prayed more, and immersed myself in the church community, but I never
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.420]   went to God and asked for his forgiveness.
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.180]   But through Berean, God opened my eyes again to just how much my pride was still hindering
[00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.580]   me, and I was crushed knowing that all I wanted to do was obey, but failing so much because
[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.420]   I was ultimately still depending on myself.
[00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.900]   Again God brought me to a place of repentance.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.980]   I saw his forgiveness for my deep and sinister pride, and he has poured it out generously.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.340]   By his grace, I am learning to live in real freedom from my sin and to have the right
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.780]   posture before God.
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.540]   I am continuing to unlearn, leaning on my own ability, and to instead remember Christ's
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.860]   sacrifice and trust in the hope he brings.
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.140]   God is so, so good.
[00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.120]   He's teaching me that it's not about being perfect, but being obedient.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.660]   Jesus is the perfecter of my faith, not me.
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.220]   I want to keep humbling myself before him and stop fighting his way.
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.060]   I want to follow him and live.
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.060]   Thank you.
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:21.060]   [applause]
