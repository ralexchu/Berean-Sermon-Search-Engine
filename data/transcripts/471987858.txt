[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.520]   If you guys have your Bibles with me, the bulk of today's message will be coming from
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.800]   Deuteronomy 8.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.980]   It's going to be up here for you, but I do find it helpful when I actually have the text
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.940]   open just throughout the sermon.
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:27.200]   So Deuteronomy 8, verses 1 through 7, and I'm going to be reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.680]   All the commandments that I am commanding you today, you shall be careful to do, that
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.080]   you may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swore to give to your
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.020]   forefathers.
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.980]   You shall remember all the way with which the Lord your God has led you in the wilderness
[00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.200]   these 40 years, that he might humble you, testing you to know what was in your heart,
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.960]   whether you would keep his commandments or not.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.500]   He humbled you and let you be hungry and fed you with manna which you did not know,
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.480]   nor did your fathers know, that he might make you understand that man does not live by bread
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.000]   alone, but man lives by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.200]   Your clothing did not wear out on you, nor did your foot swell these 40 years.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.200]   Thus you are to know in your heart that the Lord your God was disciplining you just as
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.560]   a man disciplines his son.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.840]   Therefore you shall keep the commandments of the Lord your God to walk in his ways and
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.440]   to fear him.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.200]   For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.760]   fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills."
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.760]   Every nation has significant events or moments in their history, and many of the events are
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.560]   either annually celebrated or they are so painful that they are rarely talked about
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.560]   or discussed.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.240]   So no book on Chinese history will leave out the Cultural Revolution, the Opium Wars, the
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.120]   Great Wall of China being built by the Ming Dynasty.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.920]   The books on the US will discuss at length the American Revolution, the Great Depression,
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.720]   or the Civil Rights Movement.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.720]   So every nation has significant moments in its history that its people remember proudly
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.980]   or events that they would rather forget.
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.600]   So the same is true for the people of Israel in both the Old and the New Testaments.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.760]   The nation of Israel had many significant events that they were called to remember.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.000]   The Passover is a big one.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.820]   The building of Solomon's Temple is another.
[00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.960]   The Babylonian captivity is an especially painful one, and you have the entire book
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.320]   of Lamentations emotionally devoted to that event.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.820]   One of the most significant ones, though, in Israel's history is the wilderness wanderings
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.020]   in the time of Moses.
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.740]   So it's so significant that you have about 40 of the books of the Bible reference the
[00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.280]   wilderness wandering, and Israel is often called to reflect on it.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.920]   So they had left Egypt with so much hope.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.420]   They crossed the Red Sea in awe of God's power, and they were excited about Canaan, the land
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.760]   flowing with milk and honey.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:21.340]   And then came this wilderness, and the wilderness had been hard.
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.780]   It had been a horrible experience for the Israelites, and of the 600,000-plus of the
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.640]   people who had left Egypt, only two actually made it through the wilderness and into the
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.640]   Promised Land.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.500]   So everyone else was either, like, struck down, bitten by venomous serpents, or literally
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.020]   the earth swallowed them whole.
[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.680]   And the wilderness wandering wasn't just hard, it was also seemingly endless.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.080]   The journey from Egypt to Canaan should have taken about 11 days, but it took them 40 years.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.200]   And 40 years is a long time.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.900]   You guys are very familiar with COVID and pandemic, right?
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.000]   You know, we've been in lockdown for 31 weeks now.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.980]   I counted, 31 weeks, like two days.
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.360]   And 40 weeks would be a horribly long time under any kind of suffering or wilderness
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.920]   wandering, but the Israelites were there for 40 years.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.300]   What was your life like 40 years ago?
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:33.700]   I was living in Korea, sporting a fresh bowl cut, eating choco pie, and toddling around
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:40.280]   and falling and eating dirt, probably.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.760]   You guys, most of you have not been around that long.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.640]   Most of our church is under 40.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.120]   So the wilderness was hard, and it was 40 years long.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.280]   So as I said, the wilderness wandering of the people of Israel was one of the most significant
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.060]   and most painful chapters in their history, and they were constantly exhorted to reflect
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.020]   on it.
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.760]   And in the scriptures, you and I as new covenant people of God are also called to reflect on
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.760]   it.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.320]   And that's what we're going to be doing a little bit this morning.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.620]   And I just read for you in the beginning, the opening of Deuteronomy chapter 8.
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.220]   The book of Deuteronomy is written toward the end of the wanderings with the land of
[00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.840]   Canaan in view, and the people of God are finally about to enter into the promised land.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.060]   Deuteronomy is addressed to the second generation of the people of Israel, almost all of whom
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.220]   had never known life in Egypt.
[00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.440]   And in chapter 8, we have Moses' own commentary and reflection on this 40-year journey.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.200]   So for you guys who are taking notes, we're going to be looking at four biblical truths
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.900]   about the wilderness wandering, and we're going to be looking at four things Deuteronomy
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.360]   teaches us about this wilderness wandering.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.520]   And I'm going to give you three up front, three truths or points up front, and then
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.120]   we're going to tackle the fourth one at the end in application.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.400]   One, the wilderness wandering was on purpose.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.400]   It was on purpose.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.720]   Number two, the wilderness wandering was for testing.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:18.760]   And the third point that we glean is that the wilderness wandering was for training.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.120]   It was on purpose for testing and for training.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.200]   So the first point, the wilderness wandering was on purpose.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.720]   Deuteronomy 8.1, I'm going to read that for you again.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.000]   All the commandments that I am commanding you today, you shall be careful to do, that
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.880]   you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the Lord swore to give to your
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.120]   forefathers.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.160]   So Moses begins by telling the people that God will soon deliver on his promise to give
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.220]   them the land of Canaan.
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.520]   He calls their attention to God's covenant with Abraham, and in Genesis 15, that's where
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.440]   God makes this covenant with Abraham, swearing that Abraham will have many descendants and
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.440]   they will possess the land of Canaan.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.800]   In Genesis 15, Abraham is already physically living in the land of Canaan.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:17.160]   But the narrative tells us that Abraham believed God, trusted in this promise, and his faith
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.320]   was credited to him as righteousness.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:25.740]   And then later in that chapter, God proceeds to tell him the things that will happen before
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.680]   all of these things are fulfilled.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.680]   Okay?
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:35.440]   So Genesis 15, 13 to 16, God said to Abraham, "Know for certain that your descendants will
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.280]   be strangers in a land that is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and oppressed
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.400]   400 years.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.280]   But I will also judge the nation whom they will serve, and afterward they will come out
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.160]   with many possessions."
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.000]   As for you, "You shall go to your fathers in peace.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.680]   You will be buried at a good old age."
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:00.440]   And then in the fourth generation, they will return here, where the iniquity of the Amorite
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.280]   is not yet complete.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:09.280]   So using the words, "Know for certain," God tells Abraham that with absolute certainty,
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.200]   one, his descendants will be enslaved and oppressed 400 years.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.240]   Two, with absolute certainty, they're going to leave Egypt, having plundered them, having
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.440]   become very wealthy.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:27.640]   And three, they will return to the very land that he is standing on once the iniquity of
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.480]   the Amorite is complete.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.800]   The Amorites were living in the land of Canaan during the time of Israel's wanderings.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:40.600]   And just a little bit of an insight, Amos 2.10 reads, "It was I who brought you up from
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.840]   the land of Egypt, and I led you in the wilderness 40 years, that you might take possession of
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.880]   the land of the Amorite."
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:53.840]   So the 400 years in Egypt, the exodus out of Egypt, the wilderness wandering, and the
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:59.480]   return to the land of Canaan are all spelled out in advance for Abraham in the book of
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.320]   Genesis.
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.600]   So how did they end up in Egypt?
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.600]   We see that the Israelites were not in Egypt as slaves because of their sins.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.200]   There's no record of any particular sins at the end of the book of Genesis or at the
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:19.220]   beginning of Exodus that give us reason to believe that the slavery period was judgment
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.500]   on the people.
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:27.760]   We read in Exodus 1.8 that the new king of Egypt did not remember Joseph.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.160]   So that's the only reason given for the explanation, like that's the only explanation given for
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.400]   the reason why they're slaves.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.120]   Pharaoh never learned about Joseph.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.920]   So all of this was on purpose.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:45.400]   The famine that initially forced the patriarchs out of Canaan into Egypt, on purpose.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.680]   The 400 years of slavery, on purpose.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.880]   And the journey through the wilderness was also on purpose.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:58.760]   And through all of this, God desired worship, and he wanted his people to know that he was
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.600]   worthy of it.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:07.080]   So in his confrontations with Pharaoh, what is Moses commanded to say to him?
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:16.800]   Exodus 7.16, "You shall say to him, 'The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, sent me to you, saying,
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.560]   let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness.'"
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:26.360]   It wasn't let my people go so that they may serve me after they get into the land of Canaan.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.680]   It was that they may serve me in the wilderness.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:36.800]   So they were in the wilderness for the purpose of worship and service to God.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.960]   So the books of Exodus and Numbers make it seem like the reason for the wilderness is
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.400]   Israel's sin.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:50.560]   But here in Deuteronomy, God says that he deliberately led them there.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.760]   Israel's sin caused them to wander in the wilderness.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.960]   That's biblical truth.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.040]   God's good purpose caused them to wander in the wilderness.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.040]   That's biblical truth.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.040]   Now, is this a contradiction?
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.720]   No, it's a paradox.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:14.480]   It is a truth that cannot be explained without some degree of logical or emotional discomfort.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:20.880]   And there are at times very difficult circumstances and events in our lives that God has deliberately
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.040]   purposed.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.600]   Sometimes these circumstances and events are consequences of our sins.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:34.680]   Sometimes they are events divinely ordained for our good or for the good of his people.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.800]   Sometimes they are both.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:42.760]   But whichever the case, James 1, verse 2, many of you guys know this passage.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:48.000]   Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.560]   Why?
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.280]   Because our good God has purposed them.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:59.440]   So there are seasons of trial ordained by God that sometimes feel like 40 years.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.760]   They're endless.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:07.880]   If a trial just lasted a day or two, most of you guys would embrace them.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.320]   Trials are good for us.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.440]   Builds character.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:17.880]   But sometimes a season of God-ordained trials seem to last an eternity.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:24.760]   And the longer these trials go, we are left to wonder if they are a result of our sins.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.840]   And when the trials do not go away somewhat quickly, or after we've prayed many prayers,
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:36.000]   we might wonder, "Why is God not providing immediate relief?"
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.080]   We wonder if it's because of our lack of faith.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:48.040]   Perhaps maybe I'm not praying enough, or I'm not praying the right prayers well enough.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:55.960]   And we wonder if God is indeed a God of love, if he is indeed good.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:03.560]   So no normal human being enjoys the tests of the wilderness.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:09.040]   But we'll see in Scripture the wilderness wandering of Israel was on purpose.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:15.880]   And the wilderness wanderings ordained for us in our lives are also always on purpose.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:21.960]   So regardless of the who, what, why, when, and where the wilderness that you may currently
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:32.360]   be in now, one thing is for certain, God in his sovereignty and in his goodness has purposed
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.360]   it.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.360]   Amen?
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.920]   Second, the wilderness wandering was for testing.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:44.480]   Deuteronomy 8, 2-3, "You shall remember all the way which the Lord your God has led you
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.680]   in the wilderness each forty years, that he might humble you, testing you to know what
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.160]   was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments or not.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:00.240]   He humbled you and let you be hungry and fed you with manna which you did not know, nor
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.520]   did your fathers know.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:07.280]   That he might make you understand that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.240]   by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord."
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:18.640]   So we read here that God led them into the wilderness on purpose to test them and to
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.760]   humble them.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.600]   And ultimately the test was to see if they would trust him, if they would obey him.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:32.080]   The test was to see if they would have faith in the God who had led them out of slavery,
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:37.520]   destroyed their enemies and all their strongholds, to see if they would trust him to lead them
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.200]   into the promised land.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.200]   But with each passing year, remember, forty years, not a short time, with each passing
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:52.940]   year, each obstacle, every bout of thirst and hunger, the Israelites grumbled and complained.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.520]   On the surface they may have looked okay, but they're like sponges.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:02.840]   As soon as you squeeze them a little bit, the stuff that's on the inside comes out and
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.860]   gets exposed.
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:12.440]   So the wilderness squeezes expose their faithlessness, the squeezes betray their rebellious spirit,
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:20.120]   their cowardice, their selfishness, and what was exposed is that indeed their God is their
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.240]   bellies.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:27.080]   The Israelites were inclined to evil and self-destruction all the time.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:33.440]   They were a bunch of stiff-necked, ungrateful whiners.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:38.600]   They were weak, helpless and powerless, but they had the audacity to curse the God of
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.400]   the universe and to blame him for this misery.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:48.000]   If only you hadn't cared about us and led us out into this desert, we would rather be
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.240]   in Egypt and eat leeks and cucumbers and garlic, we would rather be slaves than to follow you,
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.200]   you horrible God.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:03.640]   So God had delivered them out of slavery and showed them miracles and wonders, but the
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:10.920]   perpetual cry of their hearts was, "What have you done for me lately, Yahweh?"
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:16.360]   Let me read this section of Deuteronomy 8-2 again for you, to know what was in your heart,
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.600]   whether you would keep his commandments or not.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.040]   The wilderness wandering was for testing, is our second point, right?
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.680]   I have a very important question for you.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:31.400]   Who were the tests for?
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:36.640]   Were the tests for God's benefit so that he could see what was in their hearts because
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.040]   he wasn't sure?
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.280]   Was it because God had his suspicions?
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:47.800]   Did God need some kind of confirmation or evidence that they would in fact turn out
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.480]   okay?
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.180]   No.
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.600]   God is omniscient.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.600]   He is all-knowing.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.760]   He already knew what was in their hearts.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:02.600]   The tests were for Israel's benefit so that in their humbled and their helpless state,
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:08.800]   they would seek God, that they would learn to trust and put their hope in God alone.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:14.520]   They need to learn this and to teach them that they were not saved because God knew
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.520]   that they would be good at obeying.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:24.600]   Praise the Lord that God, praise him that he did not save us because of our ability
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.600]   to obey.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.600]   Amen?
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.080]   Amen.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:33.360]   We may be shocked when we see the sins come out of our hearts, hear the things that come
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:39.440]   out of our mouths, but God is never taken by surprise by our depravity.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.440]   He saves and loves anyway.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.780]   So what was the testing for?
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.640]   We see the answer in verse 3.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:53.920]   To make you understand, the man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by everything
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.480]   that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:02.920]   Israel was created by God and for God to love God and to serve God, but rebellion and
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.520]   rottenness was at the very core of their hearts.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:13.360]   Israel was created by God and for God to love God and to serve God, but in their core, they
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.160]   hated that purpose.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:21.560]   Acts 17.28, Paul in front of the Areopagus, this is what he says, "That in God we live
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.240]   and move and exist."
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.600]   Other translations say, "In Him we live and move and have our being."
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:31.660]   But in God we live and move and exist.
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:36.880]   But for you and me, oftentimes, in our rebellion and foolish arrogance, we often think that
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:42.840]   God lives and moves and exists to serve us.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.160]   God had never needed Israel.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:53.200]   Israel had always needed God because Israel too had inherited Adam's sin nature.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:59.440]   Israel would always default to faithlessness, forgetfulness, rebellion, and placing hope
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.960]   in all the wrong things, walking by sight and not by faith.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:10.120]   And without God's intervention, Israel would destroy themselves, be ravaged by their neighboring
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:15.800]   enemies, and seek always to worship created things rather than the Creator.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:21.440]   And that would never lead to them being fully satisfied.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.960]   So why did God deliberately allow Israel to feel hunger?
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.520]   Was that His cruelty?
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.900]   No.
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:33.080]   Because bad things always happened when they were full.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:37.360]   Hosea 13, verses 4 through 6.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.200]   Yet I have been the Lord your God since the land of Egypt, and you are not to know any
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.360]   God except me, for there is no Savior besides me.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:51.320]   I cared for you in the wilderness, in the land of drought.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.960]   As they had their pasture, they became satisfied.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.200]   And being satisfied, their heart became proud.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.480]   Therefore, they forgot me.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.680]   And Jeremiah calls it the fountain of living water.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.880]   They forgot me.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.360]   Man needs saving.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.360]   Man cannot save himself.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:16.160]   But the problem is that oftentimes man believes that he can.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:23.280]   Man needs humbling, because in arrogance, man is destined and doomed to wrath.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:29.520]   The Israelites needed to understand that there is nothing good in and of themselves, that
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.440]   there is no worth in and of themselves, and that the only reason they are a chosen people
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:40.200]   of God, that they are a royal priesthood, is because of God's mercy alone.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:46.200]   So the wilderness wanderings, one, were on purpose, and two, they were for testing and
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.200]   exposing and humbling.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:55.600]   And likewise, there are wilderness wanderings ordained in our lives to show us that there
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:02.360]   is nothing good in us outside of Christ, that we live and move and exist solely by the grace
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.320]   of God.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:11.080]   And the wilderness seasons in our lives expose oftentimes our sins and painfully remind us
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:17.160]   of our need for a Savior, lest we forget that we do not live by bread alone, but by everything
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.200]   that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:29.320]   Brothers and sisters, you were created by God and for God to love God and to serve God.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:36.440]   And praise the Lord that the wilderness wanderings in our lives remind us of that purpose.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.960]   Praise God that the wilderness wanderings in our lives help to wean us off the things
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:46.760]   of this world, teach us to worship the Creator rather than created things, because again,
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.760]   created things will never satisfy.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.280]   That's a lie.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.920]   Praise God that we often get dissatisfied during the wilderness because it makes us
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.400]   long for home.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:09.040]   So our call is to praise him in the wilderness and through the wilderness.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.800]   The wilderness was on purpose.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.800]   The wilderness was for our testing and our humbling.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:20.200]   And third, the wilderness wanderings were for the purpose of training.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.520]   They were for training.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:28.280]   Verse four and five reads, "Your clothing did not wear out on you, nor did your foot
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.960]   swell these forty years.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.160]   Thus you are to know in your heart that the Lord your God was disciplining you just as
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.320]   a man disciplines his son."
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:41.800]   Now the word discipline, it feels negative, right?
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:47.920]   Here God is training Israel to trust him and to obey him in faith.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.040]   Israel had been an orphaned people.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:57.120]   God the Creator of the universe had handpicked and adopted and had vowed to be their Abba
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.320]   Father so that they would be orphans no longer.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.320]   They would be loved.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:09.280]   Hosea 13 and 14, the last two chapters of the short book, reflect on the wilderness
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:19.240]   wanderings and Hosea's conclusion here is, "For in you only the orphan finds mercy."
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:25.200]   The Lord their God in the wilderness was treating them as beloved sons.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:32.480]   Love motivated and saturated discipline is a tremendous blessing to a child.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:37.960]   Beloved children are trained up and disciplined.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.360]   Orphans are never disciplined.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.160]   Orphans are often neglected or abused.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:50.760]   They are left to fend for themselves, usually to their harm, but this would not be the case
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.520]   for Israel with Yahweh as their Abba Father.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:24:03.360]   So as a good father trains a son in all things, disciplines with loving correction, God would
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.440]   be a good father to Israel.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:12.620]   He was their creator, yes, he was their king, but he would also love them as a father loves
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:13.960]   his child.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:21.320]   Correction, building up, teaching, exhorting, and when necessary, the rod, they are all
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.960]   evidences of love.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:29.240]   So God the Father was more active and directly and physically tending to his people in the
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:34.080]   wilderness than at any other time in Israel's history.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:37.740]   He took care of everything that they needed.
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:42.520]   He let them understand hunger, but he did not cause them to starve.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:47.660]   He allowed them to feel thirst, but he gave them water whenever they needed it, not always
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.480]   when they wanted it, but when they needed it.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:57.160]   He knew that in their immaturity, they would need visible evidence of his presence.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:05.160]   So he led them by a visible pillar of cloud and he led them by a visible pillar of fire.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:12.260]   And what's more, you look at Deuteronomy 8.4, 40 years their clothes did not wear out.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.960]   Their feet did not get swollen.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.800]   Did you read that?
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:22.000]   For 40 years, the clothes that they walked in, slept in, and labored in did not wear
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.400]   out.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.120]   I don't know what kind of material does not wear out with that much usage.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:32.800]   They likely wore the same things day after day and yet the material stayed intact, not
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:39.160]   just for 40 days, not for 40 months, but for 40 years.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:44.080]   Do you think textiles were readily available in the wilderness?
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.840]   Do you think material for crafting garments was readily available in the wilderness?
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:48.840]   No.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:53.320]   My guess is that the clothes that they were in at the end of the journey were the same
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:58.600]   ones that their fathers had been in when they exited in haste from Egypt.
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.560]   40 years.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:07.080]   And Deuteronomy 8.4 also says that their feet did not swell.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:12.320]   They weren't necessarily genetically enhanced feet, but all that wandering did not cause
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:18.280]   their feet to swell and it wasn't just their feet.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:24.640]   If you run on a smooth treadmill with the best Nike running shoes long enough, they
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.480]   will wear down after a year or two.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:36.560]   But for Israel, in the midst of all of that rocky, thorny path, God even protected their
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:46.080]   sandals Deuteronomy 29.5 says that these crudely fashioned sandals, not hiking boots, sandals
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.960]   did not wear out.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.320]   I have led you 40 years in the wilderness.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.680]   Your clothes have not worn out on you and your sandal has not worn out on your feet.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.280]   God was near.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.820]   He was with them.
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:04.760]   He was divinely and miraculously preserving them even to supernaturally protecting their
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:10.400]   clothes, supernaturally protecting their shoes and their feet, but they were too busy grumbling
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:14.360]   and griping to even notice.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:19.880]   What other God would discipline, love, and preserve in such a way?
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:25.920]   Because remember, 40 years is a long time to put up with a bunch of people.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:34.360]   The wilderness wandering and even sometimes a very difficult application of Yahweh's rod
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.720]   were all for blessing.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.600]   He was loving on them as sons.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:48.720]   And he was and is and always will be both God of the universe and good, good father
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.560]   to the orphans he has adopted.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.480]   So one, the wilderness wandering was on purpose.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:28:01.080]   Two, the wilderness wandering was for testing and the wilderness wandering was for blessed
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.080]   training.
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:08.040]   And the purpose of all of this was to teach us children how to worship him and revere
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:18.360]   him, to trust him and to obey him on purpose for testing and for training.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:23.360]   Are you in the middle of a wilderness wandering season currently?
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:28.760]   If you are, what does God desire from you?
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:33.480]   What is he seeking to teach you?
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.080]   Wilderness wanderings are hard.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:42.040]   It may feel as if there is no end in sight.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:47.880]   No matter how hard you pray, there may not be immediate relief.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:52.960]   And things may get worse before they get any better.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.480]   And in the wilderness wandering that is your life, you may be squeezed again and again
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.360]   and again and again and you're so sick of it.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:08.000]   But remember, wildernesses, they are on purpose.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.680]   They are for testing and humbling.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:16.120]   They are for your training to grow you in your faith and to grow you in reflecting his
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.120]   glory.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.440]   They are for blessing.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:25.480]   They are for good and/or for your good.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:32.840]   Most of you guys know this, but for those of you who are newer to our church, I'll
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.880]   briefly share.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:41.560]   This Friday I'm going to be going in for surgery to have 10 inches of my colon and
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:45.120]   parts of my rectum permanently removed.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:50.440]   I was diagnosed in December of last year with stage 3C colorectal cancer.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.840]   And there was a disgusting, if you want to see it I'll show you, okay?
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:57.200]   There was a disgusting six, I actually texted that to the leaders and they're like, "You
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.200]   got to warn us first."
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.840]   Anyway, six centimeters.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:05.900]   It was a disgusting six centimeter long tumor in my colon.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:12.680]   And starting in January, I've done six months of chemotherapy with some very strong drugs
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.000]   I found out later.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.560]   Six weeks of radiation.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:21.760]   And the final step in my cancer treatment is this Friday.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.480]   And so, and for you guys who have been praying for me and my family, we do have some good
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.200]   news.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.920]   The cancer is gone.
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.920]   It's like gone.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.960]   So there's a little divot in my colon where it used to be, but it's gone.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:40.560]   MRI and all the scopes show that it is gone.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.400]   But I'll have the surgery to remove the area where the six centimeter tumor and the enlarged
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:49.120]   lymph nodes were, mainly to prevent the cancer from coming back.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:52.160]   So I stand before you today cancer free.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:58.160]   And a lot of that I'm assuming is you guys have loved on us and prayed for us and sent
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.400]   us lots of food.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:04.520]   So praise God.
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:09.080]   But I don't praise God because I'm cancer free.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:20.560]   I praise him because he is worthy of my praise.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:27.200]   I praised him when I first got diagnosed, when I didn't know how my body would respond
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.520]   to the treatments.
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.520]   First service I was totally fine.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.520]   I don't know what's going on right now.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.520]   I think it's the video.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.520]   Whew.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.520]   Okay.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.520]   God ordained for the effect.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.520]   I'm cancer free.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:41.160]   I praised him when I first got diagnosed, when I didn't know how my body would respond
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.600]   to the treatments.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.280]   I've been praising him for the last 10 months of treatment.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:52.120]   I praised him on the days when the treatments were hard.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:32:00.240]   And I praised him on the days I felt so good, I forgot and you forgot that I had cancer.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:06.640]   And I would like to think that I will praise him in the event the cancer comes back.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.240]   Because if God purposely ordains it, it will come back.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:18.400]   And if it does, if he ordains, it will be for my good and for the good of this church,
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.640]   for the good of the family.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.760]   God is good.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.840]   God is love.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.940]   So like I said, I got diagnosed in December of last year.
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:31.860]   And there are two things that I still have not done.
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.960]   Two things that I likely will not continue to do.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:40.640]   One, I have not once prayed for my healing from this cancer.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.640]   Not once.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.680]   I haven't asked for it.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:49.320]   Though I know many of you guys have prayed for it the past 10 months.
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.800]   God loves me and knows me.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.760]   And he is able to cure all of this at a word.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:56.760]   Be gone.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:57.760]   Gone.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.760]   Gone.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.720]   I trust him.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:07.960]   I don't need to pray for the God who loves me more than I love my children for healing.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:12.960]   I mean, it's biblically prescribed for you to pray for healing, but so don't get me
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:13.960]   wrong.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:14.960]   So keep praying.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.960]   All right?
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.800]   Do it in my stead.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:24.840]   The second thing I haven't done is I have not once asked why.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.360]   I don't need to know why.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:32.320]   I don't need to know the why of this disease.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.980]   Why is for the unregenerate man.
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:43.280]   The regenerate man trusts fully in the one who in his power and mercy has regenerated
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.540]   him.
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:50.820]   I don't need my why questions answered because I trust that he is good.
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.760]   The cancer was on purpose and it was for good.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:34:00.800]   It was used to humble me, to remind me of my mortality, which is always a good thing.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:07.220]   It humbled me and exposed areas of pride, selfish ambition, selfishness, and doubt.
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:12.720]   It moved me to cherish my relationships and to cherish my time and my opportunities.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.860]   It sharpened my resolve.
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.180]   It empowered my testimony.
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:20.240]   And I believe it's grown me as a pastor.
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.640]   And through all of this, what were evidences of God's grace?
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:28.600]   What were my miraculously preserved garment or sandals?
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.360]   I did not throw up once.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.800]   I lost almost no hair.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.800]   I lost almost no weight.
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:47.120]   I worked and ministered through chemo, through radiation, in the midst of a strange pandemic.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:53.600]   God gave me favor with all my doctors, my radiologist, who I got randomly assigned to
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:59.840]   just happened to be my high school friend's older sister, who actually was concerned,
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:05.440]   prayed, and she's a Christian, and designed a treatment as if she were treating her own
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.440]   brother.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:13.440]   A whole bunch of my nurses just happened to be Christians.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.480]   My cancer was on purpose.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:21.600]   And praise the Lord for ordaining it for good and for my good.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:30.320]   Cancer was a very short, but a very real mini-wanderlust for me and my family.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.320]   The wilderness wandering for the people of Israel was on purpose.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.400]   The wilderness wandering was for testing.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.840]   The wilderness wandering was for training.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.520]   And I told you in the beginning that there would be a fourth point.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:46.760]   And here is the fourth lesson we learned from Deuteronomy 8.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:55.000]   It's this, the wilderness was not and will never be home.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.360]   The wilderness was not and will never be home.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.600]   Let me read verses 6 and 7 for you.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:07.560]   "Therefore, you shall keep the commandments of the Lord your God, to walk in his ways,
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.560]   and to fear him.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:14.280]   For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.960]   fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills."
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.080]   "Therefore, you shall keep."
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.880]   So "therefore" is an important word in an inductive Bible study.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:28.760]   So you always want to ask, what is this "therefore, therefore"?
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:34.000]   It connects what has just been said to an expected and appropriate application.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.760]   So in reflecting on this wilderness wandering, Moses was saying, "Hey, God is sovereign.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.780]   God was humbling you.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.520]   God loves you as a father loves his son.
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:55.960]   Therefore, trust and obey, because sooner than later, you're going to go home.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:00.840]   You're going to go to the home that the Lord has promised your forefathers.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:05.560]   The Lord your God is bringing you into a good land."
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.560]   It says in verse 7.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:14.900]   The New Testament believer hears a similar promise from the Lord in John 14.
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:17.900]   Verse 1, "Do not let your heart be troubled.
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.260]   Believe in God.
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:20.260]   Believe also in me."
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.780]   Later in verse 15, what does it say?
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.660]   "If you love me, you will do what?
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.180]   Obey my commandments."
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.180]   Okay?
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.420]   So "do not let your hearts be troubled.
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:28.420]   Believe in God.
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.420]   Believe also in me."
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:33.820]   Verse 2, "In my Father's house are many dwelling places, and if it were not so, I would have
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:34.820]   told you.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.780]   For I go to prepare a place for you.
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:42.420]   If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself, that
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:47.300]   where I am, there you may be also."
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:51.740]   And there are two aspects of these verses in John 14 that not only encourage me, but
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:57.780]   cause me to persevere whenever a wilderness happens upon my way.
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:03.180]   One, Jesus Christ is going to return to take us home.
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:08.060]   C.S. Lewis once said, "The Son of God became a man to enable men to be sons of God."
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:14.880]   So he's coming to take us home, where there are many, many, many, many rooms.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:26.360]   And secondly, my Savior is familiar with both the physical and the spiritual wilderness.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:32.760]   So I can and will believe in God, and I can and I will also believe in Jesus Christ, my
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:37.000]   Savior, and because of these things, my heart will not be troubled.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:44.200]   I want to turn your attention to Matthew 4, verse 1.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:51.680]   "Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil."
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.040]   Who led Jesus into the wilderness?
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.520]   God, the Holy Spirit did.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.080]   The wilderness was on purpose.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:06.080]   "Two, and after he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he then became hungry."
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.640]   I always chuckle when I read this because it took forty days and forty nights to become
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.640]   hungry?
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.640]   I would have been hungry after forty minutes, okay?
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:16.800]   "And the tempter came and said to him, 'If you are the Son of God, command that these
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.640]   stones become bread.'"
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.040]   So what happened to Jesus in the wilderness?
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.120]   He was physically humbled and hungry.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.480]   He was tested.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:29.240]   The wilderness was for testing.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.040]   But Jesus obeyed and passed this test.
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.040]   Hebrews 5, verse 8.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:38.200]   "Although he was the Son of God, he learned obedience from what he himself suffered."
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.040]   So Jesus is the Son of God.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.520]   He was trained through what he suffered.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.320]   The wilderness was for training.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.920]   And then we see Jesus quoting Deuteronomy 8, verse 3, "to the devil.
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.640]   But he answered and said, 'It is written, 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:00.120]   every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.'"
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.600]   Christ's wilderness was on purpose.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:05.120]   Christ's wilderness was for testing.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.000]   Christ's wilderness was for training.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.120]   He just never wandered in it.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:19.040]   And the wilderness was and never will be, was not and never will be, his home.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:24.880]   So in the little wildernesses in our lives, and with the macro wilderness, which is our
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:30.080]   life, what does God desire?
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:33.560]   What does he desire from you and me?
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:39.520]   Well, the obvious answer, "To worship him in spirit and in truth," John 4, 24.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.360]   He desires for us to trust and obey.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.160]   What does Proverbs 3, 5, and 6 say?
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.200]   And you guys, many of you have memorized it.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.360]   "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:41:00.400]   In all your ways, acknowledge/worship him, and he will make your path not easy, he'll
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.400]   make it straight."
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.120]   Proper, appropriate, right.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:07.280]   He'll make it straight.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:12.680]   I want to close with one encouragement for those of you who feel like in the midst of
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:17.520]   your wilderness, in the midst of every squeeze that you're failing.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:21.040]   I'm not going to have you raise your hand, but there are seasons where you feel like
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:25.600]   every test you're failing and falling on your face.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:29.080]   I also want to encourage those of you who are feeling humbled because you're realizing
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:36.000]   more and more, no matter how hard you try, you cannot be holier.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.600]   You are rotten to the core, and sometimes that's a very sobering and very saddening
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.280]   discovery.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:50.160]   The earthly consequences of your sins are already weighing you down, and you're feeling
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:55.480]   the venom of the spiritual serpents in your life.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.560]   I want to encourage you.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:04.880]   Numbers 21, we read the account of the Israelites grumbling yet again, and God sends this time
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:10.520]   fiery serpents to bite them, and many of them repent.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:17.840]   God tells Moses to fashion a bronze serpent, place it on a staff, hoist it up, and those
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:26.520]   who want to be healed and spared need only to look at the bronze serpent.
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:32.000]   That was one of the many demonstrations of God's mercy in the wilderness.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:39.320]   Through it, through the serpent's visual representation of their curse, the Israelites learned an
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.640]   important lesson.
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.160]   Look to live.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.400]   Look and live.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:54.080]   For you guys who are feeling bedraggled, who are weary and heavy laden, who need hope,
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:59.480]   who need some strength to persevere, here is the encouragement.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:06.180]   Isaiah 30.18 says, "The Lord longs to be gracious to you."
[00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:08.800]   Look to Christ.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.120]   Look up.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:19.160]   Lift up your eyes to the only one who can and who is more than willing to save.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:25.560]   John 3.16 reflects on this wilderness episode.
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:33.100]   As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so the Son of Man must be lifted up,
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:38.200]   so that whoever believes in him will have eternal life.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:45.240]   For God, kutos, in this way, for God in this way loved the world, so that he gave his only
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:53.080]   begotten Son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:44:00.120]   Believe in Jesus, the Messiah of God, and then in whatever wilderness the Lord ordained,
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:06.280]   big or small, long or short, trust and obey.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:10.840]   Trust and obey, for there's no other way to be what?
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.880]   To have life.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:21.280]   To have zoway, life to the full.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:26.480]   You cannot save yourself.
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:33.760]   Praise God that he is more than willing to save, and praise God that he is leading us
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:39.320]   through every and any wilderness that we face.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.240]   Amen?
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:47.160]   Not because we are good, not because we are able to obey, but because he is good.
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.280]   And he did obey.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:53.320]   He was the perfect spotless lamb of God.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:56.120]   He is good.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:59.360]   Wilderness tests are on purpose.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:04.640]   They are for testing, they are for training, but he will not leave us there.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:11.920]   They will end, and we will be in glory at home with the Lord forever and ever and ever.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.920]   What a glorious hope Christians have.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:19.680]   No matter what election results, no matter what political environments, no matter what
[00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:28.520]   kind of persecution, oppression, and strife we experience, he is coming back, and he will
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:31.480]   take us home.
