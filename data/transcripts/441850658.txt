[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.200]   - Hi everyone, my name is Angel and I'm a recent graduate from UC Irvine.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.800]   Growing up until this day, neither my parents nor any of my family members are Christian.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.560]   I first learned about God through a church summer camp my mom enrolled me in during the
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.680]   summer before second grade.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.920]   Because she heard a lot of good things about the camp from family friends, she disregarded
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.120]   that the camp was a Christian camp.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.440]   I ended up attending this camp for three years, but it was nothing more to me than just a
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.680]   place where I got to sing and dance to songs, learn cool stories from the Bible, go on field
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.400]   trips and hang out with my friends.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.240]   There's no personal relationship with God or any desire to learn more about him because
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.080]   I grew up with my parents' mentality that there's no need for God to depend on if we're
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.880]   able to live a comfortable life based on hard work.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.240]   So although it was a blessing to be able to grow up comfortably, that comfort had also
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.600]   blinded and hindered me from seeing myself as a sinner in need of a savior.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.680]   Before I received Christ, I was self-sufficient and heavily relied on my own efforts and works
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.400]   to make myself and others see that I was a good person.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.720]   Externally, I used things like good grades, good relationships with my peers, volunteering,
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.960]   and all sorts of reasons to justify why I was a good person.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.840]   Even though these things are good things, it didn't mean that I was a good person just
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.840]   because I did them.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.200]   Internally, it was just a facade masking the ulterior motives in my heart to puff up my
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.200]   ego and pride.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.120]   My pride from thinking that I was self-sufficient led me to also think that, as long as I carefully
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.040]   find out my own life and followed it, then I'd be able to be successful and have a life
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.600]   free from anxieties and uncertainties.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.080]   God opened my eyes and revealed to me my own sinfulness when I was invited to be a camp
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.160]   counselor in 2014 at the same church camp I attended when I was younger.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.720]   This summer was when I clearly understood the gospel for the first time as not just
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.720]   good news for people who were sinners because they did bad things, but as good news for
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.840]   everyone because everyone is a sinner that's in need of God.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.680]   As Romans 3:23 states, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.480]   The gospel message was no longer just another Bible story I heard when I was younger, but
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.120]   it was something that was personal to me and showed me that there was truly nothing I could
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.920]   do on my own accord to attain salvation.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.000]   That was the states in Ephesians 2:9, "For by grace you have been saved through faith,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.440]   and that is not your own doing; it is the gift of God."
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.800]   And also in 1 Peter 1:3, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.960]   According to His great mercy, He has caused us to be born again to a living hope through
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.840]   the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.120]   It is only in the surrender of my will to the Lord and my trust placed in His sovereignty
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.800]   that I can find peace and comfort, not in my own efforts and works.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.440]   As I continue to learn more about the fullness of Christ, I recognize how often I fall short
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.960]   from His perfection, but continually diving deeper into the Word has allowed me to cultivate
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.720]   a greater understanding of what it looks like to live a life according to the Spirit that
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.680]   magnifies the gospel and pleases the Lord.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.880]   I was very blessed to have been able to be a member at Breen throughout my four years
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.800]   of college and to have been surrounded by believers who continually strive to live gospel
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.600]   and scripture-centered lives.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.160]   As grown in my love for the Lord, I must also continue to obey and hold the authority of
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.960]   His Word highly in all areas of my life.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.000]   I was initially sprinkled in a Lutheran church when I became a believer back in high school,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.960]   but after searching through scripture with a desire to obey Christ in all areas of my
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.800]   life, I want to practice the act of baptism through immersion, the manner that God had
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.480]   intended to instruct the believers through His Word and for the sake of full righteousness."
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.480]   Thank you.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:37.480]   [applause]
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:52.480]   [speaking in tongues]
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.480]   [laughter]
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.480]   [applause]
