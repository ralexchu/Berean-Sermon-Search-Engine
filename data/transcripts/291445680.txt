[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Turn to Leviticus chapter 22.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:33.880]   All right, let me pray for us and we'll jump right in.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.880]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you again for just the privilege that we have to be
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.760]   able to come and study your word together.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.080]   We know that there are parts of scripture, especially in Leviticus, that are difficult
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.880]   to understand.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.840]   Help us not to shy away from digging, asking, and even if we don't get the answers that
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.920]   we want and hoping for, help us, Lord God, that in our pursuit that we would get a greater
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.960]   glimpse of who you are and that we would come closer and closer, Lord God, each week to
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.980]   understanding your heart and your desire.
[00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.880]   Help us to have a greater understanding of the gospel, what you have done, and all of
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.880]   this, Lord, prepare for the coming of Christ and what he has done for us.
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.320]   Help us, Lord God, as we have a deeper understanding of your mercies, that it would have a deep
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.200]   effect on our thoughts, our worship, our singing, our giving.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.400]   Our very lives, Lord God, may truly be offered up to you as a living sacrifice.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.520]   So we pray for your blessing this afternoon, this evening.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.880]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.820]   All right, so we're looking at Leviticus chapter 22.
[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.000]   Chapter 21 and 22, you probably already noticed that in your outline it belongs together.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.740]   So chapter 21 was about the regulations on who can and cannot be priests, what kind of
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.100]   defects or whatever impurities that the priest would have and that would disqualify him.
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:04.260]   In chapter 22, we get to the talking about who are able to handle and eat and participate
[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:12.040]   in the meals that were, or the meats that were sacrificed to the tabernacle.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.340]   So really in outline, it really belongs together.
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.260]   But I want to jump in, so I want to give you enough time with as small a group as possible.
[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.340]   The first part of it, verse 1 to 3, starts as an introduction and basically the outline
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.380]   is that no impure priest may present a sacred offering, that he's not able to touch it,
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.600]   he's not able to participate in it.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.940]   Just as a quick, broad overview, the book of Leviticus is an instructional manual on
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.300]   how to worship God.
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.980]   So back in seminary, we had to take classes, depending on which seminary you go to, they
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.380]   have different classes on this, but the theology of worship.
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.100]   And depending on which tradition you come from, whether you're Baptist or Presbyterian
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.740]   or whatever background, there's long history and theology behind why they do what they
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.740]   do.
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.500]   So if you grew up in a Presbyterian church or a Methodist church, you'll notice that
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.940]   the pulpit is usually on the side.
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.980]   The middle, there's a kind of an altar where they do communion and then you have on the
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.820]   left side, typically, you have on the left side, you have where the presider comes and
[00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.940]   gives announcements and maybe a prayer and then the pastor typically gives his message
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.620]   on the right side, the pulpit that's standing on the right, because the philosophy behind
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.580]   it is that at the center is the altar.
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.600]   And so that's where the communion takes place and everything else takes place on the side.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.820]   If you go to a typical Baptist church, you'll find that the pulpit is in the middle.
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.180]   And the theology or the philosophy behind that is that the foundation of the church
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.760]   is God's word.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.060]   So behind everything that we do, we want the word of God to be centered.
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.200]   So if you typically go to a non-denominational church, you'll see a pulpit in the middle.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.660]   If you go to a traditional Presbyterian church, I've noticed that more and more Presbyterian
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.420]   churches are kind of bringing the pulpit to the middle because of a call to make the Bible
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.420]   central.
[00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.700]   But again, if you go to a traditional Presbyterian Methodist church, you'll see it on the side.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.860]   Now all of this to say that the book of Leviticus really was meant for the Jewish community
[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.740]   an instructional manual on how to worship God, because that's what the tabernacle ultimately
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.740]   is.
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.420]   We're talking about giving sacrifices and different kinds of offerings and all of that
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:37.740]   is a manual as to how a sinful people can approach a holy God for the purpose of worship.
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.220]   And so everything that we're learning here are instructions on how to approach this holy
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.860]   God.
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.580]   The Lord made sure that no one ever approached Him in a casual manner.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.140]   So He didn't just give general instructions and say, "Make sure that you're clean.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.140]   Make sure you do this.
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.900]   Make sure you do it on the Sabbath."
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.740]   He gave specific instruction.
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.340]   And remember what happened in Leviticus chapter 10?
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:24.500]   The very first offering that was given, it just says, "There was a sense of seriousness."
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.460]   Sense of seriousness.
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.620]   That's the puzzle.
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.860]   Sense of seriousness.
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.740]   And again, every part of the book of Leviticus was to instill in the people when they were
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.580]   approaching God to take it very serious.
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.180]   In fact, the word for glory literally means to be weighty.
[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.740]   That's a literal understanding of the word glory, is to be weighty.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.040]   Something heavy.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.900]   So everything about approaching the glory of God was meant to instill something very
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.940]   heavy.
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.420]   So you were never to casually approach the throne of God.
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.420]   But just kind of walk in.
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.940]   You know, you've just played BBA and then you just wiped off sweat and you just kind
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.500]   of walked into the tabernacle.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.260]   That never happened.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.540]   And God did that deliberately so that when it was your time to go to the tabernacle to
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.740]   make the sacrifices, there was plenty of preparation that took place to examine yourself, examine
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.460]   the animal, examine to see what you came in touch with, what kind of clothes you wore.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.660]   Everything you did, you had to be thoughtful and careful because if you went in there nonchalantly
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.780]   and you didn't follow instructions, there was sometimes capital punishment.
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:44.820]   So everything about worship was to instill a sense of heaviness that you're approaching
[00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.640]   the holy, holy, holy God.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.640]   And that's why all of these instructions that are given, even though it may be tedious and
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:59.100]   difficult to understand, the overarching theme behind it is don't come to God nonchalantly.
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.100]   Make sure you're prepared.
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.980]   Make sure you're thinking thoroughly.
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:10.420]   Verses four to nine, no impure priest may eat of the sacred offering.
[00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:16.180]   Chapter 21, again, as I mentioned earlier, was dealt with who was able to serve as a
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.220]   priest.
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.460]   Those who did not qualify were still able to eat of the sacrifice food.
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.700]   According to chapter 21, 22.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.460]   But chapter 22 gives guidelines as to who can and cannot participate in eating of the
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.460]   food.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.700]   So that's basically the outline of the rest of the chapter.
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.060]   Chapter four through chapter 22, verse four through 30.
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:41.460]   Who can, who cannot participate in this.
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.580]   A broad outline.
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:49.940]   Holiness in the book of Leviticus is symbolized with wholeness.
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:55.100]   So we've already gone through maybe about six or seven different lists up to this point
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:08:02.380]   of what kind of defects disqualify the priest, what kind of defects disqualify the animal.
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:07.500]   And so again, the overarching teaching is that whatever you bring to God, whether it
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.900]   is the person representing the people or the animal sacrifice itself, it had to be perfect
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.340]   without defect.
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:19.400]   So holiness is symbolized through wholeness.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.000]   And that's what he's describing.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.540]   So I'm not going to go through every single one of these, but no man is to come if he's
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:32.400]   a no man who is a leopard is allowed to touch the sacrifices.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.560]   No man who has a discharge and now none of these things are new to chapter 22.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.680]   It's all been mentioned previously, but it just kind of, he just kind of rapid fire.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:47.320]   No man who touches anything unclean by a corpse, no man who has seminal emission and no man
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.400]   who touches any teaming or crawling things.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:58.240]   So all of these things would cause the man to be defected and to be unclean.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.400]   Now we talked about this last week, that all of this ultimately is not to say that if you
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.000]   have leprosy, that somehow you're a greater sinner than somebody who doesn't have leprosy,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.200]   or if you had certain kind of discharge or somehow you came in contact with, with a dead
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.440]   animal or human being that you became defiled and you became a greater sinner than somebody
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.440]   else.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.440]   Right?
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.440]   We already talked about that last week.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.840]   This, if this doesn't mean that you are a greater sinner because you have these things,
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.840]   right?
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:33.120]   Every part of this is a shadow of the reality that was coming in Christ.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.840]   So when it says that anything that is not completely pure cannot be in the presence
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:44.400]   of God, all of this is to point to what was going to happen in Christ.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:50.760]   If you became unclean and it was something that you were able to rectify, he says in
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:56.960]   verse 6 and 7 that you are to go through a ritual bathing, then he will be considered
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.120]   clean when the sun sets.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:07.560]   And again, all of this is mentioned in the previous chapters and he's just reiterating.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:14.080]   No man shall eat any animal that dies or is torn by wild animals.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.000]   Only meat that is sacrificed officially to the Lord.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.320]   An animal that may have been killed is lying on the street and may be perfectly edible.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.880]   It hasn't rotted, maybe it just happened.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.680]   But purpose of doing that is to make sure that whatever sacrifice that is given to the
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.920]   Lord, that it was intentional.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.200]   It was not just something worthless that was picked up and then you just threw it on the
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.760]   altar to kind of, you know, to satisfy God.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:45.040]   He says God, the sacrifice that we offer up to God ought to be intentional.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:51.160]   And then he says if any priest profanes the sacrifice of God, his penalty is death.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:11:00.800]   Again, for the priest, so imagine if you're a priest and if you violate any of these things,
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.920]   just like Neydevin and Nebiu, it wasn't just a slap on the hand saying, okay, you're going
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.920]   to get punished, time out for a month and you can't serve.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:14.320]   He says if the people who are representing God, these priests, and a greater consequence
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:20.360]   for the high priest, if you come before the Lord nonchalantly without taking seriously
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:25.600]   the position that he's in, he says that the penalty is death.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:33.240]   So imagine what was going through the mind of a priest every time he came to the altar.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:40.320]   I mean, I could imagine that the priest, that even if you had only one hour of sleep, if
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.760]   you were approaching the altar, that nobody fell asleep on duty.
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.940]   That's my guess, right?
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.280]   My guess is nobody came into the tent nonchalantly, nobody touched the animal nonchalantly.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.320]   There was a sense of seriousness, right?
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.400]   Because they understood the consequence.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.120]   Just like if you're going into an operating room, right, having open heart surgery, you
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.000]   don't just go in there with dirty hands.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.480]   You don't walk in there because any little taint, anything that happened, you don't chew
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.240]   gum and then drop spit into an open cavity.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.020]   You don't go in there nonchalantly.
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.520]   Everything has to be scrubbed, it has to be sterile.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.880]   Everybody needs to be on top of the game.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.480]   So if the surgeon says, "Give me this," they have to jump and give it to you right away.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:30.880]   I mean, everybody is supposed to be on high alert when they're in that room.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.680]   That's the kind of atmosphere that was created by all these commands.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.280]   Anybody who was in the tabernacle, it was kind of getting into the operating room and
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:43.120]   it's sterile and it's perfect and everything has to be done exactly the way God wanted
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.280]   it to happen, right?
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:51.640]   As tedious as it is, again, because the consequence ultimately was death.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:56.320]   Verses 10-16, "Who may or may not eat of the sacred offering?"
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.000]   And he gives a list of boundaries, right?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.760]   And it's limited to the people who are connected to the priesthood, the Levites.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:10.160]   So one, no one outside of the priest's household could eat of them.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.440]   No sojourners and no hired men.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.520]   The priest did not have the option to say, "You know, we have so many left over, why
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.440]   don't we give it to our neighbors?"
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.960]   Because the sacrifice was considered sacred, the only people who were able to participate
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.440]   in it were the family members.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.480]   No guests were allowed to come, no sojourners, nobody who was hungry.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.320]   It had to be family members.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:37.360]   A slave is given the privilege to eat the offering since he is considered family if
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.880]   his position is permanent.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:47.480]   In other words, again, our idea of slavery, at least because of the evils that we've seen
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.880]   in modern history, but a lot of the things that there were then, if you could have been
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:59.740]   a good master, and maybe for financial reasons to help that family, he said if the person
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:04.520]   was purchased to be a slave, he was treated like a family member and he was allowed to
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.600]   participate in this meal.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.480]   Because if they didn't, there was no other way for them to eat.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.960]   So slaves were considered within that family where they were able to handle the sacred
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.360]   thing or eat of it.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.020]   If the priest's daughter is married to a layman, she will be disqualified to eat of it because
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.560]   she is now connected to a new family.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:30.040]   So she no longer is able to be connected and to eat of the sacred food.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.760]   A daughter who is widowed or divorced may eat of the father's food.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.960]   Again, because of their widowhood and divorce, they had no other place where they can be
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:47.440]   connected so God allowed them to be able to participate in the sacred meal.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:53.400]   If the holy gift is eaten unintentionally, he must follow the requirements given in the
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.920]   sin offering by adding a fifth to the cost of the holy gift that was consumed to the
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.920]   priest.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.480]   Again, this is all mentioned in chapter 515.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:06.120]   Sin offering, or another word for it is reparation offering.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:10.180]   When you taint the offering and as a result of that you have to pay them back, you pay
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:14.080]   them back and you're supposed to give one fifth back to them.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.800]   So it said if you eat of it unintentionally and you defile it, you're supposed to pay
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.880]   it back.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:26.380]   Then finally, they must not treat the sacred offering as everyday items by allowing lay
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.600]   people of Israel to eat them.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:35.800]   And to disrespect the sacred offering was to disrespect God himself, verse 15 and 16.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:41.240]   Repeatedly, over and over again, it is emphasized.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:49.960]   If you disrespect the sacred, anything that is sacred to God, God took it as you are disrespecting
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.520]   me.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.680]   Remember why David, he would not slay King Saul?
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.120]   Even though he had an opportunity, even though Saul was just committed to get rid of David,
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.680]   remember what David said?
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:08.400]   Because Saul was an anointed of God, because he was anointed from God, he was afraid that
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.320]   he was disrespecting God by disrespecting his anointed.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.000]   Even though Saul was trying to kill him.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.560]   David understood this because this was embedded into Israel's history, Israel's day to day
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.680]   life.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:31.460]   Anything that was set apart for God was to be considered belonging to God.
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.720]   So in this way, God took care of the Levites.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:39.220]   The Levites were not given a piece of land.
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:44.420]   So if you, some of you guys who may, I'm assuming most of you are probably hazy with the book
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.680]   of Numbers, but the book of Numbers is about inheritance.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:53.120]   You entered into the wandering of the desert with 600,000 men, and then they walk out with
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.120]   600,000 men.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:58.820]   But each of the tribes, they grow or they decrease depending upon their faithfulness
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.000]   in the 40 years of wandering in the desert.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.760]   So when they finally get into the promised land, based upon the number of people in your
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.540]   tribe, they gave them a piece of land.
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:14.720]   So it was divided into various pieces of land, but the Levites did not get any.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.180]   Levites got pieces of land within the large pieces of land.
[00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.940]   So they didn't have an inheritance in land.
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:28.660]   So their inheritance was that whatever was given to the temple, the tent, the grain offering,
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.940]   the sacrifices, that was their portion.
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:36.900]   And so God basically said that whatever is coming in, because that's the only portion
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.240]   that they have, this is dedicated for them.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.120]   And so in that way, God took care of them.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:48.180]   So when Jesus says in Matthew 6, 31 to 34, that idea of "Seek ye first the kingdom of
[00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:54.140]   God and all these things shall be added unto you," really was embedded before Jesus said
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.140]   that.
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.140]   Right?
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.740]   So we're talking about the Levites, that because they were dedicated for the Lord's
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.020]   service, the Lord will take care of their family.
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.020]   Right?
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:16.020]   At least it's not a direct connection, but the idea is embedded into what we see here.
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:22.500]   Proper animals for sacrifices, chapter 22, 17 through 25.
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:29.220]   The first thing that he mentions, the votive or the vow offering and freewill offering,
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:34.160]   which sometimes we call it the fellowship offering, given as a burnt offering must be
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.900]   a male, cattle, sheep, or goat without defect.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:43.000]   Again, none of this is new to you because this was all mentioned before, but when you
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.580]   choose to give this offering, give the burnt offering as a freewill or a vow offering.
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:59.340]   It has to follow the stipulations and the commandments given in the earlier chapters.
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:04.460]   Those that are blind or fractured or maimed or having a running sore, eczema, or scabs
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.140]   will not be accepted as a sacrifice to the Lord.
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:14.700]   Again, the sacrifice, not only the priest, but the sacrifice itself has to be without
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.180]   defect.
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.260]   But he does give one condition.
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:27.000]   For a freewill offering, an ox or a lamb with overgrown or stunted members will be accepted.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:35.540]   Only a freewill offering, God accepts a defected animal, but not for a vow offering.
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.180]   Why do you think that is?
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:53.880]   Why does God give room for a defected animal for the freewill offering?
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.740]   Every other offering was mandatory.
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.180]   It was for the purpose of rectifying a sin.
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.700]   A freewill offering was out of thanksgiving, right?
[00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:08.860]   And so God wanted to give from the abundance of your heart, so God gave room.
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.100]   Give what you can.
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:16.340]   So only in the freewill offering, God gave permission to give a defected animal, but
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:23.140]   everything else had to be exactly what God told him, without defect.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:28.020]   Any animal with crushed testicles are considered corrupt and with defect and will not be accepted
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:31.640]   before the Lord.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:40.580]   You probably will never read that phrase anywhere else, maybe in your life, or maybe if you
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.740]   go into, you're going to be a veterinarian or something.
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.740]   I don't know where you would ever hear this.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:51.740]   Maybe go to the medical field, like those of you in the medical field, do you read this
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.740]   somewhere?
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.940]   Like how to treat people with crushed testicles?
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:01.340]   I mean, you probably, this statement, you probably only hear it in the book of Leviticus,
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.340]   right?
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.980]   And it's not mentioned once in passing.
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.700]   It's actually pretty significant.
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:14.860]   It's mentioned several times with the priests, with the animals, and it starts and ends sometimes
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:19.140]   highlighting this.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.380]   Why do you think that is?
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:28.620]   And certain other diseases that are emphasized, like leprosy, right?
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:34.740]   Leprosy ultimately pointed to sin and the damage of sin.
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.100]   And he specifically mentions all the things that he could mention.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.140]   It's like, oh, you can't bring an animal with one ear, right?
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.860]   Could have said that.
[00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.780]   Or one nostril bent, right?
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:45.940]   Or four fingers.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:46.940]   I don't know.
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:51.700]   There's so many things that you could have mentioned, but specifically crushed testicles,
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.100]   right?
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:59.820]   Why is that?
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.260]   You read before you came.
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.580]   All right.
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:07.420]   So it's directly connected to when God created Adam and Eve, he's told them to be fruitful
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.780]   and multiply, right?
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:14.460]   So remember the whole holiness is represented in wholeness, right?
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:20.260]   And one of the key qualities of being whole is to be able to carry out what God intended
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.260]   mankind to do.
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:26.900]   And so a human being and an animal, again, all of these are symbolic and shadow of what
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.500]   God will restore in the future, right?
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.380]   So again, just because a man or an animal had crushed testicles doesn't mean that it
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:37.540]   can't be a whole human being, right?
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:44.440]   But basically in the symbolism, in the shadow of the fall of man and not being able to carry
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:50.100]   out what God commanded them to do, that in the end it's highlighted, right?
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.060]   They are not able to be fruitful and multiply.
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:57.020]   So it emphasizes that these animals and these human beings who have these defects cannot
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:02.900]   approach the Lord, right?
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.140]   In Malachi chapter one, seven through eight, Malachi highlights the sin of Israel.
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:12.140]   And he says, "You are presenting defiled food upon my altar, but you say, 'How have we defiled
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:16.300]   you in that you say the table of the Lord is to be despised, but when you present the
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.100]   blind for sacrifice, is it not evil?'"
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.100]   Right?
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.100]   He doesn't say it's a mistake.
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:25.420]   He says, "When you do not follow the command of the Lord, it is considered evil.
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:29.700]   And when you present the lame and the sick, is it not evil?
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.520]   Why not offer it to your governor?
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.700]   Would he be pleased with you or would he receive you kindly, says the Lord of hosts."
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.800]   In other words, you have these defected animals.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.340]   If you're coming to the Lord, right?
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:46.240]   If you're going to a governor, like, would you ever give a defected animal a sacrifice?
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:51.440]   He's going to look at it and, you know, and sees that this is something that is not as
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.960]   worth the best.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.500]   If you're going to the governor's house to present the gift, wouldn't you choose what
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.860]   is best?
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.520]   Why would you not have the same reverence or more when you approach the Lord?
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.880]   Right?
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:08.440]   Think about that, how that translates in the way that we approach God.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.740]   The kind of reverence that we have toward job applications, right?
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.640]   Job interviews, right?
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.760]   Into certain things like, "Oh, I can never be late.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.760]   You know, I have to do this."
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.640]   And you dress up and you make sure everything's great.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.160]   But for whatever the reason, when we come to worshiping God, we have a lax attitude.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.520]   I remember somebody saying, you know, making fun of me because I wear, you know, suits
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:36.400]   on Sunday, you know, especially we live in SoCal, California, where it's just casual,
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.200]   you know, maybe I just like wearing suits.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:43.080]   And again, the Bible doesn't say, "Bear wearing suits makes it more reverent."
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.480]   Right?
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.240]   And so that doesn't mean anything at all.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.440]   It doesn't mean like you can wear a suit and be completely irreverent.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:56.200]   But the general idea of approaching God with reverence, if you're going to, if you are
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.400]   a person who is casual all the time, maybe, right?
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.760]   But in other words, he's saying, if you come to a governor, you would never come to the
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.960]   governor casually.
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.120]   Why do you approach the Lord casually?
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.120]   Right?
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.440]   Now, I'm not applying and therefore saying that you have to wear a suit, you have to
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.120]   do this, you have to do that.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.120]   Okay?
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.120]   That's not what I'm saying.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.240]   But in our attitude, right?
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:25.080]   In the attitude that we have toward worshiping God, we should show a greater reverence toward
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.680]   God than a job interview.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.000]   Right?
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.320]   Everything that he says here, it directly parallels the teachings about the priest.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.320]   Right?
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:44.760]   So chapter 22, it talks about the blind, fractured maim, right?
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:49.800]   The skin disease and scabs and then it ends with crushed testicles.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.160]   Right?
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.160]   So it starts with the blind and then forbids crushed testicles.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:00.080]   Leviticus 21, like these are the qualifications of the priest that he must not be blind or
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.080]   lame.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.080]   Right?
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.720]   And then eczema, scabs and then crushed testicles.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.440]   So it kind of parallels.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:15.200]   So the same defects that disqualifies a priest, it will disqualify the sacrifice itself.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:26.360]   Fifth, the proper procedure for sacrifice for 26 through 30.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:32.520]   The animal must be at least eight days old.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.840]   Let's look at verse 27.
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:39.120]   When an ox or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall remain seven days with its mother and
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.440]   from the eighth day on it shall be accepted as a sacrifice of an offering by fire to the
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.800]   Lord.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:51.640]   Some have argued that maybe this was God's way of showing compassion.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.640]   Right?
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.280]   And I've read that in commentaries and some people think that maybe that's the reason.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.360]   We don't know for sure.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:03.920]   I don't think it was necessary for compassion because giving the mother eight days to nurse
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.840]   the child or whatever you want to call it, right?
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:12.560]   And then to take it away, I would think that that would be even more cruel.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:17.640]   I think the reason why is to make sure that the offering that you're giving to God is
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.800]   an animal that's actually going to live.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.800]   Right?
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:25.920]   Now, today, if the child is born without any kind of defect and health issues, you know,
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.560]   majority of the children will survive.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:32.360]   But a long time ago when there wasn't good medical facilities, you know, and doctors
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:37.360]   around, you know, it was a big deal that the children made it past 100 days.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:38.560]   Right?
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:43.160]   And so in different cultures, and I know in Korean cultures, they have a 100-day celebration
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.800]   because not that long ago, children didn't make it past 100 days.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   Right?
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:53.040]   And so I think that the reason why this is given is to make sure that the sacrifice that
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:57.600]   was going to be given to God wasn't a sacrifice that was going to die anyway.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.600]   Right?
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:05.800]   To nurse the child, that it is a sacrifice that is going to qualify as what God has been
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.960]   saying up to this point.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.020]   Right?
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:15.040]   That is a sacrifice that's going to cost something.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.480]   The animals and its young could not be slaughtered on the same day.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.480]   Right?
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.480]   Verse 28.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:27.320]   "For whether it is an ox or a sheep, you shall not kill both it and its young in one
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.320]   day."
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.800]   There are similar prohibitions that are given in other parts of the Bible.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.280]   It is forbidden to take a bird and its egg together.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.280]   Right?
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:45.560]   In Exodus 23, 19, it says it is forbidden to cook a kid in its mother's milk.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:53.120]   There are other parts of the Bible that kind of mirrors this commandment.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:58.420]   Now again, we're not exactly sure why this was given.
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:03.560]   It seems like to me that there is something sacred between a mother and child.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.560]   Possibly.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.640]   Maybe that's the reason.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:18.480]   But clearly this principle is repeated in other parts of the Bible, in other areas.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.560]   The sacrifice of Thanksgiving must be eaten on the same day and not leave any of it for
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.080]   the morning.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.000]   Because this was not considered just food for you to store up.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.560]   It was a sacred food that was offered to God and you were to rely on God's provision.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.560]   Right?
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.560]   And you were to rely on the sacrifices.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.560]   So if you remember, in the Lord's Prayer, what did he say?
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:43.080]   He said, "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.480]   Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.920]   Give us this day our daily bread."
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.600]   Why does it say daily bread?
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:58.360]   One, it points to the time that Israelites were in the desert, right?
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:03.080]   And then God gave them miraculous food and God told them only pick up the food for that
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.080]   day.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.080]   Right?
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.560]   And anything else that you pick up more than that will be rotten.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.560]   And only on the day before the Sabbath, you are to collect for the Sabbath because you're
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.560]   not supposed to work on that day.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:19.920]   But even before the miraculous manna happened, God told them here.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.920]   Right?
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.960]   Because this tabernacle happened before the 40 days wandering.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.960]   Right?
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.560]   Before they went and entered into the desert.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:36.800]   So the idea of depending upon God for daily sustenance is embedded into their culture.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:41.040]   Because what does he say later on in Hosea?
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.400]   That the primary, one of the primary reasons why Israel kept on drifting away from God
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:51.160]   is when they were fed, they became proud and they what?
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.080]   Forgot God.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.600]   And that was the pattern that you saw in the nation of Israel over and over again.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.640]   When they were desperate, they cried out to God.
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.240]   God answers their prayer.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.240]   God feeds them.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.720]   And then once they get fed and they're comfortable, right?
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.720]   They become proud.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.880]   Hey, look at all this food.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:07.880]   We're good.
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.880]   Then as soon as they're comfortable, they forget God.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:14.720]   And then once they forget God, they begin to drift out into the idols.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.720]   Right?
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:21.660]   So God embedded into the Israelites culture to be dependent upon him.
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:27.100]   That's why Jesus said it is harder for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.500]   than a camel through an eye of a needle.
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:34.380]   Because a rich man is constantly proud that he is good.
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:37.220]   That he's not desperate before God.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.380]   Does that mean that all poor people are desperate for God?
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.180]   Does that mean that all rich people are proud?
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:44.060]   Absolutely not.
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:47.460]   But there's a greater temptation.
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:53.100]   So give us this day our daily bread is not simply limited to the manna in the desert.
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:58.060]   This was actually embedded into God's principle.
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:03.780]   To be dependent upon him.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:10.100]   Concluding remarks in 31-33, two biblical reasons are given as motivation for obedience
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.980]   at the end.
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:22.100]   First, the Lord is their Redeemer who brought them out of Egypt to be their God.
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:27.260]   Verse 31, "So you shall keep my commandments and do them.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.260]   I am the Lord.
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:32.220]   You shall not profane my holy name, but I will be sanctified among the sons of Israel.
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:36.420]   I am the Lord who sanctifies you, who brought you out from the land of Egypt to be your
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:37.420]   God.
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.420]   I am the Lord."
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.940]   So first, he says, "Remember why you're here."
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:44.020]   Every time things got tough, what did they do?
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.100]   They began to grumble.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.300]   They forgot where they were.
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.280]   They were slaves, right?
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.440]   But when things got tough and they started grumbling, they said, "Oh, I remember how
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.580]   Egypt was so great."
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:56.580]   And they forgot.
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:02.700]   And God says, "I want you to obey my commandment because I'm the one who delivered you out
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.060]   of Egypt."
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:11.780]   And I think this principle is so important for us as Christians.
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:17.060]   And this is why in Romans chapter 12, verse 1, it says, "In view of his mercy."
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:23.220]   As soon as his mercy becomes just an afterthought or we become apathetic toward our salvation
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:28.860]   and what he has done, our attitude toward God becomes nonchalant.
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:32.740]   Our desperateness and thankfulness, it disappears because after a while, it just becomes old
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:35.540]   news.
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:42.540]   And that's why it's a constant necessity as Christians to remember.
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:46.060]   Remember what we've been saved from, right?
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.740]   Remember the ugliness of sin.
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:51.420]   Remember the bondage that we were under before we met Christ.
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.820]   And he says, "It's the Lord who delivered us out of Egypt."
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.220]   In other words, so pay attention.
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.860]   Secondly, "The Lord who redeemed us is a holy God.
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.540]   Therefore, Israel must not profane his name."
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:08.260]   I think I have a...
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.380]   Redemption and obedience to the Holy Redeemer go hand in hand.
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:17.060]   So this kind of reminds me, like if you ask a child under a certain age, I don't know,
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:23.540]   I forget exactly when that happens, you know, probably around 11 or 12, you ask them, you
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.820]   know, "Do you love your mommy or daddy?"
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:26.900]   And they'll say, "Yes."
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.980]   And you ask them why and they'll tell you.
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:31.940]   "Because you got me socks.
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.900]   Because you got me yogurt land."
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.260]   And they'll tell you the things that you did for them.
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:40.300]   And they'll say, "That's why I love you, because you did these things."
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:44.580]   If you ask a 19-year-old, you know, "Do you love mommy or daddy?"
[00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:45.580]   You say, "Yes."
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:46.580]   "Why?"
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:47.580]   "Because you bought me a car."
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:48.580]   Right?
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:52.540]   Or, "You got me new shoes."
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.220]   Or, "You paid for something."
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.460]   It won't sound the same.
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.740]   It's not going to say, "Oh, that's so cute.
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.420]   I'm going to keep giving you stuff."
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:07.780]   At some point, you expect love to mature.
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:12.740]   You don't, if somebody in their 20s and 30s saying, "Well, I love you because you bought
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:17.260]   me this and you bought me that," you know, meaning that if you stop giving me this stuff,
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.020]   I don't know if I'm going to keep loving you.
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:24.980]   That's okay as a child, but as you mature, hopefully they'll mature enough to understand
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:28.200]   that you have these things because you have your parents.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.340]   And you love your parents because they're your parents.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.340]   Right?
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.020]   And that's exactly what God is saying.
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.460]   He said, "Remember that I'm the one who delivered you out of Egypt, but the ultimate reason
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.940]   why is because the Lord your God is holy.
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.220]   So therefore, you ought to be holy."
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.220]   Right?
[00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:44.700]   So, both of them are important.
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:49.540]   But at some point, every Christian needs to mature beyond, "What did God do for me?"
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:54.120]   And if a Christian doesn't mature, his affection for Christ is always going up and down based
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.620]   upon what God is doing or not doing.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.620]   Right?
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:02.220]   If he has a good job or not good job, if people are nice to him, if his circumstance is great,
[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.220]   like God is great.
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.940]   If it's not, where is God?
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:10.560]   And he has an infant understanding, an infant relationship with God the rest of his life.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.700]   And so when the Bible says, "Be holy for I am holy," it's never a real motivation for
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.180]   them because, "What have you done for me lately?"
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.180]   Right?
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:23.460]   Ultimately, the reason behind our obedience and wanting to be holy is when God is the
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:34.460]   one who provides, God is the one who delivers, but ultimately it's because he is holy.
[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:39.700]   Christ ultimately is both the perfect priest and the perfect sacrifice.
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:45.820]   As we mentioned last week, that all of this ultimately points to Christ the perfect priest,
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.100]   Christ the perfect sacrifice.
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.100]   Right?
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:56.060]   Hebrews chapter 7, 26, "For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent,
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:37:01.700]   undefiled, separated from sinners, exalted above the heavens."
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:05.300]   Hebrews 9, 14, "How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal spirit
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:12.340]   offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:13.340]   living God."
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.340]   Okay?
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:18.980]   1 Peter 1, 18, 19, "Knowing that you are not redeemed with perishable things like silver
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:23.180]   or gold from your futile way of life, inherited from your forefathers, but with the precious
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:27.340]   blood as a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ."
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:33.540]   So all of this ultimately points to Christ perfect priesthood, Christ perfect sacrifice.
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:34.540]   Right?
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:40.940]   So, a Jew who read these passages would have automatically connected it to the tabernacle.
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.340]   You see why the book of Leviticus is so important?
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:48.340]   There's so much language in the New Testament that if you knew it, when you read it, it
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.260]   has a completely different perspective.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.740]   Because a Jew would have read this and automatically connected to everything that they were doing
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:58.780]   for hundreds and hundreds of years.
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.220]   And then they may have said, "Well, God told us to do this."
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:06.820]   And can you imagine having done this for generation to generation to generation, having it embedded
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:12.440]   into your culture, and it didn't make full sense until Christ came?
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:19.240]   And then when this revelation started to really unfold, you start realizing, "That's why
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:22.440]   he told us to do that."
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.300]   That's why he needed to be without defect.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.680]   That's why the priest had to be perfect.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.640]   That's why they had to be clothed in this way.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:34.080]   So everything that was a shadow, all of a sudden, they came out from behind the curtain
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:35.520]   and say, "This is who I am."
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.320]   That's exactly what it says, Hebrews chapter one.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:43.840]   Christ is a radiance of God's glory, exact representation of who God is.
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.760]   All of this ultimately fulfilled in Christ.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:54.880]   Finally, his perfect priesthood and his perfect sacrifice was to redeem for himself a perfect
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:55.880]   church.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:03.400]   As it states in Ephesians 5, 25-27, "Husband, love your wife just as Christ loved the church
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:08.000]   and gave himself up for her so that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.280]   of water with the word, that he might present to himself a church in all her glory, having
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:20.120]   no spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she would be holy and blameless."
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:27.520]   So again, the whole point of this tabernacle and all these tedious requirements and weightiness
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:34.220]   and without blemish, without defect, all of it, so that Christ's perfect priesthood would
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:44.720]   give Christ perfect sacrifice to establish Christ's perfect church, covered by his blood.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:50.440]   So again, as we wrap up for this evening, I'm going to give you time to have time for
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.440]   discussion.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.560]   What do we learn from this?
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.920]   Because all of this was embedded.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:02.320]   So clearly it's fulfilled in Christ, but imagine what this did to the nation of Israel.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.000]   What kind of mindset did they have when they approached God?
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.840]   How did they look at sacrifices they offered up to God?
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.840]   What kind of teaching did they give to the priesthood, anybody who represented God?
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:17.680]   And how does that translate into how we ought to view God and the things of God today?
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:21.760]   So the three questions, do you think your attitude toward worshipping God is done in
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:22.760]   reverence?
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:26.720]   What does that look like on Sunday and in private worship?
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.680]   Number two, 2 Timothy 2.20-21 says that, "In a large house there are items that are honorable
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:36.520]   and dishonorable, and that we ought to rid our lives of dishonorable things to be prepared
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.720]   for God's use."
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:41.200]   What is the first thing you think of when you think of what is dishonorable in your
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.280]   life?
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:48.720]   So I'm not asking you guys to take all night to talk about every little dishonorable thing,
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.680]   and it doesn't necessarily have to be something external.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.680]   It could be internal.
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.680]   But what's the first thing?
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:58.580]   What's the biggest thing that you think of when you think of dishonorable?
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:02.160]   And what way are you making an effort to purge yourself from that?
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:08.400]   Three, if Jesus died to make us perfect worshipper, why do we still experience so much struggle
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.460]   with our flesh?
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.480]   What does Christian perfection look like in the Bible?
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:18.320]   When I say Christian perfection, I'm not talking about like somehow after we become Christian,
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.280]   we have the ability to be absolutely perfect.
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.320]   God calls us holy, right?
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.640]   God says His church is without blemish, without a spot.
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:31.440]   And why do we have so much struggle?
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:35.720]   Is it simply being forgiven to do whatever we want, or does God actually command and
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.320]   expect the church to practice holiness in our lives?
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.320]   Explain your answers with Scripture if possible.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.320]   Okay?
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.920]   Hopefully, that's self-explanatory, but let me pray for us, and then you can break up
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.920]   into your small groups.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:54.200]   Father, I pray for your blessing upon our small group time.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:58.720]   I pray for our leaders, Lord, that you give them wisdom to be able to guide the discussion.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:03.040]   I pray that you would bring fruitfulness in all the things, Lord God, that we have gleaned
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:11.560]   from your Word, that it would be fortified, strengthened, and to have a deepening effect
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.280]   of it, Lord God, through our discussion.
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.520]   So I pray, Father, your Holy Spirit would lead and guide us.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.880]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:17.380]   Amen.
