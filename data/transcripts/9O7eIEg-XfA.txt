[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260]   Everyone, let's join our hearts to go before the Lord
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260]   in prayer.
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260]   Heavenly Father, we want to give you
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260]   thanks, God, each and every week.
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.260]   We have our various responsibilities, things
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.060]   that we're busy with, things that occupy our time
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.260]   and attention.
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.560]   And we are grateful that in the midst of all of that,
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.660]   we can come together, focus our minds
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.260]   to the learning of your word, to fellowship in the spirit
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.760]   by gaining insight and conviction.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.660]   And all of this, Lord, we realize is a true grace to us.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.060]   And it is our prayer that because this is routine
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.960]   and because this is week to week,
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.960]   it's our prayer, God, that does not just simply pass by
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.560]   without effect, without fruit, but that rather this
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.360]   would be a spiritual activity that is inspiring,
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.760]   is an encouragement and strengthening of our soul,
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.560]   but also an opportunity to continue to build each other up
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.860]   in the faith.
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.660]   And God, we also want to take this time
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.860]   to pray, rendering our hearts, God,
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.460]   that as each time we, with a united voice, sing to you,
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.160]   we know, Father God, that it's not just songs
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.760]   that we happen to perform, but rather, God,
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.260]   it's praise lifted up to you.
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.660]   And so we pray that it be pleasing in your sight.
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.660]   We pray, Father God, that even as we lift our hearts
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.960]   to something that is nourishing our own souls.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.060]   And so, God, we just truly want to thank you again and pray
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.360]   that tonight we would have a blessed time of our worship
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.860]   and study.
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.260]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:30.760]   Let's lift up our hearts in worship.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.860]   When I fear my faith.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:54.660]   When I fear my faith will fail, Christ will hold me fast.
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:08:03.160]   When the tempter would prevail, he will hold me fast.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:11.860]   I could never keep my hope through life's fearful path.
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:19.260]   For my love is often cold, he must hold me fast.
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:26.260]   He will hold me fast.
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.060]   He will hold me fast.
[00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:35.060]   For my Savior loves me so.
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:38.060]   He will hold me fast.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:52.060]   Those he saves.
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.460]   Those he saves are his delight.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.460]   Christ will hold me fast.
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:07.960]   Precious in his holy sight, he will hold me fast.
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:13.860]   He'll not let my soul be lost.
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.860]   His promises shall last.
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:25.860]   Bought by him at such a cost, he will hold me fast.
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:32.860]   He will hold me fast.
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.360]   He will hold me fast.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.360]   For my Savior loves me so.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.360]   He will hold me fast.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:58.360]   For my life.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.360]   For my life he bled and died.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.360]   Christ will hold me fast.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.360]   Justice has been satisfied.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.360]   He will hold me--
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.360]   Raise with him.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.860]   Raise with him to endless life.
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.360]   He will hold me fast.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:29.360]   Till our faith is turned to sight.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:38.360]   When he comes at last, he will hold me fast.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.360]   He will hold me fast.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:47.360]   For my Savior loves me so.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.360]   He will hold me fast.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.360]   He will hold.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.360]   He will hold me fast.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.360]   He will hold me fast.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.360]   For my Savior loves me so.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.360]   He will hold me fast.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.360]   For my Savior loves me so.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:18.360]   He will hold me fast.

[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:40.360]   What gift of grace is Jesus my Redeemer?
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:47.360]   There is no more for heaven now to give.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:54.360]   He is my joy, my righteousness and freedom.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:01.360]   My steadfast love, my deep and boundless peace.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:09.360]   To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:16.360]   For my life is wholly bound to his.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:21.360]   Oh, how strange and divine, and I can sing.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:29.360]   All is mine, yet not I, but the Christ in me.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.360]   [Guitar music]
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:40.360]   Night is dark, but I am not forsaken.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:47.360]   For by my side, the Savior, he will stay.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:54.360]   I labor on in weakness and rejoicing.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:00.360]   For in my knee, his power is displayed.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:08.360]   To this I hold, my shepherd will defend me.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:15.360]   Through the deepest valley, he will lead.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:22.360]   Oh, the night has been won, and I shall overcome.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:28.360]   Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:38.360]   [Guitar music]
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:45.360]   The fate I dread, I know I am forgiven.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:52.360]   The future sure, the price it has been paid.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:59.360]   For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:06.360]   And he was raised to overthrow the grave.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:14.360]   To this I hold, my sin has been defeated.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:21.360]   Jesus now and ever is my plea.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:27.360]   Oh, the chains are released, I can sing.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:35.360]   I am free, yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.360]   [Guitar music]
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:46.360]   With every breath, with every breath, I long to follow Jesus.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:53.360]   For he has said that he will bring me home.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:15:00.360]   And day by day, I know he will renew me.
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:07.360]   Until I, until I stand with joy before the throne.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:15.360]   To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:22.360]   All the glory evermore to him.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:30.360]   When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:35.360]   Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:44.360]   To this I hold, to this I hold, my hope is only Jesus.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:51.360]   All the glory evermore to him.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:59.360]   When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:06.360]   Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:14.360]   When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:21.360]   Yet not I, but through Christ in me.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:30.360]   Not I, but through Christ in me.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.360]   That's saying I just want to praise him.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:40.360]   I just want to praise you.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:48.360]   Lift my hands and say, I love you.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:55.360]   You are everything to me.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:04.360]   And I exalt your holy name on high.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:10.360]   One more time, I just want to praise you.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:17.360]   And I just want to praise you.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:25.360]   Lift my hands and say, I love you.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:32.360]   You are everything to me.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:40.360]   And I exalt your holy name.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:48.360]   I exalt your holy name.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:56.360]   I exalt your holy name on high.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:08.360]   Amen.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:14.360]   Well, I just have a few announcements for all of you before we break into our discussion.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:21.360]   First, this coming Sunday, I sent out an email about our Korea Summer Missions interest.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:32.360]   I do want to say two thoughts about that is one, there is a need to get the roster established pretty early for the sake of securing our flights, etc.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:40.360]   But also, I sent the email because of the short notice that this Sunday at 1pm in the Sprouts room is this interest meeting.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:46.360]   Please note though that obviously we can't take everybody, so there is going to be limited space on that trip.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:52.360]   Some of you guys, I apologize, I sent that email and it looks almost like a command like go.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:57.360]   And so some of you sent me an email saying, I'm so sorry, I can't get off work that late.
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.360]   Just a generic announcement, my fault for sending it that way.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:07.360]   Number two, Saturday the 18th is our men's fellowship.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:14.360]   And so because we need our head count for the food, make sure that if you have not signed up for that to do that ASAP.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:22.360]   The last announcement is going to be that, you know, I know some of you guys are just rushing over from work.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.360]   And some of you drive far just to get here in midweek through traffic.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:31.360]   So we appreciate you guys making all that effort to fulfill that membership covenant to come.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.360]   But we want to just give the encouragement to come early.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:40.360]   Right now at around 7, we could see a lot of scattered chairs, etc, etc.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:47.360]   Please note that A, if you're trying to grab dinner, you can just bring it here because actually our cafe opens at 530.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:53.360]   And we're really thankful for the volunteers who are manning that the cafe thing.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.360]   And they're going to be actually serving drinks and stuff like that.
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:05.360]   So if you're doing especially, let's say meetups, and I know a lot of you guys are, and you're finding that, oh, my gosh, like we kind of lose track of time and you're running over here kind of late.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.360]   Just do it here so that you're not late.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:18.360]   OK, so I just want to give the encouragement that aside from these kind of circumstances, we can't avoid to try and make sure we're on time so that we worship together when we start at 7 and that we can get into discussion right away, too.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:23.360]   OK, all right, please go ahead into your discussion time and we'll come back here at 8.

[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:08.360]   >> At this time, let's gather together for the teaching hour.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:14.360]   And so those of you guys in the room, please go ahead and take a moment to come on out.
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:20.360]   And apologies for cutting some of you guys' discussion.
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.360]   It seems like you guys are having a lively discussion on this one.
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.360]   And there is a lot.
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:29.360]   Actually, I'm guessing a lot of you guys camped out on verse 11.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:33.360]   And these examples are very convicting.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:37.360]   But again, for those of you in the room, we'll give you guys a minute to just go ahead and come on out.
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.360]   And then we'll walk through the passage together.
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:47.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:54.360]   Okay.
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:59.360]   So I think while people are getting situated, I can take a moment to read to us the passage.
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:05.360]   Just so that we do multiple renditions and reading of that text.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.360]   So starting from verse 11, it says,
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:10.360]   "Woe to them, for they have gone the way of Cain.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:14.360]   And for pay they have rushed headlong into the air of Balaam,
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.360]   and perished in the rebellion of Korah.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:20.360]   These are the men who are hidden reefs in your love feasts,
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.360]   when they feast with you without fear,
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:26.360]   caring for themselves, clouds without water, carried along by winds,
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:30.360]   autumn trees without fruit, doubly dead and uprooted,
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:35.360]   wild waves of the sea casting up their own shame like foam,
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:39.360]   wandering stars from whom the black darkness has been reserved forever.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:43.360]   It was also about these men that Enoch in the seventh generation,
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:47.360]   from Adam prophesied saying,
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.360]   'Behold, the Lord came with many thousands of his holy ones,
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:52.360]   to execute judgment upon all,
[01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:58.360]   and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds which they have done in an ungodly way,
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:02.360]   and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:07.360]   These are grumblers, finding fault, following after their own lusts.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:13.360]   They speak arrogantly, flattering people for the sake of gaining an advantage.'"
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:17.360]   So, as we look at this passage as a quick way of review,
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:20.360]   you know, the letter is brief,
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:24.360]   but there is this core section all the way from verse 4 to 16,
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:27.360]   talking about the ungodly and their pattern,
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:30.360]   and their destruction that is certain.
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:33.360]   And the message to us is that we have to contend,
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:38.360]   it says "content," my bad, contend earnestly for the faith.
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:40.360]   We're going to play a game, actually.
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:44.360]   If you can find the grammatical error or a typo, you win prizes.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:50.360]   And then here, starting all the way actually from verse 4,
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:53.360]   we are given so many descriptors,
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:57.360]   highlights of this is their character, this is their message.
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.360]   And we recognize that these certain persons,
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:04.360]   and he says these men, these people, they creep in unnoticed,
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:07.360]   they turn grace into licentiousness,
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:11.360]   and essentially deny our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.360]   We saw that in verse 5 through 7 by way of review,
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:19.360]   that the pattern of them, I guess you could even say the spirit of them,
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.360]   was from long ago because we have our flesh that is completely corrupt,
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:28.360]   we have our enemy who has the same old schemes that he turns into multiple different ways.
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:31.360]   But we have the Exodus generation who did not believe,
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:35.360]   we have angels who were arrogant and did not have any restraint
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.360]   and didn't keep their own domain,
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:40.360]   we have Sodom and Gomorrah where they indulge in gross immoralities
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:43.360]   and they were constantly given over to their lusts.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:47.360]   This is a quick review of the descriptions of these people,
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:50.360]   and for us, they should be categories by which we think like,
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:54.360]   "Oh yeah, this is a pattern of the flesh and of the enemy."
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:58.360]   And it's actually existent all around us.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:02.360]   And sometimes we see patterns of it even in ourselves, right?
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:06.360]   And then, from this passage, I'm just going to summarize,
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:11.360]   verses 8 through 10, we noticed that it was highlighting this idea
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.360]   of that when an individual is an apostate,
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:17.360]   when somebody comes into the church,
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:21.360]   you know, doing that kind of creeping in and
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.360]   making perverse the things that we're trying to do
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.360]   in fellowship and study of the word,
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.360]   we find that actually these individuals are highly arrogant.
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:35.360]   That we saw that they had no restraint, they had no respect for authority,
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.360]   but rather they revile in ignorance and pride.
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.360]   They just speak stuff they don't even understand,
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:43.360]   and instinctually they just react.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.360]   And so those are some of the things that we wanted to make sure like,
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.360]   "Oh man, if we see this kind of stuff, then we can know, right,
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.360]   that there's a danger here, there's a threat to our community,
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:55.360]   and we have to be on the alert and on the guard."
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:58.360]   So for us, I apologize for those of you in the back,
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:03.360]   this is just an overview of the passage today.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:09.360]   I broke it down because after then highlighting for a segment there,
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:12.360]   right, this is what they say, this is what they do,
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:15.360]   it's almost kind of like, "Oh my gosh, oh my gosh,"
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:20.360]   and then boom, woe to them as a word of condemnation and judgment.
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:25.360]   And so I wrote on the left that verse 11 I would see as their judgment,
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:30.360]   and it says, "For," and if you notice, like I highlighted here,
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.360]   skipping some words, "Cain, Balaam, Korah,"
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:37.360]   and clearly these are examples of the pattern, right?
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:42.360]   The kind of spirit that exists in those who are of the devil.
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:48.360]   Verse 12, we see that he's describing, I highlighted here in the orange,
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:53.360]   oops, here in the orange, that it's descriptions of their character
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:58.360]   by highlighting in very elaborative, almost poetic way.
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.360]   You have to think about this is who they are, okay?
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:06.360]   Verse 14 highlights their judgment, and then verse 16 goes back to
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:10.360]   what they do in their character, their grumblers and fault finders,
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:13.360]   and they follow their own lust, etc., etc.,
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:16.360]   reiteration of their character, okay?
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:18.360]   So this to me is helpful.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.360]   You don't have to break it exactly like this.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:24.360]   It's helpful so that I can take the bite-sized pieces and meditate about it,
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:27.360]   of which the first one is going to be, "The woe to them,
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:31.360]   for they have gone the way of Cain, and for pay they have rushed headlong
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:36.360]   into the heir of Balaam and perished in the rebellion of Korah," okay?
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:41.360]   Now when we think about verse 11 and we think about this idea of
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:46.360]   the woe to them, you know, actually this idea of woe,
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:49.360]   obviously we just don't talk like this anymore, you know?
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:52.360]   And as a matter of fact, I mean, we should be very careful to ever say to somebody,
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:56.360]   "Woe to you, man," because what it would mean is,
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:59.360]   "I wish you were cursed," right?
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:03.360]   It's like the ultimate spiritual condemnation, kind of saying,
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:06.360]   "You are anathema," would be the synonymous term.
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:12.360]   But the thing about it is, where else in the Scriptures is that most familiar to us?
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:16.360]   Actually, it would either be from the prophets of old, like Ezekiel,
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:22.360]   or the most famous would be Matthew 23, when Jesus is looking at the establishment,
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.360]   the Pharisees, and he would look at them and say, "Woe to you, Pharisees.
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:32.360]   You clean the outside, and inside you're filthy and rotten with dead bones," right?
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.360]   That's the phrasing there.
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:37.360]   So it makes us kind of think for a moment, it's like, "Whoa."
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:44.360]   With the same kind of indignation, and also almost a finality of judgment,
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:47.360]   he is speaking about these individuals, yes?
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:50.360]   And in the previous passage, Jude talks about them as,
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:54.360]   "These individuals have been marked out for condemnation," okay?
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:58.360]   And to me, as soon as I hear this, I do take a moment to just reflect,
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:01.360]   and I'm going to ask you guys later, like,
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:06.360]   Jude is clearly telling us, for us to be careful, have our eyes open,
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:09.360]   but there's this question, should we also, as Christians,
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:13.360]   in some certain scenarios, be able to mark out individuals
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.360]   and say that person is a threat to the church, woe to them,
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:19.360]   and condemn them in such a final way?
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:23.360]   Or are we to always say every single person who walks into the church,
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:27.360]   they're deserving of hope, ministry, and grace?
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.360]   That's something for us to think about.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:34.360]   I think there are some times when it just doesn't sit right with us, right?
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:39.360]   To be able to say that person we reject from fellowship.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.360]   That's harsh.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.360]   It seems incredibly unloving.
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.360]   But are there instances where we need to practice that?
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.360]   Something to think about.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:52.360]   Moving forward, for the sake of time, we take a look at this important part,
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:55.360]   and clearly we see, again, I think we could camp out of verse 11
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:58.360]   and do a full hour of study.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:02.360]   Because what we notice is, in describing them,
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:06.360]   they go, they rush, and they perish.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:09.360]   He describes this almost trajectory, right?
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.360]   That when these individuals start on this path of Cain,
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.360]   there's a slippery slope.
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.360]   The Proverbs talks about this.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:21.360]   Whenever you walk in such a way, or whenever you stand with such a person,
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.360]   or then you walk with such a person, you sit with such a person,
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:27.360]   it's going to lead you down this destruction.
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:32.360]   But clearly there's a description of the way of Cain,
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:36.360]   the error of Balaam, and then this rebellion of Korah.
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:39.360]   And I hope you guys had a chance to actually meditate and think about
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:42.360]   what was Cain's sin?
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:48.360]   Is it just because he offered grain and not bloody, medium-rare, delicious meat?
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.360]   Was that the issue? Obviously not.
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.360]   I mean, there's the hard issue of jealousy.
[01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:55.360]   There's this countenance that fell out of reaction,
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:58.360]   and there was this destructive, murderous kind of thought, all that stuff.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:01.360]   I hope you guys got a chance to think about that.
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:06.360]   For the sake of our time, I'm going to just highlight one.
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:10.360]   And I highlighted the rebellion of Korah because it was less known.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:14.360]   I think Balaam a lot of people know because of Donkey.
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:16.360]   The donkey and stuff like that.
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:20.360]   Now Balaam was a--clearly his sin was he was a prophet for hire.
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.360]   And when they offered more money, he was like,
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.360]   "Okay, I'll ask again. Let's do this."
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:27.360]   But with Korah, what was the sin?
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:30.360]   Turn your Bibles to Numbers 16.
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.360]   This one we'll do just a quick run-through.
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:37.360]   I didn't put it on the PowerPoint because there's a couple verses I want us to look at.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:41.360]   But we asked the question, okay, if he's highlighting the example
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:45.360]   and he's thinking about this idea of--
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:48.360]   Okay, let's see if I can do--
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:50.360]   Oops, never mind.
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:53.360]   Okay, highlighting the example of Korah,
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.360]   what are we thinking about here?
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:58.360]   And turn to Numbers 16.3 and look what it says.
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:03.360]   It says, "The people," right, "they assembled together against Moses and Aaron
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:06.360]   and said to them, 'You've gone too far.'"
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:09.360]   Right, "You've gone far enough for all the congregation are holy.
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.360]   Every one of them and the Lord is in their midst.
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:16.360]   So why do you exalt yourselves above assembly of the Lord?"
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:19.360]   Okay, how manipulative, right?
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:22.360]   They're grumbling against the leadership and saying,
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:24.360]   "You think you're so special?
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:26.360]   We're all priesthood of saints."
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:29.360]   Is that true? It is true, right?
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:32.360]   "We're all holy. God considers us all one."
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:36.360]   All true, but clearly their motive and their heart was all wrong.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:39.360]   And if Moses and Aaron were not strong leaders,
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.360]   maybe they would have said, "Oh, you know, you're right.
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:45.360]   You're accusing us of holding too tight onto the leadership authority.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.360]   Maybe everybody deserves a chance.
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:50.360]   Maybe you're--it could happen."
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:54.360]   And then what happens later on is--take a look at verse 10.
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.360]   I'm skipping a bunch here.
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:59.360]   Basically, Moses said to Korah, "Oh, you guys need to listen."
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.360]   Verse 10, it says, "And that you brought us nearer to Korah
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:04.360]   and all your brothers, sons of Levi, with you."
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.360]   He's saying, "Oh, my goodness, what are you doing?
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:09.360]   You rallied your people to come and complain,
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:12.360]   and now you're seeking for the priesthood too?
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:17.360]   And therefore you and all your company are gathered together against the Lord?
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.360]   You're not really complaining against me.
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:21.360]   You're complaining against God."
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.360]   And what's happening is these are Levites.
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.360]   They have a special place in the service of God,
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.360]   but the priesthood, Aaron and his children,
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:33.360]   were specifically designated to offer the sacrifice and incense.
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:38.360]   But Korah wanted a little chance to do something special.
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:42.360]   Maybe he thought, "You know, it's my gift to lift up incense."
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.360]   Like nowadays a lot of people talk about, "It's my gift to teach.
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.360]   Let me do it," right?
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:50.360]   Next, let's go down to verse 19.
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:54.360]   "So Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the door of the tent of meeting,
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:58.360]   and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the congregation."
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.360]   If you highlight your Bible, this is like exclamation point.
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:02.360]   It's so scary.
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:05.360]   "The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron and said,
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:11.360]   'Don't separate yourself from among this congregation, that I may consume them instantly.'
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:17.360]   He said, 'You need to step back, because when my fury comes down, I don't want you to get hurt.'"
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.360]   That's so scary.
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:24.360]   And then later on in Numbers 16, the same chapter, verse 34,
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:30.360]   it says, "All Israel who were around them fled out at their outcry,
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:33.360]   for they said, 'The earth may swallow us up.'
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:40.360]   Fire also came forth from the Lord and consumed 250 men who were offering the incense."
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:43.360]   So essentially what happens to certain short in the story is,
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:47.360]   basically Moses says, "Listen, you guys want to complain?
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:50.360]   You guys are going to see that you're not going to die a natural death,
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:52.360]   but miraculous things are going to happen."
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:56.360]   And Moses is like, "Maybe the earth may open up."
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:00.360]   And then lo and behold, that very moment, the earth opens up and just kills them with fire,
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:04.360]   and the people are falling into it alive, that they're crying as they're falling.
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.360]   It's so frightening.
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:09.360]   But take a moment to think for a moment, right?
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:15.360]   Was Korah's sin so bad, right?
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:18.360]   Did he murder somebody?
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:27.360]   Did he pillage the temple goods, the temple, the meeting place, the gold, the utensils?
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.360]   Did he steal that stuff and hold it for himself?
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:35.360]   Actually, what's crazy about this story is he wanted to offer up incense, and he did.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:39.360]   And then what God did was he actually burned all of them and their tools,
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:43.360]   and he placed it, clasped it against the altar, so that everyone would remember,
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:47.360]   "If you ever do this again, you will die like these people."
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:50.360]   It's so frightening, okay?
[01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:56.360]   Well, all I'm going to say about that is what a convicting idea that pride is in all of us,
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:22:02.360]   and perhaps this little selfish ambition that wants to do the whole "let my wings fly"
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:07.360]   and at least see what I'm capable of, that kind of stuff is in all of us.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:11.360]   And yet when it comes to keeping God's people holy,
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:16.360]   when it comes to the community of the Lord, God sees that as so corrupting,
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:21.360]   he would actually kill the entire host that came, the congregation that came.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.360]   As a matter of fact, as soon as God pronounced that judgment,
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:29.360]   a lot of people said, "Oh, Lord, please, please, are you going to kill us because it's one guy?"
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:33.360]   God saw it as a corrupting element in the community,
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:38.360]   this selfish ambition, this desire to showcase what we can do,
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:42.360]   this grumbling attitude towards God's chosen leaders.
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:44.360]   It's something to think about, okay?
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:49.360]   And so there's three different examples,
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:55.360]   and I think it would be good for us to take a look at each individual example for its own merit,
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:58.360]   and then think, "What's the general description here?"
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.360]   Well, the general description is pretty clear.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:03.360]   These are individuals who have jealousy in their heart,
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:07.360]   they're in it for their own gain, and they have this ambition.
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:11.360]   So you almost get this picture of the self-willed man, right?
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:14.360]   In it for himself.
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:19.360]   Okay, so we move to verse 12 through 13,
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:30.360]   and what we see is a reflection, like a really vivid, picturesque depiction of the character of these men.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:33.360]   And it's pretty crazy because there's so many, actually.
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:36.360]   Once you break it down into little segments,
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:39.360]   what you notice is that there's the hidden reefs,
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:42.360]   there are the clouds, there are the trees,
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:45.360]   there are the waves, and there are wandering stars.
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:46.360]   Okay?
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:50.360]   And again, if we took a moment to think about each one,
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:54.360]   for example, letter A, it talks about hidden reefs.
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:24:01.360]   Man, the kind of beauty in the way that he describes this sinner
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:04.360]   is kind of crazy because he says "hidden reefs,"
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:07.360]   which in the Greek is the word "spilos,"
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:12.360]   and in the feminine form of that noun, it's a stone that's hidden
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:15.360]   and used a lot, talking about basically like an iceberg.
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:20.360]   It's a reef hidden underneath the waters, hits the boat, and it shipwrecks, right?
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:24.360]   And so the scripture in its picture is pretty profound
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:28.360]   because these are people who may have been in the church,
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:31.360]   being a good, functioning member for several years,
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:35.360]   and then all of a sudden you start to see their motive.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.360]   You start to see what they're after.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:40.360]   And then only later do you realize, "Oh my goodness,
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.360]   this person's capable of incredible damage."
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:47.360]   But then if you take a look at some of the other translations,
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:49.360]   you'll notice that there's a little bit of variance
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:56.360]   because let's say within the King James, it talks about them as "spots."
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:00.360]   In the NIV, it talks about them as "blemishes,"
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:03.360]   when you guys do the comparison of the translations.
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:08.360]   Because that word just in the masculine form,
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:13.360]   or even as a verse, "bleru," means "to blemish or to stain."
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:18.360]   And so these individuals are like stones that are corrupting and staining
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:20.360]   that which is supposed to be good, and he describes it that
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:26.360]   when you have these feasts, they're complete blemishes to your community.
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:33.360]   Another one I want to highlight to you is, out of all of these ones,
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:38.360]   I think there is, again, for each one, there's something to meditate about,
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:41.360]   like, "Whoa, this is the character of these people."
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:44.360]   But what is maybe a repeated theme?
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:49.360]   What is maybe the kind of overarching description of these individuals?
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:53.360]   And I really, really get convicted by this idea of letter C,
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:56.360]   which is "trees without fruit."
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:59.360]   Because that does seem to be a repeated idea, right?
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:03.360]   We have clouds with no water, we have trees with no fruit,
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:08.360]   we have stars that wander, and so there's no good for any kind--
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:13.360]   if we're talking about maritime, ship, that kind of stuff,
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:16.360]   there's no good for anything if there are wandering stars.
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:19.360]   And so I want to ask this question for you guys,
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:23.360]   are we exercising a kind of discretion now?
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:26.360]   There's actually tons of voices everywhere.
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:31.360]   I mean, we had many, many churches go through a movement
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.360]   called the Seeker-Friendly Movement, then we had Word of Faith Movement,
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:39.360]   and then we have, even more recently, Gospel-Centric Movement,
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.360]   and then there was a hyper version of that,
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:44.360]   and then now we have the Ex-Pangelical Movement,
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:47.360]   and then we have--and the list just goes on.
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.360]   Okay. Now some of us were just like,
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:53.360]   "Yep, I don't recognize any of those movements you listed,
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.360]   because I don't really care," you know?
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:59.360]   But there's a lot of people around us who are into those things.
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:03.360]   Do you have ways where you can discern, is that good or bad?
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.360]   And one of the things we should for sure be asking is,
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:08.360]   what in the world is the fruit of this?
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:11.360]   Take, for example, that Gospel-Centric Movement.
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:14.360]   If you take--it was good because there was people who were saying,
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:20.360]   "We dare not be legalistic because legalism is an atrocity against the Gospel."
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:26.360]   But a hyper form of that, actually, in its fruitfulness, it bore no fruit.
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:29.360]   It essentially gave people a pass on repentance.
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:33.360]   It limited the preaching and said, "No indicatives for us, no commands.
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.360]   Just tell us what Jesus did."
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:40.360]   It bore zero fruit and just gave license to everybody,
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:43.360]   "If you feel guilty, now you feel okay to come."
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.360]   And the fruit that was born out of that, actually, was a lot of division.
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:51.360]   "Is your church Gospel-centered? Is this Gospel-centered?"
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.360]   Weigh the fruit of certain things.
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.360]   What does it produce?
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:02.360]   Okay, so here in verse 12 through 13, we have the characteristics of these men.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.360]   And, you know, again, it's very, very poetic and descriptive,
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:10.360]   and I hope we got a chance to just meditate on those things.
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:14.360]   For the sake of time, let's go to verse 14 through 15,
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:17.360]   which was the judgment section.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:21.360]   And it says, "It was about these men that Enoch prophesied, saying,
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:26.360]   'In the seventh generation of Adam, behold, the Lord came with many thousands
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:30.360]   of His holy ones to execute judgment upon all,
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:35.360]   and to convict all the ungodly of their ungodly deeds.'"
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:37.360]   We're going to do a quick side note.
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:42.360]   And that is, some of you may have asked the question of, "Who is Enoch?
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:44.360]   What is he quoting?"
[01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:46.360]   And, yes, if you look it up, if you guys have a study Bible,
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:50.360]   it will say that Jude is quoting from the Book of Enoch.
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:56.360]   There are what's called apocryphal, outside of the canon, three letters of Enoch.
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:59.360]   And here, I know some of you guys can't see it,
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:05.360]   but I'm going to give you what is the kind of structure of Jewish tradition
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:09.360]   and the Jewish canon.
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:16.360]   The thing that you have to focus on here is right in the middle, there is the Torah.
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:20.360]   Okay, anybody know what the Torah is?
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:22.360]   Hint?
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:25.360]   I heard it, first five books, right?
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.360]   Excellent.
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:31.360]   The first five books of Moses is seen as the--oh, I'm so sorry, I just see it right here.
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:40.360]   Okay, first five books of Moses are seen as the epitome at the core that gives life to everything.
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:45.360]   What you have in the Tanakh is the building up through the history books and the writings,
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:51.360]   and then you have the prophets, and the Tanakh, essentially, you can think of equated to the Old Testament.
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:57.360]   But building around it is the Mishnah, which are commentaries pertaining to these books.
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:02.360]   And then all of these commentaries combined, basically, is what you're going to probably hear
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:06.360]   if you've studied anything about Jewish culture history, there's a Talmud,
[01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:10.360]   which is essentially the commentaries of the rabbi.
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:15.360]   But over time, those are seen just as weighty and just as authoritative as the scriptures.
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.360]   Why am I talking about this?
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:23.360]   It's because, as you can see, the Jewish people had an incredible respect for scripture,
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:27.360]   and at the center of it was the core first five books.
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:31.360]   According to their own tradition, they had what's called the Midrash,
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:36.360]   and that's additional stories that they had on top of the Torah.
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:41.360]   But never did they ever dare mess with the Torah and include those books in.
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:45.360]   Where does Inah come in? It's one of these books in the Midrash.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:47.360]   They're stories.
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:52.360]   It begins as oral traditions, and then it came into written form.
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:54.360]   And one of those stories is the Book of Enoch.
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:58.360]   Typically, they refer to the first one when they say Book of Enoch.
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:03.360]   Does that mean that somehow the canon is now compromised because we have these other letters?
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:07.360]   No. Everybody knew across time there were other writings.
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:09.360]   They consulted them. They read them.
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:14.360]   But they never gave it the same kind of respect that they did to the Torah or the Tanakh.
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:15.360]   Does that make sense?
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:20.360]   But because there was oral tradition, will you sometimes get instances
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:24.360]   where the scripture is mentioning something and it's also mentioned in another outside book,
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:27.360]   an apocryphal book? Yes.
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:32.360]   Can they allude to things that were actually happening in history or correct? Yes.
[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:35.360]   But it does not mean that the Torah or the Tanakh was relying on it
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:40.360]   or that it somehow was on the same level.
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:46.360]   So the other thing, this was just a brief thing for you, is time.
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:51.360]   The reason why it's also time difference is because the Mishnah and the Talmud are here.
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:55.360]   And what we're saying is that when it comes to some of these midrash books,
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:32:00.360]   they came much later than the actual canonical books that the Jewish people revered.
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:03.360]   OK? All right.
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:07.360]   So going back to here, that's just a brief note because some questions came up
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:09.360]   and I got a question about that.
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:12.360]   And I'm going to email everybody that PowerPoint.
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:17.360]   I apologize. I never, ever emailed you before, but I will email you this one.
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:25.360]   OK. But clearly, I mean, we don't have to like mull over what's happening here.
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:34.360]   Think about the pervasiveness of sin, but then also the exacting pervasiveness of God's judgment.
[01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:40.360]   What's repeated here is that all the ungodly deeds, all the ungodly way,
[01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:46.360]   all the harsh words, all the things and statements that were spoken, God is going to judge them.
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:51.360]   And yes, although maybe in the moment, in the immediate moment, a lot of times we look up and we're like,
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:55.360]   "Oh my gosh, this is getting out of hand. Where is our culture going?"
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:33:00.360]   That probably was said throughout history by the godly people, right?
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:05.360]   But we are told God is so perfect in His judgment,
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:11.360]   not a single word that is even careless will go unpunished.
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:16.360]   And I want us to take a moment to think about that is we are thinking about the community
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:20.360]   and God talking about that which stains the community.
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:25.360]   We dare not just flippantly say stuff just because we're like, "This is a pretty novel idea. What do you think about it?"
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:30.360]   You know, like we have to be cautious because one of the things that's very clear here
[01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:35.360]   is the exacting and certain judgment of God.
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:39.360]   Let's now talk about the last verse.
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:48.360]   The last verse, verse 16, is the ungodly character continued, a description of what they do.
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:51.360]   And here it talks about these individuals are grumblers.
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:54.360]   They find fault following after their own lust.
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:34:00.360]   They speak arrogantly, flattering people for the sake of gaining an advantage.
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:04.360]   I think what is interesting and very convicting about this portion
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:09.360]   is that we've already seen the lust, you know, the giving to sensuality.
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:12.360]   We've seen the arrogance and reviling, etc.
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:21.360]   We've seen the example of Balaam where for pay and selfish gain he would just say whatever, you know, Balak asked him, etc., etc.
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:28.360]   Well, one of the things that's introduced here is the idea of the grumblers and the fault finders, right?
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:34.360]   And I want us to take a moment just to meditate on that and just realize like,
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:43.360]   "Whoa, grumbling and finding fault is such an easy sin to fall into."
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:51.360]   There's a sense to which if we're going to highlight or I guess mark out apostates based on this,
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:55.360]   are we going to look at everyone and say, "Are you falling?"
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:58.360]   Are we going to all look at each other with suspicious eyes?
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:01.360]   Like, "Why are you complaining?"
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:09.360]   But the fact of the matter is, one, we should take heed because although maybe grumbling and complaining
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:14.360]   is technically a respectable sin, meaning understandable sin, there are so many things that irritate us,
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:18.360]   there are so many things that don't go well or are expected,
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:24.360]   that we can find ourselves excusing those things as minor sins that everybody falls into.
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:28.360]   But we're looking not simply as, "Look how bad they are," but we're actually looking at,
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:34.360]   "Look how seriously God sees this sin." Right?
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:40.360]   We're not just simply looking at, "Oh, look how wicked and vicious these evil people are,"
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:44.360]   but we are also seeing it in terms of, "You know God is going to judge this."
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:47.360]   That's part of the message of this.
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:52.360]   When he says, "I want to remind you," going hand in hand with the picture of, "This is sin,"
[01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:58.360]   is also the reminder, "You know God will judge this."
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:02.360]   And so there's conviction for us to remember.
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:04.360]   I want to highlight for you there's a proverb that says,
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:11.360]   "Like charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire, so is a contentious man to kindle strife."
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:16.360]   That Hebrew word for contention is the same as the murmuring man, right?
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:19.360]   The one who's constantly just grumbling inside.
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:24.360]   What's very interesting is this term for the fault finder in some of your translations,
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:29.360]   it describes it or, I guess, translates it as malcontent people.
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:32.360]   They're the individuals who are discontent in the ESV.
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:40.360]   And so it gives us a little bit more description on the kind of heart and attitude behind what they do.
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:50.360]   Now, for us, I'm going to now wrap up by saying it is so essential for us to keep praying for wisdom
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:57.360]   because it's one thing for us to be like, "Yeah, we see this. I can list for you ten different descriptions of the evil ones."
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:04.360]   But then on the backside, you have one right next to you, where you're like there with him, so to speak.
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:09.360]   What I mean by that is, it is one thing to have all the explicit categories within the scripture.
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:16.360]   It's another thing to wisely, prudently say, "You know what? This right now is a danger to us." Right?
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:23.360]   And we have to be praying because by way of the schemes of the devil, it is subtle.
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:28.360]   It typically, like majority sounds pretty good. "We're all holy." Yeah, you're right.
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:30.360]   "Priesthood of believers." Yeah, you're right.
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:37.360]   That's one of the things recently I got into an argument about protecting the church from this kind of liberal theology where,
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:42.360]   let's say even the topic of women in ministry, women who are preaching the scriptures.
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:45.360]   Now it's a hotly contested and debated issue.
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:52.360]   To us at our church, we're saying, "Hey, we have great, great respect for the value of women because we're created equal in God."
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:38:01.360]   But one, there's a difference between what is priesthood of believers and our equal standing with Christ versus church ecclesiology,
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:04.360]   meaning how we practice church. Right?
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:09.360]   But the analogy actually, that sort of argument of, "Hey, we're all priesthood of believers. We're all equal because of Christ."
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.360]   Doesn't God consider all of us holy now?
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:18.360]   That's literally used as the argument for that side, for the liberal side.
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:24.360]   Now is that something we should look at and say, "Oh my gosh, we dare not." Right?
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:26.360]   Well, I'm going to give that challenge to you.
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:32.360]   Scripture says in this time that Satan is asked for permission.
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:39.360]   He is almost in a bullish way seeking to sway the congregation, left and right.
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:45.360]   And if he can get one footing even on that angle, he's going to push for another footing on this angle.
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:50.360]   And what's necessary is every single one of us has to have the discernment to be able to say,
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:56.360]   "Not only do I know the descriptions here, but I'm able to see it coming in life." Right?
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:02.360]   So I want to leave you with that encouragement is, yes, we have to be wise that we're not hypercritical.
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:09.360]   We're not suspect of everybody, that we're actually practicing loves that believes all things, that hopes in all things, that trusts.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:16.360]   But at the same time, given the generation, I mean, this is an emphatic charge to us to be able to tell the difference between the times.
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:22.360]   Let's pray.
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:26.360]   Lord God, we pray for discernment and wisdom.
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:34.360]   We pray, Father God, first for the discernment and wisdom to recognize sinful patterns in our own lives.
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:36.360]   Lord God, are we not greedy?
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:44.360]   Lord God, are we not sometimes so self-interested that we may take perverted steps to just gain a slight advantage?
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:48.360]   Lord, sometimes do we not grumble? Do we not complain?
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:53.360]   So God, for all these things, we pray that we would have the greatest and utmost concern,
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:59.360]   that we desire to be washed by your word and truly cleansed by your spirit.
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:10.360]   But as we do that, Lord, help us to have the humility to say, even if I am weak in myself, I will not drop the standards of God.
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:20.360]   And God, when we see this world, this generation, our culture, that we stand firm in your truth, not because we're prideful, but because we're your servants.
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:28.360]   God, we uphold your word, not because we're powerful, but because, Lord, your word deserves that kind of obedience.
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:32.360]   And I pray we would be convicted to that degree.
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:38.360]   Father, give us courage, give us wisdom and discernment. We thank you in Christ's name. Amen.
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:43.360]   For the next time, we're going to be studying verse 17 through 23.
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:47.360]   There are now, it turns to us and says, but you, right?
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:51.360]   Focus on the commands and the participles.
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:55.360]   The participles are the ING, like doing this and doing that.
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:59.360]   And you want to make sure you're highlighting each one and you take the time to meditate.
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:03.360]   Like, hmm, what is this expecting me to do?
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:09.360]   Meditate on personal application because you will immediately recognize that the commands are generic and repeating.
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:15.360]   So if it says, so remember, like you kind of have to ask yourself, like, what am I forgetting?
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:19.360]   What do I need to remember? You know, if it says like hope in the future.
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:23.360]   I mean, 2 Peter was like three weeks in a row.
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:27.360]   You would be like, let's discuss how can we make sure that we're preparing for the future?
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:32.360]   Well, as an anticipation for you, or I guess heads up to you, we're going to talk about that again.
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:36.360]   But in order to make it fruitful, it's got to be really personal to you.
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:43.360]   Like, you know what? I was taking a big, big, you know, moment to analyze what I'm doing.
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:46.360]   And in these ways, I'm actually not thinking about the future at all.
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:50.360]   Right. Or something like that. Make it very personal, please.
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:42:00.360]   And then for today, for discussion questions, number one, scriptures clearly condemn certain people and their behavior for their sinfulness by saying woe to them.
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:05.360]   To what extent should we do the same? Right. Obviously.
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:11.360]   Yeah, we're not apostles and we definitely are not Jesus. So in what sense do we do it in the same way?
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:16.360]   How can we wisely go about discerning who to reject from fellowship or who to minister to?
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:20.360]   Number two, grumbling and complaining is an easy sin to commit.
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:26.360]   So Cher, if you're struggling with this kind of embittered or angst, please do share.
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:34.360]   How does a grumbling heart stain the community? And how can we tell if someone is just a very analytical person?
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:43.360]   OK, or and so they're like not really complaining, but they're actually just being analytical versus somebody who's grumbling, complaining, you know.
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:48.360]   Number three, what should our attitude be towards just generally any movement?
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:51.360]   OK, there's a lot of movements that move. So what's our attitude?
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:59.360]   And then last one, after looking at verse four through 16, we went through basically two full weeks of talking about these apostate people.
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:04.360]   What's a good summary of the people that we should be looking out for or their pattern?
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:08.360]   OK. All right. Thanks, everybody. Go ahead and go into your time of further discussion.
