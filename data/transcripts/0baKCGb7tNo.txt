[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience chattering)
[00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.480]   - First birthday.
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.640]   (audience chattering)
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.640]   - Your sauces are great.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.820]   (audience chattering)
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:37.160]   - No, that's not right.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.220]   - But they were good to me this week, so.
[00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.800]   - Yeah, but I have like,
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.060]   like, planes are in my head all the time.
[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.220]   (audience chattering)
[00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.320]   - I like, I never really knew what else to,
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.660]   how else to fix it.
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.820]   (audience chattering)
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.600]   No, no, no.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.400]   We, everything within the BCC playlist is up for game.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.760]   I try to have, obviously, easy transitions.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   I always try to have one that's like,
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.880]   kinda like a call to worship, which is the firm one,
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.920]   and then the second one,
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.980]   kinda related to the theme or topic.
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.040]   But, it's kinda crazy,
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.300]   but most of the weeks,
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.560]   when I'm praying through the songs,
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.080]   I'll just put it on the Spotify playlist,
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.360]   and as I, after I pray,
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.640]   usually the song, or the next couple songs that come up,
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.760]   I'm like, this is it.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.000]   (audience chattering)
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.040]   So, I feel like, I wanted to sing the second song,
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.160]   like, weeks ago.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.000]   - Okay.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.400]   - It just came into my heart.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.120]   And this one, like, just passed me.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.520]   It's an oldie.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.680]   (audience chattering)
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.640]   - Are you gonna do seven, or seven out of five?
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.920]   - Two.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.380]   - I'm gonna get some water.
[00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.540]   (audience chattering)
[00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.900]   - I've done it.
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:37.700]   - I did it.
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.860]   (audience chattering)
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.020]   (audience chattering)
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.180]   (audience chattering)
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.340]   (audience chattering)
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.500]   (audience chattering)
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:14.280]   (audience chattering)
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.440]   (audience chattering)
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.600]   (audience chattering)
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.760]   (audience chattering)
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.920]   (audience chattering)
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:50.480]   - It's crazy how many people are here.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.640]   (audience chattering)
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.040]   If you think about it, this is like,
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.760]   this is bigger than some churches.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.600]   - It is.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.240]   I think it's bigger than Cross Life.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.080]   - Oh, really?
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.560]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.880]   They only have, like, a couple hundred?
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.680]   - Yeah, this is at least 200, I think.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.520]   They have more.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.720]   - It's like 250, 300?
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.560]   Both sides?
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.480]   - Yeah.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.320]   It's crazy.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.480]   (audience chattering)
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.640]   (audience chattering)
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.800]   (audience chattering)
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.960]   (audience chattering)
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.120]   (audience chattering)

[00:05:38.940 --> 00:06:01.860]   - Hello, hello.
[00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.660]   All right.
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:05.820]   Good evening, everybody.
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.780]   Let's take our seats and get ready
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.620]   for the beginning of our Bible study.
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:26.700]   Okay, please join with me in a word of prayer as we begin.
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.780]   Our God, we wanna take time to thank you in prayer
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.100]   and also worship you with song.
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.100]   We are so grateful, God, that you have,
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.100]   through every generation,
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.420]   proven yourself to be trustworthy and faithful.
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.100]   And in our own lives, God, we know that you are working
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.660]   and you are guiding us.
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.340]   We pray, Father God, that you would help us to continue
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.780]   to go to you in faith, to be about your work,
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.060]   and continue, Lord God, to serve your great kingdom.
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.100]   We ask, God, that you would continue to grant to us
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.860]   strength and wisdom as we look at your word,
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.460]   discuss the book, and have our time of fellowship,
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.740]   and cause it to be fruitful to us, Lord.
[00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.580]   And at this time, again, we want to lift up our voices,
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.020]   to sing your name and continue to lift you up.
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.060]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.900]   - Amen.
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.480]   (gentle music)

[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:28.140]   - Father, we just thank you for this time of worship.
[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.120]   God, we just love you 'cause you loved us first.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.920]   Even when we were yet still sinners, Lord,
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.960]   you demonstrated your love by dying on the cross for our sins
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.060]   and God, we wanna pray that your love
[00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.720]   will not only just fill our hearts,
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.320]   but that it would overflow out of our hearts
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.780]   for us to just be in your word, to share your word,
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.280]   to share the gospel with others,
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:55.400]   that we will continually be led to just abide in you,
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.360]   just trust in you, and really have your heart and attitude
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.080]   to reach not only unbelievers,
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.000]   but even evangelize and disciple within our own church.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.840]   So God, we pray that your love would just bring us
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.800]   to a point where we just can't help but to sing,
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.280]   to shout, to just worship and praise your name,
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.360]   all for your glory and really just to magnify your kingdom
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.800]   through your work in us, God.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.840]   We thank you for your time
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.400]   and it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:30.520]   - All right, good evening again, everybody.

[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.280]   we're gonna be having an all-church cleaning day
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.400]   and we still need some extra helping hands,
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.040]   so please sign up for that.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.920]   We still need about 30 more people
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.780]   so that we can get all the various places
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.940]   of the church covered.
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.680]   And then I wanna make a highlight
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.720]   about the regional Thanksgiving dinner.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:20.880]   Again, that's taking place Sunday, 11/24 at 5 p.m.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.360]   If you have signed up, the confirmation
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.520]   and the assignment emails have gone out.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.760]   So if you signed up but you didn't get one,
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.480]   please make sure to contact Justin ASAP
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.360]   so that we can get that sorted out for you.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.880]   And then for everybody who is a part of the family ministry,
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.780]   please note that there is a Christmas party
[00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.360]   that'll take place Saturday on the 7th,
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.920]   December 7th at 5 p.m.
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.680]   And it's gonna be a great time of fellowship,
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.320]   food, and performances,
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.080]   so please make sure that you sign up for that.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.440]   You aren't automatically signed up
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.240]   just because you're doing one of the performances.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.840]   A lot of the home groups have been assigned
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.220]   to do something like a performance,
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.800]   so please make sure that you individually
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.980]   go ahead and sign up for that, okay?
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.680]   The final announcement that I have for you guys
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.240]   is the BBA season is going to be starting up soon.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.960]   And so for both the men's BBA and the women's BBA,
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.140]   sign-ups will go ahead and open up,
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.340]   and you can check that out here on the QR code
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.120]   on the app or the web.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.920]   Please go ahead and check the schedule.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.800]   And then something to note
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.000]   is that because of the intention
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.880]   of making this a fellowship and intentional activity,
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.880]   we are asking that those who are either in membership class
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.880]   or membership sign up.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.280]   Unfortunately, if you aren't a member or just checking out,
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.800]   this isn't something that we're opening up
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.600]   to everybody yet, okay?
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.640]   Alrighty, thanks, everyone.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.840]   Please go into your discussion.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.040]   We'll be back at eight for the teaching time.

[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.240]   (faintly speaking)
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:27.240]   (faintly speaking)
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:31.240]   (faintly speaking)
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:35.240]   (faintly speaking)
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:39.240]   (faintly speaking)
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:43.240]   (faintly speaking)
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:47.240]   (faintly speaking)
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:51.240]   (faintly speaking)
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.240]   All right, well, if you're in the other rooms,
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.240]   if you could make your way over.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:00.240]   (faintly speaking)
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:04.240]   (faintly speaking)
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.240]   (faintly speaking)
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:11.240]   We'll give it just a minute more,
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.240]   so everyone can come over.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.240]   (faintly speaking)
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:24.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:28.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:32.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:36.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:40.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:44.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:52.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:56.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:00.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:04.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:08.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:12.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:16.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:20.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:24.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:28.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:32.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:36.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:40.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:44.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:48.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:52.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:56.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:00.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:04.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:08.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:12.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:16.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:20.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:24.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:28.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:32.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:36.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:40.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:44.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:48.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:52.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:56.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:00.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:08.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:12.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:16.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:20.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:24.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:28.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:32.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:36.160]   (faintly speaking)
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.240]   - All right.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:43.240]   I think it looks like most people have arrived,
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:48.240]   and so let me go ahead and pray for us
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.240]   to open us up this time.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:53.240]   Father, we thank you.
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:54.240]   We thank you, Lord, for the discussion
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.240]   we were able to have, and Lord, as we listen
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:01.240]   and as we go back into our discussions afterwards,
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:04.240]   we pray, God, for hearts that are very moldable,
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.240]   God, ones that are ready to receive your word
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:10.240]   and to apply, it's out of our love for you to obey.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.240]   So thank you, God.
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:13.240]   Thank you for the opportunities that you give,
[01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:15.240]   the privilege it is to be your children.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.240]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.240]   Okay.
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:23.240]   Well, to start here, the master's plan for the church,
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:26.240]   you should have read this chapter,
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.240]   The Lord's Work, The Lord's Way,
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:31.240]   and I put out here some of the headings
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:34.240]   that were in this book, just as a reminder to you,
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.240]   you were able to kind of talk through some of that,
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.240]   perhaps, a vision for the future.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:41.240]   So when we're thinking about the Lord's work,
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:44.240]   we also have to remember it needs to be done
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.240]   the Lord's way, because many times we think
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:50.240]   we can just kind of have maybe a basic understanding
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.240]   of what the Lord's work is, and then we get
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.240]   to do it our way.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.240]   We get to call the shots as to what that looks like,
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:58.240]   and the scriptures are going to tell us
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.240]   what it's supposed to look like,
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:01.240]   or what it ought to look like.
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.240]   And so here, even when it comes to a vision
[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.240]   for the future, you should have been reading
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:08.240]   about this thought of, well, it has to be God's vision,
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.240]   not our vision.
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.240]   We don't get to dictate the terms of this,
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.240]   and we'll talk about that a little bit
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.240]   in today's covenant anyway.
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.240]   A sense of flexibility, because it's going
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.240]   to many times feel inconvenient,
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.240]   or perhaps when we want to do things our way,
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.240]   it's not going to happen the way
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.240]   that we would desire for it to happen,
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.240]   and so we need to be flexible.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.240]   There needs to be a commitment to thoroughness,
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.240]   a commitment to present service,
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:36.240]   an acceptance of opposition as a challenge.
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:38.240]   It's going to be difficult.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.240]   A team spirit, that's where we're united in this.
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:43.240]   That's the way God would desire.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:46.240]   And a sensitivity to the spirits leading in others.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:49.240]   I'm just going to bring three quotes up.
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:52.240]   The first one here is, "The work of the Lord
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.240]   "is never described in the Bible as being easy.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:58.240]   "The words 'work' and 'labor' in verse 58
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.240]   "carry the idea of working to the point of exhaustion.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:03.240]   "Commentator G. Campbell Morgan said
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.240]   "that Paul had in mind the kind of toil
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:09.240]   "that has in it the red blood of sacrifice."
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:13.240]   That kind of toil that wears and weakens, by the way.
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:15.240]   And so the idea of this quote is--
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.240]   Yeah, that's my favorite one.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:20.240]   The idea of this quote is that you work hard.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:23.240]   You work hard, that this labor and toil
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:26.240]   is in fact supposed to be sweat work.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.240]   It's supposed to be difficult.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:32.240]   That our lives here is going to be filled with this.
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:35.240]   "Secondly, anyone committed to the Lord's work
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.240]   "and motivated to reach others
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:39.240]   "will see many needs that haven't been met yet,
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:41.240]   "so he will plan how to meet them.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.240]   "Such a person has a visionary perspective."
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:47.240]   So it's not just working hard, but it's working smart.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:49.240]   Working smart.
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:51.240]   That is, you have a vision for this.
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.240]   There needs to be a perspective.
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:55.240]   There needs to be something driving us forward
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:58.240]   because it's not just if you work hard, then great.
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:02.240]   There's a direction to all of this that God would want of us.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:05.240]   Here's the third and final quote that I wanted to bring up.
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.240]   "We also have to be working to prove ourselves useful
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.240]   "in the present so that we're ready
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.240]   "when the opportunity presents itself.
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.240]   "We need to prove ourselves worthy."
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:17.240]   And so the idea of this is that would work now.
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.240]   Whoa, that moved pretty quick there.
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:22.240]   Okay, so we'd work now.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.240]   That if we aren't working now,
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:28.240]   then when the time comes for us to act,
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.240]   then we won't be ready at that moment.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:33.240]   And so those were three things that I wanted us to keep in mind
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.240]   even as we go into this covenant
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:39.240]   because I think they do have a lot in common.
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.240]   So covenant number nine is,
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.240]   "I commit to the best of my ability
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:44.240]   "to advance the kingdom of God
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:48.240]   "through sharing the gospel locally and globally."
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.240]   "I commit to the best of my ability
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:51.240]   "to advance the kingdom of God
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.240]   "through sharing the gospel locally and globally."
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.240]   And so we're nearing the end of the covenants here.
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:00.240]   And this one, the words are very carefully crafted,
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.240]   I'm assuming here,
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.240]   to advance the kingdom of God.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.240]   It talks about it not just locally,
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.240]   not just globally, but both.
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.240]   Why?
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.240]   Because that's God's heart.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.240]   That's how God wants it.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.240]   Right?
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:17.240]   So then we begin by asking this question
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:19.240]   of what is evangelism?
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.240]   And what is evangelism?
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:22.240]   It's very simple, evangelion,
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:26.240]   to proclaim or to share good news.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.240]   Very, very easy.
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:29.240]   And so many of us, most of us,
[01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:32.240]   ought to be able to define what evangelism is.
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:34.240]   But when you think about the heart,
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.240]   the simplicity of this heart,
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.240]   to proclaim or share good news,
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:42.240]   is if you think of any type of good news that you've had,
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.240]   there's a sporting event where your favorite team won,
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:47.240]   or you got engaged to be married,
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:49.240]   or you want to share about the news of your child
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.240]   that's going to be born, or something like that,
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:55.240]   then it's much easier to understand
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:59.240]   the emphasis on the heart of something like evangelism.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:01.240]   This was actually just a simple word.
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:03.240]   It's a broad term.
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.240]   And it's used to show
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.240]   when there's like an announcement given
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:09.240]   that overflows from the heart.
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:12.240]   It's proclamation of good news.
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.240]   And that's all it is.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:18.240]   And so we're going to go through five different slides here,
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.240]   or five different points.
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:24.240]   And I'm going to ask a question on each of these points.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:29.240]   So the first question is, do you want to glorify God?
[01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:31.240]   And so you have to answer the question,
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.240]   do you want to glorify God?
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:34.240]   And if your answer to that is yes,
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:36.240]   then we would evangelize.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.240]   We will evangelize.
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:41.240]   If you want God to be glorified,
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:45.240]   then it has to be in the picture.
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:48.240]   But I want to ask you to think about this.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.240]   If this is actually what we think,
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:53.240]   I want to glorify God,
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:57.240]   is that the best way to just kind of go about evangelism?
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:59.240]   Oh, I want to glorify God.
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:02.240]   Or is that the best way even to live your life?
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:05.240]   That's my desire, and that's all that's needed.
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:09.240]   My desire to glorify God is enough.
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:14.240]   And I want to pose that perhaps it might not be enough
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:16.240]   unless we start asking this question,
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:19.240]   how would God be glorified?
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:24.240]   And the chapter that we read kind of talks about this a little bit.
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.240]   The Lord's work, but it's the Lord's way.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.240]   So we can't just say, I want to glorify God
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:34.240]   and dictate terms of what that means to glorify God.
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:36.240]   It has to be dictated by God himself.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:40.240]   In other words, what in fact glorifies God?
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:44.240]   There are plenty of people in this world who desire to glorify God.
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:46.240]   But is God glorified?
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.240]   How would he be glorified?
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:53.240]   That's the question each of us needs to ask ourselves.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:55.240]   So if we want to glorify God,
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:58.240]   and we try to kind of dictate the terms of that,
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.240]   it's the same thing as, I've shared this example before,
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:06.240]   but it's kind of similar to me trying to give a gift to my wife
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:09.240]   that I say, well, I liked it.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:12.240]   I thought it was kind of a practical gift.
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:14.240]   It was a cool-looking gift.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.240]   It was something that would be useful, something like that.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:21.240]   But if I don't ask the question of what would my wife actually like,
[01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.240]   then whatever gift I might give,
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:26.240]   it could be from the depths of my heart.
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:31.240]   It could be something that I genuinely think is a good thing to give.
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:34.240]   But I have to be thinking about her.
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:37.240]   And so where do we find an answer like this?
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:42.240]   Where do we find an answer to this question, how would God be glorified?
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:47.240]   It has to be found in God's Word.
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:49.240]   It has to be found in God's Word.
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:54.240]   And it can't just be lifted from pieces of text.
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:59.240]   The whole of Scriptures is going to show us how God is glorified,
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:01.240]   what would actually bring Him glory.
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:05.240]   And so this actually brings us to the second question.
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:07.240]   Do you want to do God's will?
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.240]   Not only do you want to glorify God, but do you want to do His will?
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.240]   Do you want to do what He desires?
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:17.240]   Then the answer is, then you will evangelize.
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.240]   And so we're going to do the same exercise here.
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.240]   I want to do God's will.
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.240]   If this is true to all of us,
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:28.240]   it's not enough until we ask the question of what is God's will.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:30.240]   That makes sense, right?
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:33.240]   Like if I say I want to do God's will,
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:36.240]   and then again I begin to dictate the terms of that,
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.240]   then that's not good.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:43.240]   We need to be asking what does God actually desire?
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:45.240]   What does God actually want?
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:49.240]   And so we go to the Scriptures to begin to kind of look for things, right?
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:51.240]   In 2 Peter 3, verse 8, we see,
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:54.240]   "But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved,
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.240]   that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years,
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:59.240]   and a thousand years like one day.
[01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:02.240]   The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness,
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:05.240]   but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish,
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:08.240]   but for all to come to repentance.
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.240]   But the day of the Lord will come like a thief,
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.240]   in which the heavens will pass away with a roar,
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:14.240]   and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat,
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:17.240]   and the earth and its works will be burned up."
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:19.240]   And so hidden in this, right in the middle,
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:21.240]   it says what God wishes.
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:23.240]   He does not wish for any to perish,
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:25.240]   but for all to come to repentance.
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:28.240]   That is His desire.
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:31.240]   That is what He wants.
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:35.240]   And so start thinking about this in very practical terms.
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:39.240]   Like what do you think God wants for you in your life?
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:41.240]   What would God want for me in my life?
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.240]   What would God want for Berean Community Church?
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:49.240]   What does He want for each and every individual here?
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.240]   And ask yourself that question.
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:55.240]   Do you think God's will has to do with just us
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:59.240]   becoming like a teacher, or an engineer,
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:03.240]   or furthering our careers, or something like that, right?
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:06.240]   And kind of broaden the scope of that a little bit.
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.240]   Like why--ask yourself that question.
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:13.240]   Why would God be--like His will would be so unwrapped
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:16.240]   around like a career choice, for example?
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:20.240]   But many times, I think that's how we go about it, right?
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.240]   What is God's will for me in my life?
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:25.240]   Should I like date this person, or get married to this person,
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:28.240]   or should I go like for this job, or move here?
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:29.240]   Where should I move to?
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:31.240]   What should I do with my free time?
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:32.240]   All of these kinds of things.
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:36.240]   Is that those individual islands, those individual places,
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:41.240]   is that going to be the thing that moves God's heart?
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:46.240]   And at the end of it, we would see that probably not, right?
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:48.240]   Probably not. Why?
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:51.240]   Because we know that God has told us
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.240]   that this world is passing away.
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:56.240]   Intense heat. Elements will be destroyed.
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.240]   He says interesting things.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:18:59.240]   I don't know exactly what it means,
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:01.240]   but He says there is no marriage in heaven, right?
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:04.240]   So I don't know what that means for me and Keziah.
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.240]   But at the end of the day,
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:10.240]   we know that the things that are given here in this world,
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.240]   there's a purpose to it.
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:15.240]   So do you think God's will is going to be isolated
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:18.240]   to what job that I get?
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:21.240]   The scriptures tell us a broader scope of that,
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:26.240]   a broader picture of something like that, right?
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:30.240]   Why would God's will have to be with me just finding the spouse,
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.240]   or for just having children,
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:36.240]   or limited to a world that He knows
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.240]   is going to be passing away, in other words?
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:42.240]   John Stott says that our God is a missionary God.
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.240]   That's His desire.
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.240]   That everything in scriptures is redemptive.
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:50.240]   It's pointing forward to a fact.
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:53.240]   It's pointing forward to the end.
[01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:56.240]   It's pointing forward to the reality of Christ coming back,
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:59.240]   that the heavens and the earth will pass away.
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:01.240]   And so that brings us to our third one,
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:05.240]   which is this question, do you believe in what you preach?
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:09.240]   Or do you believe in what you believe?
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:12.240]   If you do, then you will evangelize.
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:15.240]   So moving forward, 2 Corinthians 5, 6, it says,
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:17.240]   "Therefore, being always of good courage,
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:19.240]   "and knowing that while we are at home in the body,
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:21.240]   "we are absent from the Lord,
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:23.240]   "for we walk by faith, not by sight."
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:26.240]   That means that the dictation of terms
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:30.240]   is not going to be based upon me,
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:33.240]   just my fleshly desires,
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.240]   and these things that are going to be passing away.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:37.240]   And that's what tends to happen.
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:39.240]   Our eyes lock on things in this world.
[01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:41.240]   So it locks on things like career.
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:43.240]   It locks on things like family,
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:46.240]   and things that are happening just right in sight.
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:49.240]   Because these are the things that we see in the here and now.
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:52.240]   And so we become engrossed in these things.
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.240]   We lose sleep because of these things.
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.240]   We sit there and we look for counsel.
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.240]   We look for places that God will actually
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:01.240]   begin to answer these questions for us.
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:05.240]   But we can't just say, with dictation of my own terms,
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:07.240]   like, "I want to glorify God.
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.240]   "I want to do God's will."
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.240]   We have to ask, "What is God's will?
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:13.240]   "What does bring glory to God?"
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:17.240]   And so all of these things are more like vehicles
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.240]   that move us into a direction.
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:21.240]   So our spouse, our careers,
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:23.240]   the things that we do with our time,
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:26.240]   all of these things are going to be wrapped up in this, right?
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:30.240]   As Christians, we want to do what brings God glory.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:34.240]   And so we cannot get stuck on the things that are just by sight,
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.240]   because we are people who live by faith.
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:40.240]   Hebrews 11:1 says, "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for,
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:42.240]   "the conviction of things not seen,
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:47.240]   "for by it the men of old gained approval."
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:49.240]   So that's what our faith is.
[01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:51.240]   It's the assurance of things hoped for,
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:53.240]   the conviction of things that aren't seen,
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:57.240]   that we know that what we see here in this world is passing away.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:00.240]   So, for example, in 1 John 2:17, it says,
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:03.240]   "The world is passing away, and also its lusts,
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:07.240]   "but the one who does the will of God lives forever."
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:10.240]   What does that even mean?
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.240]   Well, if we believe this,
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:14.240]   we believe that the world is passing away,
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:17.240]   then we cannot get engrossed in the things of this world anymore,
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.240]   because it makes no sense to.
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:21.240]   If we believe in what we believe,
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.240]   if we believe in what we're preaching,
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.240]   then we know our houses, our cars,
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:30.240]   and our very own bodies are going to waste away.
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:33.240]   And so with something even as simple as like eating healthy,
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:36.240]   sleeping right, exercising, things like that,
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.240]   our bodies are going to die.
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:42.240]   And so we will keep it healthy inasmuch as it will what?
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:48.240]   Make us effective in this lifetime to God's purposes, right?
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.240]   And so if we get stuck on the things by sight,
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:53.240]   and we're not living by faith for the things yet unseen,
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:55.240]   then we're going to forget,
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:58.240]   and we're not going to be believing what we're preaching.
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:01.240]   And so there goes our witness.
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:06.240]   "The world is passing away, and also its lusts."
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.240]   Revelation 21.1 furthers that,
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:10.240]   "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth,
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:13.240]   "for the first heaven and the first earth passed away."
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:14.240]   If you keep reading this,
[01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:17.240]   I was tempted to kind of put out more of this text,
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:19.240]   but this text goes on to show that
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:21.240]   everything rolls away like a scroll, you know?
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:23.240]   It's like it's gone.
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:26.240]   Everything as we know it is gone.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:28.240]   And so we will evangelize.
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:31.240]   If we believe in what we're preaching,
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:35.240]   if we understand what it is that's going to actually occur,
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:38.240]   then we are going to be an evangelizing people.
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:41.240]   Number four.
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.240]   Do you love people?
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:47.240]   Then you will evangelize.
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:52.240]   If you love people, you will evangelize.
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.240]   Here's a longer one.
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:55.240]   Hebrews 12.25 says,
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:58.240]   "See to it that you do not refuse him who is speaking,
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:01.240]   "for if those did not escape when they refused him
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:02.240]   "who warned them on earth,
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:05.240]   "much less will we escape who turn away from him
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.240]   "who warns from heaven.
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:08.240]   "And his voice shook the earth then,
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:09.240]   "but now he has promised, saying,
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:10.240]   "'Yet once more I will shake it,
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:12.240]   "'shake not only the earth but also the heaven.'
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:14.240]   "This expression, 'Yet once more,'
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:17.240]   "denotes the removing of those things which can be shaken
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:18.240]   "as of created things,
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:21.240]   "so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:24.240]   "Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken,
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:27.240]   "let us show gratitude by which we may offer to God
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:29.240]   "an acceptable service with reverence and awe,
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:33.240]   "for our God is a consuming fire."
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:35.240]   And so if this is what we believe,
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:38.240]   number one, that we want to glorify God,
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:41.240]   number two, we want a desire to do his will,
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:43.240]   number three, we believe in what we are preaching,
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:46.240]   then number four, this question of do we love people
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:53.240]   is going to be brought front and center.
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:54.240]   Do you love people?
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:57.240]   If we know that all things are passing away,
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:59.240]   if we know that the end is coming,
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:00.240]   if we know that judgment is coming,
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:02.240]   and we care about people,
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:04.240]   then there is only one logical conclusion.
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:07.240]   We'll evangelize.
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:09.240]   We'll evangelize to our neighbors,
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:14.240]   our coworkers, our roommates, our family members.
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:18.240]   We'll evangelize to every person that we care about.
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:21.240]   If we're not, the natural question is,
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:25.240]   do we actually love them?
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:27.240]   Or is it that we don't believe what we're preaching?
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:30.240]   There's something broken in this line of thinking
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:34.240]   if we're not evangelizing.
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:37.240]   Matthew 9:36, "Seeing the people," this is Jesus,
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:40.240]   "he felt compassion for them because they were distressed
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:42.240]   "and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd.
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:45.240]   "Then he said to his disciples, the harvest is plentiful,
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:47.240]   "but the workers are few.
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.240]   "Therefore, beseech the Lord of the harvest
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:51.240]   "to send out workers into his harvest."
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:56.240]   Look at what draws him to call people into the service.
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:59.240]   Look at what draws him to call people into evangelism.
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.240]   It's because he looked upon them
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:04.240]   and he felt compassion on them.
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:06.240]   It was a love, love for people
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:09.240]   that actually drew him towards this.
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:12.240]   And so if we love people, we will evangelize.
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:13.240]   Just one more.
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:15.240]   Mark 10:21 says, "Looking at him,
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:17.240]   "Jesus felt a love for him."
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:18.240]   This is the rich young ruler.
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.240]   "And said to him, 'One thing you lack,
[01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:22.240]   "'go and sell all you possess and give to the poor,
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:23.240]   "'and you will have treasure in heaven.
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:24.240]   "'Come, follow me.'
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:26.240]   "But at these words he was saddened,
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:28.240]   "and he went away grieving,
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:32.240]   "for he was one who owned much property."
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:37.240]   But look at what causes Jesus to evangelize here.
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:40.240]   To go and sell all that you have.
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:41.240]   Give to the poor.
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:42.240]   You will have treasure in heaven.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.240]   Come and follow me.
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:48.240]   What draws him to that is his love for this man.
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:52.240]   So if we love people, then we will evangelize.
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.240]   All right, here's our last point, number five.
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.240]   Last question.
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:59.240]   Do you understand the purpose of the church on earth?
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:02.240]   Do you understand the purpose of the church on earth?
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:04.240]   I hope that with the reading of the book
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:06.240]   and going through these covenants,
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.240]   we know that church isn't just about,
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:10.240]   like, we come together,
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:12.240]   and then we have accountability sessions with each other,
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:14.240]   and we sing songs together,
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.240]   and listen to sermons together,
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:17.240]   and things like that, right?
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:20.240]   That there is a mission given to us.
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:22.240]   If we understand the purpose of the church,
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:24.240]   then we will evangelize.
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:26.240]   In 1 Timothy 3, 14, it says,
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.240]   "I am writing these things to you,
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:30.240]   "hoping to come to you before long.
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:31.240]   "But in case I am delayed,
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.240]   "I write so that you will know
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:36.240]   "how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God."
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:38.240]   And look at how he says it.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:40.240]   "Which is the church of the living God?"
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:43.240]   He describes the church as being the pillar
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:47.240]   and support of the truth.
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:50.240]   So this is something that when we look at our covenant,
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:55.240]   that we're committing as individuals, but together, right?
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:57.240]   That we're united in front,
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:00.240]   in sharing the gospel locally and globally,
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:02.240]   wherever God has placed us,
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:06.240]   because that is what the church is.
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:11.240]   And the church is the pillar and support of the truth.
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:13.240]   So we're very familiar.
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:16.240]   I know you knew we were gonna go through this passage today.
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:19.240]   But 11 disciples proceeded to Galilee,
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:21.240]   to the mountain which Jesus had designated.
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:23.240]   When they saw him, they worshiped him,
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:24.240]   but some were doubtful.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:26.240]   And Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying,
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:30.240]   "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:32.240]   "Go, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations,
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.240]   "baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.240]   "and the Holy Spirit,
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:37.240]   "teaching them to observe all that I commanded you.
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:41.240]   "And lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:44.240]   So this is the mission that God has left us with.
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:46.240]   When Christ left,
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:48.240]   he said that this mission is there for you
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:52.240]   to go and make disciples of Christ.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.240]   If we're not doing this,
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:55.240]   if we're not making disciples of Christ,
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:59.240]   if we're not collectively having that heart,
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:03.240]   if we're not individually being challenged,
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:04.240]   that we need to see
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:07.240]   whether our priorities are God's priorities,
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:10.240]   if our desires are God's desires,
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:14.240]   and if we actually want to bring glory to God.
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:16.240]   Like, if we want God to be glorified,
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.240]   even when we think about what is it
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:21.240]   that produces great joy in heaven,
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:26.240]   what produces such great joy in the Father,
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:29.240]   when one is brought to faith, right?
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:31.240]   That's what brings such joy to the Father.
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:34.240]   That's what makes heaven rejoice.
[01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:35.240]   And so this mission is here,
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:38.240]   and this is an expiring contract.
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.240]   This is it.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:42.240]   Whatever amount of time that we have,
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:44.240]   this is the only time
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:47.240]   we are going to be able to evangelize like this.
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:51.240]   There will be no other time in eternity for this.
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:53.240]   And so we're supposed to be consumed
[01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:57.240]   with this idea of evangelism in the here and now.
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:01.240]   We'll have plenty of time for everything else.
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:02.240]   We'll have plenty of time
[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:05.240]   to go and travel and visit places, right?
[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:08.240]   Like, some of that is so ridiculous
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.240]   because we try to find the most beautiful places
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:12.240]   that this world has to offer,
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.240]   and we know that the kingdom
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:15.240]   is going to be eternally more beautiful,
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:17.240]   eternally better,
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:19.240]   and we're going to be able to experience that.
[01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:23.240]   That's like an eternity in this kind of new heaven
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:24.240]   and new earth.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:26.240]   It's mind-boggling, isn't it?
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:29.240]   Like, each of us can spend like 1,000 years with each other
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:31.240]   and no time has gone by, you know?
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:32.240]   Like, we can do that.
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:35.240]   We can go on vacations together, I guess.
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:37.240]   Like, we have time for that.
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:40.240]   We have time to enjoy and to fellowship
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:41.240]   and all of these things.
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:43.240]   This is expiring on us.
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:45.240]   This is why God has us here.
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:48.240]   This is what the church is for.
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:50.240]   Are we sitting there asking God
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:53.240]   to present his will to us?
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:55.240]   Are we saying with empty words,
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:57.240]   "God, we want you to be glorified,"
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:59.240]   and yet we're pursuing our lives
[01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:01.240]   however way we desire,
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:03.240]   using our time in the ways
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:08.240]   that we feel like are permissible to us?
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:09.240]   Romans 10, 12,
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:11.240]   "For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek,
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.240]   "for the same Lord is Lord of all,
[01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:15.240]   "abounding in riches for all who call on him.
[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:17.240]   "For whoever will call on the name of the Lord
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:18.240]   "will be saved.
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.240]   "How then," here are the questions,
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:22.240]   "how then will they call on him
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:24.240]   "in whom they have not believed?
[01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:26.240]   "How will they believe in him whom they have not heard?
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:28.240]   "And how will they hear without a preacher?
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:30.240]   "How will they preach unless they are sent?
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:31.240]   "Just as it is written,
[01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:33.240]   "'How beautiful are the feet of those
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:35.240]   "'who bring good news of good things!'
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:37.240]   "However, they did not all heed the good news,
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:40.240]   "for Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed that report?'
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:42.240]   "So faith comes from hearing,
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:44.240]   "and hearing by the word of Christ."
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:48.240]   And we are the ones who go and take the word of Christ.
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:50.240]   We cannot be pointing to other people.
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:53.240]   We cannot be pointing to missionaries and pastors.
[01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.240]   We have to be looking at ourselves.
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:57.240]   We have to be looking at each other.
[01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:02.240]   That God has called us to this.
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:05.240]   So I was going to put this idea of evangelism
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:08.240]   being a command, because it is.
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:10.240]   But I didn't want us to leave today
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:13.240]   with this thought of evangelism being a simple duty.
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:15.240]   It is.
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:16.240]   It is our duty.
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.240]   It is a command from God.
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:20.240]   But this idea of proclamation of good news
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:24.240]   really caused me in the short 30 minutes that we have
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:26.240]   to not want to go down that path too much,
[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:30.240]   because it's supposed to be a great privilege and joy.
[01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:33.240]   We're proclaiming good news.
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:38.240]   It's supposed to be something that abounds from our hearts.
[01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:39.240]   We share the gospel.
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:40.240]   It's not just apologetics.
[01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:45.240]   It's not just trying to convince somebody of something.
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:48.240]   It's sharing of the God that we love.
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:51.240]   It's sharing the greatest thing that has ever happened to us.
[01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:55.240]   And this is a great challenge to each of us.
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.240]   Okay.
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:02.240]   Let's see.
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:03.240]   Look at verse 17.
[01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:05.240]   "For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward;
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:07.240]   but if against my will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me."
[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:10.240]   I think that's a really good way to think about this.
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:11.240]   "What then is my reward?
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:15.240]   That when I preach the gospel, I may offer the gospel without charge,
[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:17.240]   so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel."
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:21.240]   And so there's this thought that's being kind of seen here
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:25.240]   of voluntarily or stewardship.
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:27.240]   Both are proper.
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:30.240]   And I want to remind us of the fact that it's voluntary.
[01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:32.240]   All right, to conclude here,
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:35.240]   there are some misconceptions about evangelizing.
[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:37.240]   Again, as I just mentioned,
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:40.240]   some of us have a temptation to think it's for the missionaries
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:43.240]   and pastors and super Christians to do this work.
[01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:44.240]   It is not.
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:49.240]   And that's why this is part of the covenant that every member signs on to.
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:52.240]   It is not, "I will try my best," or something like that.
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:56.240]   It is, "I commit to."
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:58.240]   Very, very big difference between the two.
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:01.240]   "I commit to evangelizing."
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:07.240]   You have signed your name next to such a thing if you are a member of this church.
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:10.240]   Don't take that flippantly.
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:12.240]   It is a commitment you are making,
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:18.240]   and we are making one to another because we know this is right and true.
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:21.240]   This idea of, "I need to go on missions to do that," it's not true.
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:23.240]   "I need to be extroverted to do this," not true.
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:26.240]   "I need to be fully trained to do this," it's not true.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:29.240]   In 1 Corinthians 1:26, it says, "For consider your calling, brethren,
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:31.240]   "that there were not many wise according to the flesh,
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:33.240]   "not many mighty, not many noble,
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:36.240]   "but God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise,
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:39.240]   "God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things which are strong,
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:43.240]   "and the base things of the world and the despised God has chosen the things that are not,
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:45.240]   "so that He may nullify the things that are,
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:48.240]   "so that no man may boast before God.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:50.240]   "But by His doing," look at that.
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:52.240]   He's saying He will use us.
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:56.240]   "By His doing, you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:59.240]   "and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:03.240]   "so that just as it is written, 'Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.'"
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:14.240]   "And when it came to you, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom,
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:17.240]   "proclaiming to you the testimony of God, for I determined to know nothing among you
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:20.240]   "except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:23.240]   "I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:26.240]   "and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom,
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:29.240]   "but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:33.240]   "so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God."
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:36.240]   I hope that we're able to encourage each other with this covenant today
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:39.240]   as we go back into our discussion groups,
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:43.240]   that we're committing to the best of our ability to advance the kingdom of God
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:46.240]   through the sharing of the gospel locally and globally.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:52.240]   Be practical, encourage each other, make a habit of coming back the following week
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:56.240]   and asking, like kind of following up, even if it's real quick.
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:59.240]   I know we don't have that much time to go through all the material,
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:02.240]   but make a habit of kind of following up with each other.
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:05.240]   And so going back to the master's plan,
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:08.240]   this idea of working hard, working smart, working now,
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:11.240]   I think has everything to do with evangelism.
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:15.240]   So the Lord's work is for us to go and share the gospel,
[01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:19.240]   is to build up the church, to make disciples of Christ,
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:24.240]   and it has to be done the Lord's way, not however we dictate the terms.
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:28.240]   All right, so these are the passages, the quiet time,
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:30.240]   the devotions for this coming week.
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:33.240]   So I believe it gets kind of sent out to everybody,
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:35.240]   so if you want to take a picture of it, you can,
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:40.240]   or just wait for maybe your facilitator, your small group leader to send this to you.
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:44.240]   And these are the discussion questions.
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:46.240]   So number one, if you were to answer the question,
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:49.240]   what is God's will for my life, how would you answer it?
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:57.240]   And please don't supply the answer that the teacher is looking for kind of thing.
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:02.240]   Actually try to answer what you think, how you have been living that out right now.
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:06.240]   What have you been supplying as an answer to that?
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:08.240]   What is God's will for my life?
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:10.240]   What is it that we've been praying?
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:12.240]   When we pray, we're praying God's will.
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:15.240]   Whatever we think God's will is at least.
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:17.240]   So ask that question, answer that for one another.
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:19.240]   How would you answer it? Why?
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:22.240]   And how does evangelism fit into your answer?
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:24.240]   If that is in fact the mission that he gave us,
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:28.240]   with the answer that we give, where does evangelism fit into that?
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:30.240]   Number two, what are some comfort zones that you have roped off in your life
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:32.240]   that prevents you from faithfully evangelizing?
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:35.240]   So this is a place I think we could try to encourage each other.
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:39.240]   What are some places, let's reveal the places where we've kept hidden
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:41.240]   because we're afraid, you know?
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:45.240]   Like home, or work, or clubs, or old friends, or whatever.
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:48.240]   Whatever thing that we're a part of.
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:50.240]   I don't know, you can figure that out.
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:54.240]   What exactly is it that might cause you to veer away from sharing the gospel with them?
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:56.240]   Number three, how do you continue to share the gospel
[01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:58.240]   to someone you have already shared the gospel to?
[01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:01.240]   Someone that you have shared the gospel to multiple times already.
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:04.240]   And so, share some ideas, tips, and encouragements.
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:06.240]   Maybe even discouragements.
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:09.240]   Sometimes, your discouragement is my encouragement.
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:11.240]   You know what I'm talking about?
[01:38:11.240 --> 01:38:14.240]   When someone's sharing something hard they're going through,
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:16.240]   you're like, "I don't know why I'm so encouraged right now."
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:21.240]   So, use that to propel each other, okay?
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:24.240]   We'll use good things and bad things to propel each other.
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:27.240]   So, especially in this thing of like,
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:30.240]   let's try not to do the hit and run type of gospel.
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:33.240]   If there are people that we've already shared the gospel with,
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:37.240]   let's persevere, and let's kind of encourage each other in those things.
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:41.240]   All right, let me close this in prayer.
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:46.240]   Heavenly Father, I pray, God, that you would help us to move.
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:48.240]   God, to apply.
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:53.240]   Father, that your spirit would awaken and enliven within us
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:57.240]   a real desire to do your will, to live for your glory.
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:00.240]   God, teach us your heart.
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:05.240]   And Father, show us, remind us how much you loved us.
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:07.240]   That you are a missionary, God.
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:10.240]   And Father, that the time here is short.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:13.240]   That it might cause us to grow urgent, even in our love,
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:15.240]   for those that you've sent around us.
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:18.240]   Thank you, God. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:36.240]   [silence]
