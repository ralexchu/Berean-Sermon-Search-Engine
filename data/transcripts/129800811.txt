[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   I
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:11.340]   Lehman and I'm gonna be reading from verse 4 through 10 filemen verse 4 through 10
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:21.760]   Reading out of the ESV
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.600]   I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.240]   Toward the Lord Jesus and for all the Saints and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.920]   Of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.100]   For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love my brother because the hearts of the Saints have been refreshed through you
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.520]   Accordingly though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required yet for love's sake
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.360]   I prefer to appeal to you. I Paul an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.480]   I appeal to you for my child onesimus whose father I became in I became in my imprisonment. Let's pray
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.440]   Gracious and loving father we thank you so much for this morning
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.920]   We asked Lord God that what proceeds from this pulpit would be your words
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.360]   That your children would hear your voice and follow you
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.400]   Protect us Lord God from wrong thinking
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.020]   That we may have right application. I
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.240]   Pray that through this time your church may be sanctified that your word may be preached and Christ may be exalted
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.320]   We pray for your blessing and your presence with us in Jesus name. We pray. Amen
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.200]   Yeah, as you guys know
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.120]   Like we talked about last week
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.200]   you know the book of Philemon is a powerful book not because it has an exposition of the gospel or
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.360]   Or tells us the details about what propitiation is and all of these things are very essential to our faith
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.000]   But at the core of it it is the proof of the power of the gospel
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.920]   You know we can talk about
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.240]   How precious Jesus is and we can exposit scripture and know what the verses mean and and all the systematic theology
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.560]   But if there is no power all it becomes after a while just religious talk
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.620]   It doesn't have any practical effect in our lives
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.360]   It doesn't affect the way that we make decision or we raise our children. The gospel was meant to be powerful
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.160]   Not just something to be regurgitated not just something for us to hold on to for security blanket
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.040]   But to challenge us to flip our world upside down
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:37.880]   That's what Philemon is Philemon is a testimony of how the gospel has changed the lives of these particular these three men
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.440]   Now we know the author Paul he's writing this letter in prison
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.580]   and
[00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.580]   You know we try to
[00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.300]   Sociologists always try to explain why the Christianity grew so fast and why so many people embrace Christianity
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.720]   2,000 years ago, and they'll try to put a psychological sociological
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.580]   Economical spin to it say maybe the poor people are attracted because Jesus promised riches
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.420]   You know maybe maybe the people who had nothing it was a way Avenue for them to gain something
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.440]   But you look at Paul's life. It doesn't fit any of that
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.800]   Paul is a man who was made possibly a member of the Sanhedrin
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.400]   leaders of one of the Senate's
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.560]   senators
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.140]   He was already come from a very rich family
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.520]   it was a Roman citizen and he lost all of that because he became a Christian and
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.460]   Now he's sitting in prison and instead of worrying about himself
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:38.960]   He's not writing a letter concerned about this runaway slave that he may be restored back to his former master as a brother
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.940]   So again, you look at the life of Paul and in the very author of this letter
[00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.300]   You see the power of the cross in his life. You see on estimates a runaway slave
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.780]   you know, he became a Christian as
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.800]   Apostle Paul sitting in prison and continue to share the gospel with him and
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.040]   For him to go back to where he came from. I mean he escaped
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.800]   Imagine he risked his life. He risked everything to leave behind all of that and then he came out now
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.040]   Because he met Christ he's going back
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.760]   now
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.840]   Philemon had every legal right to put him in prison to beat him to to to mark him as a runaway slave
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.480]   Telling everybody the whole world. This is a this is a man that you cannot trust
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.440]   and so only reason why
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.980]   Onesimus would even return is because he'd been deeply affected by the cross
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:37.180]   Same thing with Philemon. Why would this man who who lost a great deal because of this runaway slave?
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.940]   We even receive him
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.020]   What did he have to gain for doing this?
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.660]   So Philemon even though it's a very short letter only have 25 verses
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.200]   It is a powerful testimony of what happens when people are affected by the cross
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.420]   Basically Philemon is a letter about forgiveness
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.100]   It's about forgiving those who's trespassed against you
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.580]   The idea of forgiving somebody is not natural to us
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.020]   You know how often have you fantasized?
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.980]   Like somebody in the past who've wronged you maybe they said something to you. Maybe they cheated you in business
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:22.740]   You know how often have you thought and fantasize man if I were to go back in time and and if I was to do
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:29.460]   Something differently how often they have he's fantasized about taking vengeance on that person and and seeking justice. We rarely sit around
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:36.220]   Fantasizing about being gracious. You know I go back and I should have been more gracious in that situation
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.380]   I think that's why if you look at majority of the action movies at the core of the action movies
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.380]   There is this idea of vengeance
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.380]   right
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.620]   You just going out and blowing up stuff isn't fun. You have to blow up people who wronged you so
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.700]   Usually the action movie begins by somebody being wronged
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:05.660]   Right your family is killed or something's taking you know like somebody's taking hostage or something happens whether it's personal or whether it happens
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.660]   As a government level and then the rest of the movie is trying to pay back
[00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.820]   Right and I think there was a movie called payback, right?
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.300]   Think about some of the movies maybe some of I don't know to me. This is new and fresh
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.020]   So - I don't know if it is to you, but gladiator
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.100]   V for vendetta is this new
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:32.900]   Kill Bill, I just looked up online to see okay count of Monte Cristo
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.900]   I don't I didn't see that but I read it and it was about vengeance
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.940]   quantum solace
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.780]   by James Bond movie
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:46.500]   Man on fire and I can go on and on and on if you basically Google and look at action movies the basic you know the
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:53.380]   The outline of it is somebody is wrong, and then they're gonna pay them back right. That's a natural human response
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.100]   to ask somebody to forgive somebody and
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.620]   to get nothing back
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.100]   it's
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.900]   It's not natural because that's not how we function
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.700]   In fact just yesterday
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:07.460]   I was
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.820]   driving my car in a parking lot
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.420]   you know and I was putting air my tire and then I was in a hurry to get out of the parking lot and and
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:20.100]   I made a left turn and this guy it's kind of stepped out and he wasn't he wasn't right in front of the car
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:25.580]   I would say the distance was probably from here to maybe about that door and I saw him come out and so I could have
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:30.900]   Easily just kind of went by him, but I stopped the car and I waved toward I was being gracious. It's like okay
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:37.100]   You know go you know and I'll wait for you so as he was crossing. He was mumbling something
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.860]   So I thought in my mind. I was like oh, he's saying. Thank you. Thank you for being gracious and letting me go
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:47.260]   But as as I was going he was saying something that I cannot repeat
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.900]   He was looking straight at me. He was cursing me out, and I was like what?
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.620]   You know I just I was so gracious to let him go
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:00.740]   And I remember as he was passing by I was watching like what why would you be what I don't get it
[00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:07.260]   Like I was just letting you pass and and somehow I don't know what the miscommunication was but something was
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.660]   Miscommunicated and he got mad and he started cussing at me
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.660]   And then he walked into the store and as I was driving off. I was thinking what just happened here I
[00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.340]   Was allowing him to pass by and then I got cussed out for it
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:26.320]   And the whole way that I was going to I was going to the girls softball tournament and the whole drive down
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.580]   I was thinking what is wrong with this guy
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.660]   You know and I just I tried to like we are gonna listen to sermon and turn on Christian radio
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.500]   But I just couldn't get it out of my head. What is wrong with this guy right?
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.700]   You know in the back of my mind. I'm thinking man if I wasn't a pastor
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.580]   What should I what would I have done if I wasn't a pastor?
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.420]   If I wasn't a Christian what if I got out of my car and scared this guy?
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:51.100]   I'm thinking that all this scenario and even all the way down to softball
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:56.340]   I was thinking like Peter you're Christian calm down tomorrow. You're gonna be talking about forgiveness
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.580]   You better calm down
[00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.860]   It's just humanly speaking
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.260]   That's not natural our natural response isn't forgiveness
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:10.820]   and that's why when God says to nation of Israel I for an eye tooth for tooth is not a
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.760]   Formula to carry out vengeance is to withhold our vengeance
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.860]   Because our natural response if you take my eyes, I'm gonna rip your head off
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.280]   Right you can teach you never to mess with me
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:30.180]   See this letter here in Philemon what Paul is asking Philemon to do is supernatural
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:36.440]   Because what he's asking him to do is here's this runaway slave at the minimum was financially
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.660]   He robbed from him at the minimum. It may have been may have been embarrassing for him
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.940]   You know imagine what that would have done
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.540]   Maybe I don't know if he did it before he was a before Philemon became a Christian or not
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:52.700]   But whatever it was it's clear that he was the one who was wronged
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.700]   and on estimates was the one who wronged him and
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:02.980]   Paul is not saying if you receive him back, you know, he's gonna pay you back
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.020]   You know, he wronged you maybe he owes you a hundred grand
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.420]   He's gonna work his tail off and he's gonna give you everything that he has if you can forgive him
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.380]   Paul's not asking any of that Paul says forgive him
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:18.420]   In other words he's saying just drop it just humanly speaking
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:26.980]   Just drop it. In fact, not only just drop it you lost him as a runaway slave, but now would you please receive him as
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.700]   a brother in Christ
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.700]   To love him like you are loving the other brothers in the church
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:40.060]   Humanly speaking it's impossible. How can we possibly even dare to ask somebody expect that of somebody?
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:45.460]   But at the core of what you and I believe is about forgiveness
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:51.060]   At the very core of why we are here. It's about forgiveness
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:59.340]   Ephesians 4 32 says be kind to one another tender-hearted forgiving one another as God in Christ forgave you
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:04.580]   In essence, that's that's the core of the gospel
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.660]   Because he forgave us
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.180]   Now you forgive each other
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:19.020]   Again in Colossians 3 13 is his bearing with one another if one has a complaint against another forgive each other as the Lord has
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.500]   Forgiven you so you also must forgive
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.700]   We all know love that passage in Romans 5 8
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:32.020]   Where it says God demonstrates his own love toward us while we were yet sinners Christ died for us
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:37.060]   In a part of the reason why it's so difficult for us to forgive is
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:45.900]   Because we tend to see other sins other people's sins greater than ours, you know, we always say well
[00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:50.260]   You know, I'm not perfect but that guy and that's usually when somebody says I'm not perfect
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:57.900]   But that guy that's kind of a setup to like I'm justified in hating that person. I know I'm not perfect, but that guy deserves this
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.320]   You know, I think part of the reason why
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.500]   athletic superstars don't make good coaches is
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:10.100]   Because they're superstars and they can't stand mediocrity, you know
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:15.700]   And so because they function at such a high level when they're coaching other people who are kind of on the average
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.540]   You know, they don't have the patience or the grace to to build them up
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.980]   So you don't perform this up to here. I can't have you
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.220]   But here's a problem
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.420]   Spiritually, there's not one Michael Jordan
[00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.980]   No, Kobe Bryant's
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.460]   The scripture says all have sin and fall short in the glory of God
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.300]   but the problem is
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:44.580]   We don't really see that the gravity of what it is that Christ has saved us from
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:54.540]   Because the motivation and the power to forgive others comes from understanding the forgiveness that Christ has given us
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:00.420]   So when we don't understand the gravity of where we stood before God and where we are without him
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.660]   It is difficult to be forgiving
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.500]   Because it just sounds like take it
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.180]   Just forgive just drop just drop it
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:16.620]   One of the scripture says that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us, you know, typically, you know
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.000]   If you've been at a Bible teaching church for a while
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.240]   You know that the most common word for sin is hamartian and what does hamartian mean?
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.940]   Yeah, I hear mumbling but I hear
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:34.900]   to miss the mark right and again if you've been a Christian for all you already know that the basic meaning of
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.860]   Sin means to miss the mark
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:43.860]   But in and of itself we don't get the gravity of what that word means because it just sounds like you know
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.860]   We were shooting at something and we missed
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.620]   It doesn't sound too bad
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.220]   Right. It's kind of like when you were at school
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:57.060]   you tried so hard to get an a and you stayed up all night and you worked and you studied and you
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.620]   Turned in your paper on time and you got a B
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.180]   It doesn't sound that bad
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.620]   It's just we just couldn't do it like I was trying to stay on this path
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.160]   But I fell asleep and I just kind of fell off and I missed the mark
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.540]   See we have to understand what mr
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.100]   Mark is in a context of what the scripture says about what sin is
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:20.780]   In fact, if you look at scripture, there are more than 40 different words used to describe sin
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:24.060]   The most common word is hamartian in the Greek
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.580]   But when we examine these words
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:32.780]   It gives us a broader and deeper picture of what it is that we have been saved from
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:38.140]   And I'm just gonna go over a few words with you because we're not gonna sit here and go through all 40
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:43.420]   In Hebrew, there's a word called Raha, which means wicked or evil
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.940]   anything that goes against God's nature is
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.460]   Raha or
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:54.740]   Avon it means to be crooked or twisted and the root word means to be perverted
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:15:01.420]   It doesn't it doesn't just mean that we shot for something and we missed it. It means that there's a perversion
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:07.020]   There's something crooked inside of who we are for sure. The word means to rebel
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:14.460]   It's not just somebody who was walking the narrow path and then just stepped on something or tripped over something
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:19.580]   It is a willful rebellion to shake your fist at God's a I don't want you
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.540]   That's the word for sure
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.740]   another word a sham to be offensive
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.940]   To offend him. We didn't just mr
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:36.560]   Mark, we didn't just live up to a certain standard that he had the scripture says that we were offensive the word ha ha
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.560]   In Hebrew, it means to deliberately deceive to hide
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:46.720]   Because we want to go this path and God says to go here and so we would deceive
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.080]   Deceive ourselves deceive others and deceive God
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:57.940]   See that in Hebrew the word for sin is not simply we just missed the mark. It means there's wickedness
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:03.860]   There's badness corruptness in our nature. There's perversion. There's a willful rebellion
[00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.060]   There's offensiveness to this God and we deceive to hide all of this
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:12.420]   In the Greek the word Martian again to mr. Mark
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:17.620]   But perhaps basis basis is to violate something
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:25.720]   Whenever somebody is wronged, you know was L we've been sinned against but when it's when it's been really perverted when it was really deep
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.000]   And offensive we say that person has been violated
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.820]   Well, that's the word in Greek
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.860]   another word for sin to violate a
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.740]   Sabia
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.740]   ungodly
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.580]   Ponras diseased
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:46.540]   Corrupted in nature Kakos depraved
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:50.060]   Adhikas
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.060]   unjust
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.340]   anomos
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:57.500]   To have no law lawlessness plana to go astray
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:04.260]   These are some of the words that describe sin and when the scripture says all have sin and fall short of the glory of God
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.220]   He's not just saying that we tried but we couldn't make it
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:13.340]   The Bible describing a willful rebellion against God. I don't want you as my God
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:19.140]   I'd rather experience this pleasure now than to submit myself to you
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.980]   Deliberately rebelling deliberately offensive
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.820]   disease in our nature and
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:32.180]   That's why Romans chapter 3 verse 10 when it says no one seeks God. No one does good
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:36.780]   It seems like an exaggeration but in reality, that's what the scripture says we were
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.580]   when we don't understand the degree of
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:46.360]   Sin that we were seeped in that he saved us from that's why the Bible describes us
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:54.060]   It describes us as dead in our trespasses not just sick not just corrupted but dead in our trespasses
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:18:00.500]   There's nothing that we could have done to move out of there. It was it was a we're so deep into this quicksand
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:04.380]   There was nothing that we could have grasped by ourselves that we could have come out
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:10.220]   He says so when the scripture says God demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.740]   sinners yet depraved yet
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:16.000]   Wicked yet in rebellion
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.580]   Christ died for us. I
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:23.780]   Think the more we live
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:31.820]   You know what it means to grow as a as a Christian is to recognize what it is that we have in Christ
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.900]   And the deeper we recognize what we have in Christ
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:41.980]   We give a reasonable response. So everything that we give to God is a response
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:45.820]   It's not something that we we muster up within
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:49.140]   It's not something that if we meditate enough if we memorize scripture
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.780]   It is simply a reaction towards some seeing something and experience something
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:19:00.160]   Beyond ourselves and that's why Romans chapter 12 in view of God's mercy. It says
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.060]   Presents your body as a living sacrifice
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:10.100]   You know Luke chapter 18 11th 14, you know that password Jesus is basically rebuking the Pharisee for his self-righteousness
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.380]   And this is what he says
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:17.240]   The Pharisee standing by himself prayed thus God. I thank you that I am NOT like other men
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:22.000]   extortioners unjust adulterers or even like this tax collector
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.480]   Before we judge the Pharisee too quickly
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:29.980]   Everything he said was true in this passage. He didn't extort
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.300]   He he was not an extortioner
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.940]   He was an obeyer of the law. He kept it so precisely
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.380]   He memorized scripture
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:45.180]   Jesus said that they would travel miles and miles just to proselytize people
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:49.860]   He prayed and he gave and he was at the temple constantly
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:55.100]   So on the surface everything he says was true. He was not an extortioner. He was not unjust
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:02.300]   He wasn't he was not an adulterer and he wasn't like the tax collector. He didn't betray his country
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.220]   He wasn't going around and taking money from people unjustly
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.780]   so on the surface
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:11.260]   He can look at it. We can look at that and says yeah, I mean what he's saying is true
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.860]   He but the corruption is much deeper than that
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:22.660]   You look at this tax collector in verse 12 is I fast twice a day or he he himself the Pharisee said I face twice
[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:27.260]   I said that I give tithes all that I get in verse 13, but the tax collector standing far off
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:34.500]   Would not even lift up his eyes to heaven but beat his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:41.100]   Our relationship with God begins when we recognize that that's me
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:44.340]   That's me. I'm that sinner
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.300]   I'm the one who rebelled against God
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:52.380]   I'm the one who's constantly wanting to deceive. I'm the one who's going astray
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.940]   I'm the one who was not deserving of this grace and
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:59.300]   He forgave me
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:04.140]   Peter asked a question in Matthew 18 21 to 35
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.980]   Peter says
[00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:12.920]   Lord, how often will my brother sin against me and I forgive him as many as seven times?
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.580]   Now, I know you guys know that passage. I
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.740]   don't think Peter was asking a
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.860]   hypothetical question I
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:27.500]   Think he was wronged now. I don't know who it might have been James. It might have been John maybe Judas
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:33.100]   You know, it might have been maybe people from the outside, but I think Peter was genuinely wronged
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.100]   And he was probably thinking to himself
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.740]   I'm not gonna be stepped on anymore
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:44.700]   How can I possibly just let this go probably Jesus kept on telling him like what do I do with this guy this guy?
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:49.760]   You know every time we cook fish we come back and he eats all of it, you know
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.180]   Like this guy this guy is just so insensitive
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:56.500]   You know the things that he says all the time
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.580]   He's not aware of what he's saying what he's doing
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.500]   and so Peter was probably wrong and he was probably asking this question because
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:06.740]   Every time he came to Jesus Jesus said to him forgive him
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.700]   So I believe it's in that context not knowing
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.300]   Exactly what it was
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:17.000]   He's actually a personal practical question
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.700]   How often do you really expect me to forgive them?
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:25.940]   All right. So again, it was not hypothetical. He's not asking a broad theological question
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:33.180]   He's just asking do you really expect me to forgive them this many times and Jesus says and he says seven times again seven times
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:38.680]   Being like, okay, you know, I've already given them forgiving them three times because you kept on telling me up to seven times
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:43.920]   That's not human, but you're the Messiah. So we're gonna live a higher standard, but seven times
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:50.780]   Jesus's response to him said I do not say to you seven times but 70 times seven
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:55.260]   It doesn't record for us Peter's response
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.940]   But you could imagine what Peter was probably thinking
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:06.340]   You know up to seven time. Okay, I said seven because you know, I'm already I'm already up to here with this guy, you know
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:15.380]   Three times four times. Okay, seven times maybe because you're from God. You're the Messiah, you know, but 70 times seven
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:21.620]   It doesn't say anything there's there's no response from Peter and he probably was dumbfounded
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:30.180]   But Jesus responds to him in that answer and he gives him the why this is reasonable
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:37.620]   Completely unreasonable in any other circumstance to expect any of you who've been wrong to forgive seven times
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:44.920]   Completely unreasonable. I would never ask that of you, but that's exactly what Jesus says and then he gives a reasoning behind it
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:50.720]   And you know the parable he gives a story about his this man who old this King
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:55.620]   10,000 talents and he could not possibly pay this back
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:02.280]   So he begs for mercy and so the king decides to show mercy to him and he allows him to go
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.840]   completely free and
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:12.360]   Then he goes back home and then here's another servant that comes to him and he owes him a hundred denarii and he same situation
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.520]   Except this this time. He's the one who was wrong and he asked for forgiveness
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.840]   He said how can I forgive you you have to pay me back?
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:25.080]   And if you don't I'm gonna put you in jail and that's what he practices in it end of it
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.080]   Jesus says you wicked servant
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:33.160]   You've been forgiven ten thousand talents and you couldn't forgive him a hundred denarii
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:40.080]   Now in order to understand the gravity of what he is saying, you have to understand the amount that he's talking about
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:48.080]   He's not talking about ten thousand talents like what he he forgave you ten thousand dollars and this guy only if only have a hundred
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.880]   dollars a
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:55.840]   Single talent was equivalent to 20 years of an average laborers pay
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.560]   Okay, 20 years
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.600]   Average laborers pay now. I'm not gonna do the math
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.480]   Okay, cuz I'm gonna be mocked for it at the end no matter how hard I work
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:10.800]   I it's probably not gonna come out right you do the math. Okay, it comes out to somewhere near in
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.080]   hundreds of millions
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.520]   Okay
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.520]   Maybe a billion
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:23.400]   But it's a ridiculous amount of money for an average worker. Imagine if one talent is 20 years of pay
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.440]   At minimum even if he's getting a little bit
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:34.240]   We're talking in the millions versus a denarii one denarii is one day's pay
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.160]   So he owes a hundred denarii
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.520]   Right, so we're talking about
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.840]   20 years times
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.680]   10,000 okay
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.960]   20 years of pay times
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.320]   10,000 10,000 times 20. Okay, you do the math
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:58.160]   Okay, I I think it's in it's in the hundreds of millions possibly in the billions of dollars
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:04.560]   And here's this guy a few thousand bucks, right? Why does Jesus use this analogy?
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:09.800]   I mean, it seems like an exaggeration say, you know, the early early Jews at that time were very temperamental
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.200]   So instead of instead of saying he owed a couple hundred thousand and then and a few thousand
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.120]   He said a billion dollars and a few thousand dollars
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.560]   Was he simply exaggerating? I
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.720]   Don't think he was for the purpose of exaggeration I
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.160]   Think Jesus was trying to teach Peter
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:33.280]   You don't understand the debt that has been forgiven you
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:42.520]   Because you don't recognize the debt that has been forgiven you you have a difficult time for even the debt that others have on you
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:48.120]   Everything that we talked about
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:54.640]   The violation the ungodliness that disease that depraved the unjust the lawless go going astray
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.040]   Every part of this is a description of who we are
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:02.040]   And that's why universalism is so so offensive to God
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:07.440]   I mean you can we can understand why it would be so offensive if there was any other possible way
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:14.000]   That a sinner could pay his debt to enter into heaven. Would he have sent his only begotten Son?
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.240]   Wouldn't he have allowed you to at least at least give it a try
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:27.720]   The only reason why the Son of God would come was so that because the debt was so big
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.280]   That another human being could not possibly pay that debt
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.980]   My life could not possibly pay for your life
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.640]   My debt could not be canceled by yours
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:44.960]   Only way that this debt could have been paid if the Son of God
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.240]   Absorbed all of it upon himself
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.480]   Think about the magnitude of
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.540]   How deep our sin must have been?
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:00.080]   that the God of the universe that everything was created by him and for him and
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:06.400]   Everything is sustained by him. Look at the size of this universe that he who created all of this
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:13.400]   Did not consider equality with God something to be grasped and came and became nothing for what?
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.400]   to pay our debt
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.960]   God demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet sinners
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.280]   Christ died for us
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:31.760]   It is because we do not recognize what it is that we have in Christ we have such a hard time
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:36.440]   With forgiving others. That's why Jesus says I'm telling you seven times seventy
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:44.760]   Because you don't realize what was has been done for you seven times seventy doesn't begin to describe what you have in Christ
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:50.880]   Not seven times seventy seven thousand times seven thousand would not describe
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.840]   What the God of the universe did for us
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:29:01.880]   See Paul is not telling this to file a man because file a man was not a good Christian and he wasn't practicing grace
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:05.680]   In fact Paul described file a man as a great man
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.320]   practicing great love file a man
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:14.280]   Verse five because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and all the Saints
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.640]   Again in verse seven for I have derived much joy and comfort from your love my brother
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.840]   Because the hearts of the Saints have been refreshed through you
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:27.000]   So he's not telling this to file a man because he wasn't a good Christian. He wasn't practicing this grace
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   He said you need to practice some of this grace
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.400]   Says no, just like he says to find the Philippines 1 9 and it is my prayer that your love may abound
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.680]   more and more with knowledge and all discernment
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.840]   More and more
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:48.880]   Wait, I don't know about you. But when I read that and skim through it and I say I know you're practicing love
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.720]   But it's not enough that you practice more and more
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.520]   I mean, oh my gosh, it sounds like you know
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:02.600]   Your child is working hard and he came home with an a and he says I'm thankful that you're getting an a but a plus
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.600]   a plus
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.080]   You come up with the four point three GPA. He's like the four point five
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.640]   four point five is your goal, right and
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:16.360]   That's what it may sound like if you don't really understand what he is saying
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:20.780]   He says it again in Thessalonians 4 9 through 10. Here's this model church
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:29.260]   Concerning brotherly love you have no need for anyone to write to you for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:37.340]   For that indeed is what you are doing to all the brothers throughout Macedonia, but we urge you brothers to do this more and more
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:41.060]   You know almost kind of like hey Paul back off
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:44.140]   These guys are being persecuted
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:48.460]   They're sacrifice. They've already sacrificed so much and they're model Christians
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:56.540]   And he says your love is being proclaimed all throughout Macedonia when they talk about a church that loves one another they talk about you
[00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:02.460]   But Paul says it is not enough to do this more and more
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:06.940]   Now again if we leave it right here it says okay go do it
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:13.420]   Right, whatever you have whatever you bro, whatever righteousness that you think you have whatever love and grace you're practicing great
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.020]   We commend you for it, but do more and more
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:22.020]   We need to understand what he is saying first of all, he says Thessalonians
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:26.300]   I don't have I don't have a need to tell you this because God himself is teaching you this
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.580]   He's not I don't think he's saying that they had some special
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:33.340]   Revelation that the other churches didn't have that God was audibly speaking to them
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.220]   That the other Christians were not hearing
[00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:43.260]   When he says I don't need to teach you about this because God has already taught you he's talking about their own salvation
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:51.540]   At the very nature of what we proclaim every song that we sing every passage that we read
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.620]   It's about his great love for us
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:32:01.700]   That's why John says in John 1st John 3 1 see what kind of love the Father has given us
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:05.340]   That we should be called the children of God and that's what we are
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.740]   In some of you in a NASB translations
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:14.620]   It says behold, you know because the word seed just kind of sees like I see this I see that but really is
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.900]   the word really
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.380]   captures to take a minute to take a look and
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.300]   examine
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.180]   behold
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.180]   What manner of love is this?
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:30.940]   That we will be called the children of God and that's exactly what we are
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:34.420]   How often have you fantasized
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:38.620]   About being Bill Gates son or daughter
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:41.380]   All right. I think I can use Bill Gates because
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.060]   Most of this crowd is younger, right?
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:49.940]   Thinking if I was Bill Gates son, I could fly to Europe anytime I want
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:52.500]   You know, I
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:56.860]   Could go to the Himalayas. I don't have to go to school. I have to wake up to go to work
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.500]   How many times have you fantasized every time you didn't want to go to work?
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.940]   And I only if he was my father
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.500]   You know, I could do this and I could do that and
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:09.020]   Yet the scripture says
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.860]   Behold take a look
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:16.940]   What manner of love is this that we are called the children of the Almighty God?
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:23.500]   How foolish and short-sighted are we that we would sit and fantasize about being a
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:27.020]   son of somebody who has riches that will fade
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.220]   When we have the riches of heaven
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.700]   waiting for us in eternity
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:39.900]   That's why he says behold what manner of love is this it is not any special revelation that the Thessalonians God
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.300]   It was a revelation that every Christian has
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:48.020]   Every single Christian who confesses Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior behold
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:54.860]   What manner of love is this that you are here and able to understand what is being preached this morning
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:34:00.860]   Behold what manner of love is this that you can pray and the God of the universe listens to you
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:03.260]   Why does he listen to you?
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:09.540]   Why does he care about you? Why does he care about me? What manner of love is this?
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:13.540]   Because we have potential because we were better looking
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:17.140]   While we were yet sinners he did this for us
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:22.580]   Ephesians 3 17 19 says that you being rooted and grounded in love
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:29.940]   May have strength to comprehend with all the saints that what is the breadth and length and height and depth and to know the love
[00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:33.980]   Of Christ that surpasses knowledge that you may be filled with all the fullness of God
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:41.700]   You know again on the surface may look like yeah, that's great but he wants us to do more and more at what point do we
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:43.340]   Get to rest
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:48.380]   Well, I what point is it enough? I name it was already practicing all this but he says do more more
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:53.980]   Again, if we understand it superficially we make we may actually leave burdened by this
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.860]   but look what he says in verse 6 and
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.140]   I pray
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:05.020]   That the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:11.580]   Christ I used to think that when he says the sharing of your faith may become effective. I thought he's talking about evangelism
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:21.100]   But in reality the word sharing here in Greek is corn on Nia where we get the word partnership or fellowship and in the context
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.380]   He's not talking about evangelism
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:28.900]   He's not all of a sudden talking about forgiving your brother practicing love and then say now evangelism. All right, it wouldn't fit the context
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:35.780]   What he is saying is as a Christian to practice the faith that you profess
[00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:42.660]   The love that Christ poured out upon you when you are practicing this grace and you are practicing this love
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:45.980]   That it may be effective powerful
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:51.700]   For the full knowledge look at here. I want you to pay attention to this because this is the key
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:55.220]   That you would practice this grace and this love
[00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:03.460]   So that it may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:10.220]   The word for full knowledge here is not talking about something study that you go to seminary and you study about
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:14.700]   The gospel you study about some knowledge. He's talking about experientially
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:21.620]   The full knowledge and understanding of what it is that you have in Christ when you are practicing this love
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:27.020]   And I can honestly tell you that the most difficult thing about
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:30.860]   Ministry has not been money
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:34.860]   You know somebody say I've you've been on pass. It must be hard financially
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:38.860]   I mean, I don't know too many pastors who come into ministry thinking I'm gonna be rich
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:43.940]   Right, and if they are they stand out like a sore thumb, you know right away
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.940]   You can tell and not to say that there isn't temptation for it
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:50.420]   But I don't know too many people coming into ministry thinking that they're gonna make money
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:55.700]   So when we have financial hardship, it's you know, we were prepared for that
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:00.260]   The hardest part of our ministry is loving people. That's hard to love and
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:03.220]   That to be honest
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:07.900]   Ministry forces you to but that's not about that's not ministry. That's just being a Christian
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:11.620]   Ministry just have extra because people are watching
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.500]   You know, you're a pastor you have to
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.980]   Even as I was preparing for this, you know, I have to think about it
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:22.220]   What am I think I'm struggling with you know that make sure that I don't come up here as a hypocrite
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.760]   So this is extra accountability for me, you know
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:34.220]   But the practice of love and grace and forgiveness is not human
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:40.500]   It's not something that I search deeper than go to the closet and really like, you know
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:46.620]   Practice yoga and tap into this inner being and then when I tap into it, it's like I love everybody
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.940]   You know
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:51.820]   The deeper I dig the more vengeance I want
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:56.340]   The more I think about it the more undeserving these people are
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:59.100]   the deeper I dig
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.880]   It causes me to come before the Lord and recognize
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:07.900]   If it's this hard to love a fellow brother
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:11.540]   A fellow sister and
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:16.820]   It wasn't it's not even that offensive. It's just it doesn't take a sinful human being
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:18.820]   It doesn't take much to trigger us
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:24.060]   Right all in all I said, oh they said they said what about me what?
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.900]   They didn't like my tie what?
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.340]   You
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:31.620]   Cook some food and they thought it was too salty what?
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:38.220]   That guy it doesn't take much for us to do if it's this hard for me to love
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:41.100]   another brother in Christ
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:46.060]   How much did it take for God of the universe
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.060]   To have pity on me
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:56.540]   That he would leave a whole of that to come walk among us in this filth
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:39:01.620]   So that while we were yet sinners not because we were running to him
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:06.660]   Not because we were running to him and he was trying to catch us. He jumped into the mud
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.860]   that we were unwilling to come out of
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:14.140]   And that's why he says
[00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:20.140]   See the sharing of your faith the practice of this faith this grace this love
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:26.780]   That he would become effective so that you would have the full knowledge of every good thing that you have in Christ
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:29.620]   And the more we practice this love
[00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:35.980]   The more we recognize what it is that we have in Christ and the more we recognize what we have in Christ
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.300]   The more we're able to practice this grace and the more we have
[00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:46.180]   able to practice this grace the more we're able to know his love and this cycle goes on and on and it gets us deeper
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:48.980]   And deeper in understanding of what it is that we have in Christ
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:52.860]   So you may say thank you today and you may say thank you tomorrow
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:57.980]   But the thank you that you say every single year is deeper and deeper and deeper
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:03.940]   Because we recognize just how far we are without him
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:09.940]   When I first got saved I loved I loved the fact that he loved and he died for me
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.940]   I'm who wouldn't love this guy
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.380]   But every year that I live I
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.420]   See the darkness in this world. I
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:21.260]   See how difficult it is for human beings to just have
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:24.820]   Relationships
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:30.060]   How easily we misunderstand each other how easily we point fingers at each other?
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:34.940]   It's a miracle that human relationships last for a long period of time
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.860]   And how all of that is inside of me
[00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:42.620]   Despite all of that
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.620]   He gave himself
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:50.380]   He's in first John 4 12. No one has ever seen God if we love one another God abides in us and his love is
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.820]   perfected in us
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:55.980]   See practice of his grace and love
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:59.460]   It's not simply to burden us
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.500]   It's to free us
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.700]   It's just free us from our own sins
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:12.060]   And when Jesus says I have come to give life and to give this life abundantly this abundant life is in his love
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:15.660]   and if you're in a habit of
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:21.020]   Giving into your rage. Yeah. I mean that's that's how we are
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:25.180]   I mean if what when we're misunderstood when we feel like somebody's not on our side, you know
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:28.540]   It's our natural response to to seek justice
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:35.540]   If you're in a habit of giving into that you'll never fully comprehend
[00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:39.620]   The love that Christ has for you
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:43.340]   Just how difficult it is
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:49.460]   What he must have gone through that I can speak to him that I can come here and worship him
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:56.940]   As we again as we look upon this testimony of the power of the cross upon their lives
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:00.620]   I pray that we would not just look through this as oh, yeah, I know what Philemon is about
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:05.180]   But I pray that the power of the cross would affect you so deeply
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:08.580]   That our worship may simply be a response
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:11.580]   That we're not just singing songs
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.780]   We're praising him for his goodness
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.300]   We're not just crutchingly forgiving
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:24.340]   That we would forgive with all our hearts and that would be our act of worship because you forgave me I forgive him
[00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:29.900]   Because you've been gracious to me. I'm gonna be gracious to him not because they deserve it
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.340]   Because you gave me a love that I did not deserve
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:37.660]   so I will practice love that they don't deserve and
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:42.580]   That is why Paul is able to say so boldly
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:45.660]   to this man
[00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:48.100]   Forgive him
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.380]   Because he's been affected
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:54.860]   Would you close your eyes with me this morning as you come before the Lord?
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:02.740]   Are there people in your heart that you've been holding grudges against and as a result of that your walk with God has been strained
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:06.020]   You're living with this
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:08.420]   Toxic
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:14.180]   Hatred or bitterness in your heart and God wants you to wants you to be freed from that
[00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:17.700]   To recognize
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.980]   Just how great of a love he's shown us
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:22.900]   Behold what manner of love is?
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:25.900]   That we are called the children of God
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:31.100]   What does it mean for you to worship God this morning? What did it take for you to be here this morning?
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.420]   To have this communion with God
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:38.580]   Well, let's take a few minutes as our praise team comes up to take some time to pray and ask God Lord
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:45.060]   Help me to forgive help me to recognize that what I have in you that I may give a reasonable response
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.420]   Let's take some time to pray
