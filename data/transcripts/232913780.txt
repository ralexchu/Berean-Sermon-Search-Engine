[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.640]   Well, we're going to be doing a review today, so I know that the last session we ended with
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.560]   the review from the previous session as it ended.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.560]   So this is going to be like a re-review, rehearsing all the stuff that we know.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.840]   We want to be able to, you know, just for the sake of knowing the content of the book
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.760]   of Revelations, we definitely want to be able to kind of outline what's contained in each
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.340]   chapter.
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.840]   But some of the details of, let's say, what are the sequence of the six seals, the sequence
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.140]   of the six trumpets, I mean, we encourage you guys to study that, but I think also learning
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.840]   at least the names and the spiritual state of the seven churches in the book of Revelations
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.600]   is really important as we review this first section, this first half of the book, chapters
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.080]   1 through 11, okay?
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.000]   So please turn your Bibles there and you can kind of like glance at it as we do this.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.960]   It's going to be review in the beginning.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.620]   And as we look at it, remember in chapter 1, verse 1, it talked about how the revelation
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.920]   of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his bondservant the things which must soon
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.520]   take place, and he sent and communicated by his angel to his bondservant John, who testified
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.360]   to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all he saw.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.120]   Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy and heed the things
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.680]   which are written in it, for the time is near.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.400]   So by way of review, I want to ask the question about the purpose and setting of the book.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.480]   You guys recall that around that time there was so much persecution.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.000]   There is a question of where is Christ?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.120]   What's going to happen?
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.100]   And believe it or not, although yes, this book is in many ways, in many ways devastating
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.420]   to read, in many ways gloom, destruction, and judgment, it was for the purpose actually
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.480]   of blessing those who'd read it.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.720]   It was an encouragement to those who are suffering, okay?
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.160]   But also it was an encouragement to prepare for the coming of Christ.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160]   So let's see.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.520]   Oops, my bad.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.160]   I didn't turn it on.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.040]   Here we have the passage in Revelations chapter 16, verse 15, and the scripture says, "Behold,
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.120]   I am coming like a thief.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.120]   Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, that he may not go about
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.280]   naked and be seen exposed."
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.000]   Being ready, being prepared, that was actually the teaching of Christ through the Gospels,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.800]   and that is the message of the last book of the Bible.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.040]   The coming of Christ is truly eminent, and that we need to be prepared in every way,
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.040]   okay?
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.320]   So as we think about this, as I go through each chapter, try to remember what was contained,
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.320]   okay?
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.320]   What was contained?
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.440]   And if you recall it, go ahead and shout it out, all right?
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:14.480]   So what was contained in chapter 1 of Revelation?
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.960]   And I have the picture.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.560]   Vision of Christ, yes, you are right.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.960]   Vision of Christ amidst the seven lampstands, okay?
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.560]   Vision of Christ in the midst of the seven lampstands.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.960]   So I'll give you guys that first one.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.840]   I know it's always a little bit hard to speak up in front of a big group, but let's all
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.640]   say it together.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.720]   And then chapter 2 and 3 was?
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.240]   Excellent, the seven churches, okay, the seven churches.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.920]   So chapter 2 and 3 together, you have the message to the seven churches, okay?
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.260]   Message to the seven churches.
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.400]   Remember that they were warnings.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.440]   They were a call, there was a call to repentance.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.960]   First a commendation of what they were doing well, but then Jesus would say, "But this
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.960]   I know.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.760]   I know your deeds.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.120]   This I have against you."
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.280]   Okay, good.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.920]   What was contained in chapter 4?
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.920]   That's right, throne.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.880]   Vision of worship, okay?
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.600]   And the glory of Christ is seen in this vision.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:39.440]   And you can put actually chapter 4 and chapter 5 almost together as chapter 5 contains then?
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.880]   I think I heard, huh?
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.360]   Excellent, worship of the Lamb.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.280]   You can write Lion and the Lamb, okay?
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.960]   Worship of the Lion and the Lamb.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.600]   If you recall the story, John was in tears.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.320]   Like in the vision, he was just in tears because there was no one worthy, no one worthy to
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.000]   take the scroll, no one worthy to open the seals.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   And in chapter 5, there was a vision of the Lion and the Lamb who was worthy, okay?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.720]   And then chapter 6 is?
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.560]   Great, the seals.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.360]   As the Lamb opens and breaks the seals, you have the first sequence of the judgments that
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.360]   come through.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.000]   Chapter 6 is seals 1 through 6, okay?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.720]   Chapter 6 is seals 1 through 6.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.840]   And then chapter 7 is not the seventh seal but?
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.640]   Excellent, the great multitude and the?
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.520]   144,000, okay?
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.040]   So you can write the great multitude and the 144,000.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.640]   They were worshiping, okay?
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.800]   They were worshiping.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.320]   So you can just write 144,000, multitude and worship.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:06.240]   In the midst of the sequence of the seals, as each seal opens, there's devastating judgment.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.520]   But in almost a sequential pattern, almost like alternating, you will see that pattern
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.320]   of there's judgment and then there's a scene in heaven.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.160]   There's judgment and a scene in heaven constantly showing that God is in control and that there's
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.720]   worship of the glorious One who is sovereign, okay?
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.120]   Chapter 8.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.160]   Excellent.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:39.240]   So the seventh seal introduces the first trumpets, the first four trumpets.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.240]   There you go.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.760]   Oh, sorry, that was chapter 7.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.960]   And then chapter 8, okay?
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.360]   With the trumpets come a sequence of like worldwide catastrophic judgment, right?
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.600]   A third of this, a third of that, a third of the world, okay?
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:08.320]   And then afterwards comes the next trumpets, trumpets 5 and 6.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.440]   Trumpets 5 and 6, the description was intense.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:19.400]   It talks about the smoke, smoke of locusts with power of scorpions, inflicting pain,
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.400]   okay?
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.680]   So you can write just trumpets 5 and 6, right?
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.120]   Trumpets 5 and 6 as judgment.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:34.320]   So as chapter 8 was seventh seal to seventh trumpet, first four trumpets, chapter 9, trumpets
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.800]   5 and 6, okay?
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:43.720]   What was contained in chapter 10?
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.960]   Little scroll and the huge angel, okay?
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.760]   The strange angel who had one foot on the land, one foot on the sea.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.560]   So you can just write maybe huge angel, teeny scroll, okay?
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.560]   Easy way to remember.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.000]   Huge and tiny.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.480]   Huge angel, tiny scroll, okay?
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:09.360]   Remember the tiny scroll, John was commanded to eat of it and it was sweet in the mouth
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.960]   but it was bitter in his stomach, right?
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.560]   Sweet in the mouth and bitter in his stomach.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:21.240]   And then lastly in chapter 11, what happens in chapter 11?
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.520]   Excellent.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:32.480]   Measuring the temple and, oh wait, did I go in too far?
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.840]   I did.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.520]   And the two witnesses, okay?
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.280]   So you can write measuring the temple, two witnesses.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.280]   Measuring the temple, two witnesses, okay?
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.280]   Good.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.280]   I hope that refreshed your memory a bit going through.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.720]   Again, we're not trying to memorize an outline just for the sake of it but knowing the content
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:02.600]   and flow, again, you're going to actually see themes and patterns as you read the passage,
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.600]   okay?
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.280]   As you read through the book.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:11.640]   Now one of the things I said was that as important it is to know the content of the book, there
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.200]   are some key details I think that we should know, things that are very convicting, right?
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:22.180]   And one of the key elements is that because this is a message to the churches to be prepared,
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:28.100]   because this is a message to the churches to be encouraged, the letters to the seven
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.960]   churches is actually I think very important for people to be familiar with as they study
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.980]   the book of Revelation, okay?
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:42.840]   So in thinking about the seven churches, notice I have the three letters there.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.840]   We're going to go down and try to remember their names but for me, the way that I memorized
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:53.000]   their names was just to say ESP, TSP, you know?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.200]   ESP, TSP and then L, I don't know what to do with.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.480]   ESP, TSP and then L, right?
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.920]   So let's go through the names real fast.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.600]   E stands for?
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.600]   Ephesus.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.600]   Ephesus.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.480]   And who recalls what their, you know, rebuke was?
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:16.920]   Who recalls the problem that existed in the church of Ephesus?
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.320]   They forgot their first love.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.200]   They're the first on the list, they forgot their first love.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.120]   That's kind of the way I remembered it, okay?
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.000]   And it was a strong, that's a strong rebuke in the midst of a church that was doing well.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.160]   So just on the next of it, description-wise, you can just write church that lost its first
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.660]   love, okay?
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.740]   The second church starts with an S and that church is?
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.580]   Smyrna, okay?
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.740]   Smyrna.
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.060]   You can think of this church as the suffering church.
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:52.540]   So it begins with an S and it began the description with an S, suffering church.
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:58.900]   This is a church where Christ admonishes them, persevere even unto death.
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:05.620]   And He started to warn them, there's going to come such a testing in your day, okay?
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:13.860]   And then the church that starts with P, good, Pergamum or Pergamos, okay?
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.500]   This I didn't have anything really creative for, sorry.
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.540]   But this was a compromising church.
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:23.820]   They believe in doctrines of the Nicolaitans, okay?
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.580]   Doctrines of Nicolaitans, okay?
[00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.300]   Doctrines of Nicolaitans.
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.700]   The next church that starts with a T, that church is?
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.180]   Good, Thyatira.
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:40.140]   And that church's rebuke was?
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:47.700]   I think I just used the word Jezebel, okay?
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.980]   Jezebel.
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:53.780]   Because once you hear that word, you already know it's an adulterous church, okay?
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.380]   Adulterous church.
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:03.180]   And Christ rebukes them for tolerating that kind of immorality and adultery, okay?
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.500]   Jezebel.
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.140]   And then the next church that starts with an S is?
[00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.740]   Sardis, okay?
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.220]   Sardis.
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.500]   And that church was described as the?
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.500]   Dead church.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:23.100]   He says, "You have a name of being alive, but you are actually dead."
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.100]   Okay?
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.900]   You are actually dead.
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.780]   And then the last church, or not the last, second to last church that starts with a P
[00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:30.780]   is?
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.780]   Philadelphia, okay?
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.780]   Philadelphia.
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:42.380]   And you can just describe that church as a loving church, okay?
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:49.380]   That was the one church, Smyrna and Philadelphia were the churches where Christ gave commendation,
[00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:55.100]   commendation for who they were, okay?
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.860]   That -- okay.
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:05.420]   And then the last church, Laodicea, lukewarm, okay?
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:09.660]   Starts with an L, description starts with an L, lukewarm.
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.260]   All right.
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.260]   Whew.
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.260]   Good.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.580]   So we got there so far.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:20.660]   That kind of review sometimes, I know it's -- what's the word?
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.580]   Kind of monotonous, you know?
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:29.500]   But I recommend that, again, on your own time, try to review some of that, like, just knowing
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.940]   the content and going through what's contained.
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:38.500]   Because sometimes, actually, those are the times when you're going to have -- you're
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.800]   going to be able to read other parts of Scripture and then have immediate references because
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.020]   you're familiar with the content of the book.
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.420]   Especially I would say, again, if you want to review chapters two and three and go through
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:56.340]   the churches and listen, listen to the tone, listen to the admonition to those churches,
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.620]   listen to what Christ is challenging them with, you know?
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:04.620]   And those are all things, actually, again, that are absolutely relevant to our day and
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.620]   our time, okay?
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.060]   All right.
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:14.140]   Now, having done that, okay, having done the review in terms of just going over the content
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:19.240]   of the text, let's talk about some major themes, okay?
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:24.060]   And today we're going to do a review by way of talking about some major thematics of the
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:29.660]   book of Revelation, especially in chapters one through 11, okay?
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:35.660]   Point one, the very first thing -- let's see, I think I have a slide.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:36.660]   Oh, whoops.
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.540]   I totally forgot about those slides.
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.140]   There we go.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:47.020]   The first thematic that we want to focus on and bring our attention to is a theme of the
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.780]   revelation of Jesus.
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:53.460]   Here is this intense, intense drawing that someone drew of Christ, where His eyes are
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.460]   a blaze of fire.
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.820]   He's coming in riding on a horse.
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:01.060]   It's like, "Behold, I am Alpha and Omega," right?
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:07.380]   Well, as you think about the book entirely, actually, the whole book can be outlined thematically
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.220]   according to Christ.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.740]   For example, let me give you an outline with Christ's theme.
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:20.340]   In chapter one, there is clearly a depiction of a vision of Christ.
[00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:25.740]   And I actually challenge you, and we're going to do a little bit later, to periodically
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:32.140]   read that, because whatever we get thrown in terms of a picture, a visualization of
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:38.260]   Christ, I'm pretty sure it's not this, right?
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:42.780]   Like if you were to just answer the question of, "Okay, word association, Jesus," and then
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.600]   the first image that pops up in your head, it's not this.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.220]   It's typically like a very soft, long-haired, beautiful man with like perfect beard.
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.220]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.640]   Like that's what you would think.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.400]   So chapter one, vision of Christ.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:00.000]   Chapter two to four, Christ's authority over the church.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.960]   I mean, the description that you see in chapters two, three, and four, He's enthroned.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:13.840]   He's standing in the middle amongst the lampstands, and He's commanding the church, saying, "Repent.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.580]   I know your deeds.
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:16.580]   Do this.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.160]   Do what you already know," right?
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.160]   And He speaks as one who has vast, vast authority.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:29.940]   Next, chapter five through 19, all of it, okay, the huge chunk of it, you could actually
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:35.200]   summarize by saying it's Christ's authority to judge the world.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.720]   Christ's authority to judge the world.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.960]   I mean, think about every worship scene, and then think about what John is saying.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:46.900]   Like, "Oh, who," like Christ is crying, "Who is worthy?" and then everyone's worshiping,
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.200]   and they're crying out, "The Lamb is worthy.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.880]   Glory to the Lamb."
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:57.120]   It's a depiction of how much authority He has over the entire created universe.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:02.560]   And then finally, chapter 20 to 22, Christ's future reign, okay?
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.720]   Christ's future reign.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.760]   So as we think about the thematics of the book, I mean, we cannot escape the fact that
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.220]   this is truly a revelation of Christ's glory.
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:18.280]   The whole book is chock full of His power, His wisdom, His reign, His justice, you know,
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.240]   like everything pertaining to the majesty of Jesus Christ.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:28.280]   I actually have in your handout a little ongoing list, right?
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:33.360]   If you look at your handout, there's this long list of various depictions and descriptions
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.560]   of Jesus.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:41.060]   And we're not going to go through every single one, but just like, you know, just kind of
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:47.920]   scanning down to some of those, it's quite profound how vastly in so many angles and
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:53.300]   attributes of Christ, the book of Revelation reveals to us about who He is, right?
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:58.580]   So going down again, the faithful witness, the firstborn, the ruler over kings of the
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:03.820]   earth, the Son of Man, the first and the last, the living one, right?
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:08.060]   And we can just go on and on, and the rest of the book will have more depictions of Jesus
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.140]   Christ.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:15.300]   So there's a sense to which I am so glad that we were studying the book of Revelation, because
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:21.380]   if we really want to know Jesus as He is, then we should be studying the book of Revelation,
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.380]   right?
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:29.900]   If we really want to see and like perceive of Him as He actually is in reality, especially
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:35.660]   now, then we better be studying the book of Revelation, okay?
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:41.060]   So here's an interesting question that I want to ask you, okay?
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:46.820]   How do you think you will react when you finally see Jesus face to face?
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.860]   So take a moment to think about that, okay?
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.140]   You could even close your eyes if you want to, okay?
[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.660]   And you start to picture it and fantasize.
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:02.700]   You know, I definitely feel like the end is coming close, right?
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:10.060]   And Jesus appears in the sky, coming down with His host.
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.780]   How would you react?
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.260]   Would you have the like, "Yes!"
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.500]   You know, He says, "Run to Him!
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.500]   I love you!"
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.860]   You know?
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:24.820]   Or would you just be like stunned and awe and shock, and you just like, "Gasp!"
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.100]   You know?
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.460]   Or would you be running scared, I don't know, bowing on the floor?
[00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:36.100]   Like how would you picture yourself reacting and responding to your first actual physical
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.100]   vision of Christ?
[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:43.220]   Where we're no longer seeing in faith, but we're seeing Him with our eyes.
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.020]   Take a moment to envision that.
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:51.480]   Well, as you envision that, I want to read some passages about Christ.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:57.100]   So just flip along with, together, and this will be our form of review by reading several
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.220]   passages together, okay?
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.820]   Or yeah.
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.260]   So starting from chapter 1, verse 5.
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.660]   Okay, chapter 1, verse 5.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:12.740]   Okay, got my paper here.
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:19.360]   In chapter 1, verse 5, it says, "And from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.660]   of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth, to Him who loves us and released
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.460]   us from our sin by His blood."
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:33.340]   And in chapter 1, verse 8, it says, "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God,
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:37.620]   "who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty."
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:38.620]   Okay?
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:44.160]   So already, there are revelation of certain titles, certain elements of who He is.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.900]   And then starting from verse 12 is where we see the vision of Christ.
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.140]   So let's turn our eyes there, and I'll restart reading for us.
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:56.360]   It says, "Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.180]   And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands.
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:05.340]   And in the middle of the lampstands, I saw one like the Son of Man, clothed in a robe,
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:10.020]   reaching to the feet and girded across His chest with a golden sash.
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:17.360]   His head and His hair were white like wool, like snow, and His eye was a flame of fire.
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.660]   His feet were like burnished bronze when it had been made to glow in a furnace.
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.480]   And His voice was like the sound of many waters.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.840]   In His right hand, He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.160]   And His face was like the sun shining in its strength.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:40.520]   When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a dead man."
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.240]   Let's take a moment to just pause right there, okay?
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:52.260]   So clearly, clearly, Christ is one who would embrace those who love Him.
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:58.420]   Christ is one who would pour out and lavish with His unending love, yes?
[00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:04.980]   Christ is one who would sacrifice Himself so He's seen as the slain Lamb, humble and
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:07.260]   meek, yes?
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.440]   Okay.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:15.600]   But when John turns around and he like, you know, captures a glimpse, this vision of
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:23.400]   Christ, his immediate reaction, his immediate reaction is he is so in terror, he falls to
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:28.240]   the ground and he describes himself as a dead man.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:33.200]   But I want you to think about for that moment, just for a moment, like in context, who is
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.440]   it that is writing this?
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.160]   It's John.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.560]   Do you recall that John was called the beloved disciple?
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:46.300]   Do you recall that when John walked with Jesus, John would recline and he would like lean
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.300]   on Him?
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:51.680]   He would be so close and intimate, he would actually like as they're reclining at the
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.480]   table, he would be like in arms with Him?
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.680]   This was the beloved disciple.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:08.240]   And yet his reaction to seeing Christ, man, I mean he was completely, completely shocked,
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.640]   right?
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.080]   So here's the interesting question.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:17.920]   I mean, this is how profound and deep Christ is because the book of Revelation paints this
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.760]   picture like you see Him as the Lion and the Lamb.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:28.760]   So what's very interesting about this is the question being is, well, do we have a then
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:33.120]   balanced view of Jesus now?
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:42.880]   Is our view of Christ primarily and first and foremost loving, comforting, embracing?
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:47.880]   Or does our vision of Christ actually involve this as well?
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:53.680]   And here's an interesting question too is, do you typically, do you typically have this
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.920]   vision of Christ only for the future?
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:02.120]   You do realize John experienced this vision in the past, so is this vision of Jesus accurate
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:07.520]   in the past, present now, or the future?
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.280]   You see what I'm asking?
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:17.000]   Like this was written 2,000 years ago and Christ is the same.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.280]   Today, today, and tomorrow.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:25.560]   There is an element to which like even Christ in His earthly form, do you realize that even
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:30.800]   demons when they first caught a glimpse of Christ walking the earth, do you know what
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.360]   demons would do?
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.640]   They would shudder.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.320]   Demons would beg for mercy.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.880]   Demons would ask Him, "Don't do this now, don't do this now."
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:49.040]   So again, it really radically transformed if we have again been maybe given, given a
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:57.360]   picture of Christ that is entirely lopsided, where it's like altogether plush, you know?
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:03.720]   We really have to answer the question, is this picture that John experiences, is this
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.680]   long, long time ago only?
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.520]   Is this long, long in the future only?
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:13.080]   Or is this actually an accurate picture of Christ now?
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:17.280]   And that should radically kind of affect us in terms of the way we think and behave towards
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.280]   Christ.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.360]   Well, let's continue on.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.080]   I pause like right in the middle of it.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.480]   It says, "And He placed His right hand on me saying, 'Do not be afraid.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.520]   I am the first and the last and the living one.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.880]   And I was dead and behold, I am alive forever.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.400]   And I have the keys of death and of Hades.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.120]   Therefore, write the things which you have seen and the things which are and the things
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.760]   which will take place after these things.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.480]   As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand and the seven golden
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:52.060]   lampstands, the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven lamps
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:55.560]   are the seven lampstands are the seven churches.'"
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.760]   Okay?
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:05.440]   So I love the fact that Christ again is seen as so entirely powerful and yet He reaches
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.880]   out His hand and says, "Do not be afraid."
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.880]   Okay?
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.440]   Let's turn also to chapter 4 verse 8.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.400]   Chapter 4 verse 8.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.840]   Let's read the passage here.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.360]   Please follow along as I read.
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.760]   Chapter 4 verse 8, it says, "And the four living creatures, each one of them having
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:26.360]   six wings, are full of eyes around and within.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:32.120]   And day and night they do not cease to say, 'Holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty,
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.160]   who was and is and who is to come.'
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.920]   And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne,
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.800]   to Him who lives forever and ever, the twenty-four elders will fall down before Him who sits
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.820]   on the throne and will worship Him who lives forever and ever, and will cast down their
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:54.400]   crowns before the throne saying, 'Worthy are you, our Lord and our God, to receive glory,
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.720]   honor, and power.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:01.080]   For you created all things and because of your will they existed and were created.'
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:06.080]   Saying with a loud voice, 'Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:10.360]   and wisdom, might and honor and glory and blessing.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.800]   And every created thing which is in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:19.120]   sea and all things in them, I heard saying, 'To Him who sits on the throne and to the
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:23.680]   Lamb be blessing, honor, and glory and dominion forever and ever.'
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.720]   And the four living creatures kept saying, 'Amen.'
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.600]   And the elders fell down and worshipped."
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:33.320]   Okay?
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:39.080]   In review of, you know, in review of the chapters that we've been studying, I find this to be
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.640]   truly so convicting.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.480]   There is a sense to which, you know, Pastor Peter, I recall when he was preaching through
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:54.400]   this passage, I remember him saying, "If the glory of Christ in this fashion is not attractive
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:58.680]   to you, Christianity has very little to offer you."
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.120]   You guys remember that?
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:08.120]   When he was saying, "If this worship of God is not enticing, is not satisfying your desire,
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:14.760]   is not an ambition for you, Christianity as a whole would really be a mood point for you."
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.880]   Right?
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:22.240]   Because truly in terms of the worth, the value of all that we're doing, where is it contained?
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.840]   It's contained in the glory of Christ.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:30.280]   And so that whole worship scene where all things just as it is given to God the Father
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:38.680]   in both glory, honor, and worship is given to the Lamb who was slain, to us, to us.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:43.520]   I pray and hope that would be the most satisfying thing.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.160]   Amen?
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.600]   When we think about our Christian endeavor, when we think about our Christian involvement,
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:54.840]   when we think about what am I doing as a Christian in this life, the most satisfying thing would
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.640]   be to experience and see the glory of Christ.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:04.880]   The most satisfying thing would be then also be used by God to honor Him more, to give
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:09.440]   more thanks to Him, to give more glory to our Savior.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:18.200]   So by way of application, I want to ask again, how do you picture Jesus specifically today?
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.200]   Right?
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.440]   Specifically today?
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:28.060]   Are we thinking about Jesus Christ in one lopsided facet or are we thinking about Him
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.060]   holistically?
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:35.520]   What's more, are we thinking about Him with the kind of majesty, splendor, and reverential
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.080]   fashion that is dictated by who He is in Revelation?
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.040]   Here's another way of asking that question.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.340]   Just by way of like, again, taking a quick moment to do a self-evaluation.
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:51.280]   What would your best friends who know you, what would your parents, what would your brother,
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:55.440]   what would your sister, whoever lives with you and sees you all the time, what would
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.200]   they deduce about your view of Christ?
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.640]   Right?
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:04.040]   What would people deduce about your view of Christ?
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:10.160]   By how you speak to Him, how you treat Him, how you respond to His commandments?
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:14.880]   See, for me, it has been my own personal conviction.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:20.040]   Like, going through the book of Revelations, like I was really, really just wowed as I
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.040]   did some self-examination.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:28.960]   I really felt like I only pictured Christ in this fashion way in the distant future.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.720]   Like, only in that time when He comes, He's going to be like, "Bada!"
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.720]   You know?
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:40.480]   And then show Himself to be that powerful, show Himself to be that glorious.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:46.200]   But it didn't, like, it just blew my mind and it didn't strike me that that's His picture
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.300]   now.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:54.400]   If there is a more accurate way to view Him, He is not dressed with the waiter's, you know,
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.960]   the apron and all that kind of stuff now.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:03.640]   Rather, He is this glorious Christ receiving worship, and that's the way we ought to picture
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.200]   Him now.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.280]   Okay?
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:10.440]   So later on in your discussion time, please, I know some of these questions can be kind
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.880]   of like, I don't know, it's a big question, like, "How do you view Jesus?"
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:18.600]   I mean, that's a huge question, but take a moment to examine your heart and share what
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:24.000]   your personal thoughts about that question are in your discussion groups, okay?
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.200]   Alright.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:31.120]   So then, the next major theme, obviously, okay, obviously is judgment.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:36.320]   The vast, you know, chunk of real estate in the book of Revelation is about judgment.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.320]   And I found this picture of a man who is really, really scared, okay?
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.320]   Really, really scared.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:48.000]   Because again, the whole book can be summarized and outlined by way of the thematics of judgment,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   okay?
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.320]   Let me go through this outline with you.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.360]   Chapters 1 through 3, you can think of as warnings of the judgment to come, right?
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.600]   Warnings of the judgment.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:05.960]   And what's appropriate for us now is actually that.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:10.240]   You know, I want to challenge you, just take a moment, quick application, okay?
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:15.000]   Going from just that to application, really quick.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.520]   I have been challenged about the methodology I use to evangelize.
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.960]   Because there has been methodologies, and I have been taught many strategies of how
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:30.080]   to get to the truth of the gospel when I share the gospel with an unbeliever.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:35.360]   I had yellow packets called the four spiritual laws, the four keys, I used Romans Road, I
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.920]   used lots of different things, and that's good.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.460]   That's very good, okay?
[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:47.480]   But thinking about what's really relevant, think about what actually makes a lot of sense,
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.200]   is actually warning people.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:56.160]   Warning people of the consequences that our faith in Christ or our rejection of that faith
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.920]   has dire consequences, right?
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:04.880]   We absolutely live in a generation where all these like young people expect to try this,
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:10.000]   test that, go about their own way, you know, learn by trial by error, but experience no
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.680]   consequences.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:19.200]   But it is actually good, realistic, and appropriate to warn individuals.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:27.000]   What you do with your life now, what you choose to believe has immediate and eternal and weighty
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.280]   consequences, right?
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:34.040]   So I think about that even in terms of the way I share the gospel.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:39.000]   Do I ever share the gospel where I challenge individuals like, you know, the way Christ
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:45.800]   would even as He appeared on scene, repent for the kingdom of God is at hand.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.120]   I mean, think about what that means.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:55.040]   Would He do it the same way when I preached on Sunday in John chapter 11, where He has
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.480]   an opportunity to teach all these individuals, thousands of individuals, and the first thing
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.400]   He wants to say is, "You need to be ready.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.400]   You need to be ready.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.520]   Do you have oil?
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.520]   Are you dressed?"
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:10.160]   And I think that's something that, again, we can be challenged with in the way that
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.800]   we communicate truth as well.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:18.260]   Next part of the outline, chapter 4 through 5, okay?
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:25.680]   In chapter 4 through 5, there is, again, the release of the judgment, the vision of – let
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:26.680]   me see what I wrote.
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:27.680]   Okay, here.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:28.680]   It's a little bit long.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:34.480]   The vision of Jesus who has authority to open the seal or open the judgment, right?
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:41.400]   Because He has the right to the deed, meaning He has the right to the earth.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.520]   He has a right to judge it as well.
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.280]   And then going down, these are all review, okay?
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.480]   And this is by way of review for you.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.560]   Chapter 6 is the first sequence of the seal – oh, sorry.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.040]   Yeah, chapter 6 is a seal judgment.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:35:00.160]   Chapter 7 is those individuals who are saved out of judgment.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:04.920]   So if you actually read chapter 7 carefully, it'll say the great multitudes, but it'll
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:08.760]   say the great multitudes out of the tribulation, okay?
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.280]   Out of the tribulation.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.680]   So it's still in relationship to the judgment.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:19.960]   Chapter 8 through 9, the transition from seal judgments to the trumpet judgments, okay?
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:24.040]   Transition from the seal judgments to the trumpet judgments.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:29.280]   Here's another way also of seeing chapter 10 and 11.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:34.760]   Chapter 10 and 11 actually is the 3.5 years of the tribulation judgment, okay?
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:39.440]   The passage calls it the great tribulation judgment.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:44.880]   And I want to take that opportunity of talking about the great tribulation judgment to highlight
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.360]   something about the judgment, okay?
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:52.600]   I think it's one thing for us to know like, "Yes, I believe in hell."
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.600]   It's another thing for us to be like, "Yes, I believe there's going to come a time when
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:01.640]   Christ will come and He's going to give – He's going to make people give an account for their
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.280]   lives," right?
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:11.600]   But it's another thing to actually picture it, to have an – almost a preview experience
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:12.600]   with it.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.280]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:18.440]   It's one thing to know certain things like when you – for many of you who are in the
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:22.840]   medical field, you learn through the biology books of like, "Okay, this is how you do
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.080]   a dissection.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.680]   This is what the liver looks like.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.160]   This is what the blood looks like," and yada, yada, yada.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:33.720]   It's another thing to actually go to an operation and see blood, right?
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.440]   There was a small, small moment in my life when I thought that maybe I could go down
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.440]   that medical route.
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:42.400]   And then I saw blood and I was like, "Blech," and I said, "No," right?
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:48.840]   The experience taught me very vividly the memory, the reaction that I have is entirely
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.440]   different when there is a vision of it, right?
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.440]   There's a vision of it.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:37:00.960]   So that being said, we should give careful attention to the fact that in the telling,
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:07.200]   in the revelation of the visions of judgment to come, it's actually very descriptive.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.760]   And that's supposed to create an effect in us, right?
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.320]   That's supposed to move us.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.320]   It's supposed to.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:16.880]   If you feel emotional about the book of Revelations, good, right?
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.960]   Very good.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.680]   If you feel a sense of fear, if you feel a sense of being like shaken by the book of
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.160]   Revelations, good.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.400]   That's the way it should be.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:32.080]   So in reviewing the thematics of judgment in the book of Revelations, let's talk about
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:35.640]   the intensity and severity of the judgment.
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:39.240]   Let's go over to chapter 6, verses 12 through 17.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:45.480]   Chapter 6, verses 12 through 17.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:49.120]   Okay.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:52.840]   So again, I'll take a moment to read for us.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:58.800]   Chapter 6, verse 12 through 17 says this, "I looked and when he broke the sixth seal,
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.960]   there was a great earthquake.
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:07.000]   The sun became black as sackcloth made of hair and the whole moon became like blood.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.400]   And the stars of the sky fell to the earth as a fig tree cast its unripe figs when shaken
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.880]   by a great wind.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:18.520]   The sky was split apart like a scroll when it is rolled up and every mountain and island
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.640]   were moved out of their places.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.640]   When the kings of the earth, the great men and the commanders of the rich and the strong,
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:29.560]   and every slave and free man hid himself in the caves among the rocks of the mountains.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:34.400]   They said to the mountains and to the rocks, 'Fall on us and hide us from the presence
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:39.360]   of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:46.480]   For the great day of the wrath has come and who is able to stand?'"
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.640]   That's crazy to me, right?
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.280]   I wasn't able to see the solar eclipse.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:39:00.000]   People made a huge deal about it, but I was able to watch some of the subsequent newsreels.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.040]   I went and watched YouTube of like certain scientists who watched and it was hilarious.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.200]   They're like, "Oh, it's happening."
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.880]   And then all of a sudden this grown man's like, "Oh my gosh, I'm crying."
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:17.440]   And then they show like the land surrounding them, the people especially along that, you
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.720]   know, the line or whatever.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:22.080]   The land surrounding them just goes dark and then everyone's like, "Oh!"
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.040]   And you just hear people, you know.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:31.200]   Just over a brief four or five minute experience of seeing an eclipse.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:36.440]   But we're talking about the sky splitting apart and rolling like a scroll, mountains
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:40.160]   and islands moved out of their place.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.200]   And it's so scary that it doesn't even matter.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:46.760]   It's saying it doesn't matter who you are, whether you felt like you were the bomb, whether
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:52.360]   you felt like you were, you know, powerful, rich and mighty, free or slave, you were in
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:57.040]   the cave hiding because you were so scared.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.040]   Imagine that.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.200]   Imagine that, you know.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.160]   Again it's so descriptive of the judgment to come.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.080]   We should never just like glance over it.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:10.440]   It's like, "Okay, there were the seals and then there were the trumpets," you know.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:17.680]   So on top of the intensity and the severity of the judgment, there is also the extent,
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.820]   the extent of the judgment.
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:25.600]   So turn your Bibles to chapter 9, verse 13 through 21.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.640]   Okay.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:33.560]   Chapter 9, verse 13 through 21.
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:40.080]   So here the passage says, "Then the sixth angel sounded.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:45.120]   I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:49.200]   One saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, 'Release the four angels who are
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.840]   bound at the great river Euphrates.'
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:57.760]   And the four angels who had been prepared for the hour and day by month and year were
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.480]   released so that they would kill a third of mankind.
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:05.920]   The number of the armies of the horsemen was 200 million.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:10.320]   I heard the number of them and this is how I saw the vision of the horses who sat on
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.320]   them.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:17.600]   The riders had breastplates the color of fire and," I don't know how to pronounce that,
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:21.760]   "siasynth and brimstone," sorry, "and the heads of the horses are like the heads of
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:25.720]   lions and out of the mouths proceed fire, smoke, and brimstone.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:31.040]   A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues, by fire and smoke and brimstone,
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.880]   which proceeded out of their mouths.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.000]   For the power of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.320]   For their tails are like serpents and have heads and with them they do harm."
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:46.240]   I just, you know, it's so unfathomable.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:53.520]   Perhaps the greatest, you know, collection of people that we've seen in one place is
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:55.800]   maybe like a million people.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.280]   I don't know.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:02.560]   But just to imagine just the armies of the horsemen were 200 million and a third of the
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.680]   entire population.
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:10.080]   Earth's population, you know, is like 6.8 or something like that, billion or something,
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.080]   getting close to 7 billion.
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:20.600]   But I just want you to imagine the extent, the extent of horror, the extent of judgment.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.960]   It's truly unimaginable, right?
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.920]   Truly unimaginable.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:33.000]   So as we take a moment to think about that, we can now kind of quickly turn to questions
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   of application.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:44.920]   You know, first assessing again our perception of the judgment to come.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:52.560]   If perhaps, if perhaps, we too have minimized consequences, so to speak.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:43:00.680]   If we minimize, if we minimize the power of God in terms of His wrath, we should be weary.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.000]   We should be weary.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   Why?
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.400]   Because Scripture makes it such a big deal for us to understand that for us who believe
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:14.240]   the first realistic vision we should have of God is one of fear.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:18.240]   That we ought to learn what it means to fear God and His power.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.640]   When you look at all the Old Testament passages of the admonition for the people of God to
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:27.600]   learn how to fear God, it talks about God's creative power.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.320]   It also talks about God's destructive power, right?
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:34.280]   And so as we think about that, here's an interesting thing.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:39.760]   We can immediately dismiss the kind of judgment that we see by saying, "Well, thank God we're
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.200]   safe," right?
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.040]   We could immediately dismiss all that we're reading in terms of the book of Revelation
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.920]   and say, "Well, thank God I'm on the right side."
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:55.680]   But the fact of the matter is, yes, we are not going to experience the wrath of God because
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:01.480]   Christ, Christ has already dealt with the wrath of God for us.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:07.400]   But everything we know of this world, everything we know of the world that we know is going
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:14.200]   to experience a kind of intense, severe, and great extensive punishment.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:17.960]   And that's something in of itself to be fearful of.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:24.960]   What's more, understanding and knowing that should cause a level of sobriety.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.240]   It should cause a level of all kinds of different amifications, which I'm going to ask you guys
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:32.120]   to discuss in your discussion groups.
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:37.040]   So here is a question I have for you, okay?
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:42.580]   Yes, for those of us who have the assurance of Christ's sacrifice on our behalf, for those
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:48.380]   of us who have entrusted our lives into His gracious saving hands, does the knowledge
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:53.600]   of the judgment that is to come still play a role in our sanctification?
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.880]   You know what I'm asking?
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:01.880]   Does an understanding of this pervasive, intense judgment that is to come still have a role
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:05.720]   in our sanctification as believers, right?
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:11.080]   Does it only stand as a dire warning for everyone who is unbelieving, or does it actually still
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:14.560]   stand as a means of sanctifying us as believers?
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:15.560]   And if so, why?
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:16.560]   How?
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.040]   That's the question, okay?
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:22.420]   So those are some of the questions that I would like you guys to discuss in your discussion
[00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:28.680]   groups, but the last thing I want to challenge you with is with this, is the book of Revelation
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:34.320]   definitely is not like your typical New Testament letter, where it tells you you ought to be
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:38.600]   loving, you ought to sacrifice, you have to watch your words, you have to be diligent,
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:43.640]   and you have to be persevering, and all of these didactic teachings, right?
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:47.000]   And what's more, I'm pretty sure that many of you have felt going through the book of
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.640]   Revelation is a sense of repetition, yes?
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:57.080]   It's like, okay, we've read about the judgment, and we read about this fiery testing, and
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:02.440]   we read about this purging that's going to happen, and it's going to repeat.
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:05.320]   But what is that supposed to do to our hearts?
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:11.920]   Well, I want to reiterate, in all things, when we are approaching Scripture with this
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:17.680]   kind of theology and teaching of what's to come, we're supposed to grow in our understanding
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:22.600]   of how to fear God, right?
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:28.280]   You're supposed to grow in your understanding of how to fear God, because your fear of God
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:34.360]   is going to affect every single aspect of how you approach God and the things of God.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:39.280]   I talked about it on Sunday a bit, but I feel like this is such a huge, huge topic that
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:43.080]   we need to keep wrestling with for the rest of our lives.
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:47.260]   What does it mean to truly fear God as a Christian?
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:53.060]   And the fear of God is going to affect everything from, yes, our attitude of respect.
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:59.240]   If we, let's say, have attitudes of maybe lack of appreciation, you know, where we're
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:04.200]   not as thankful as we ought to be, there's almost a question of do we really understand
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.680]   how to fear the Lord?
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:11.440]   Because an individual who genuinely knows how to fear God, who understands, yes, there
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:18.560]   is this devastating, terrifying, powerful, so incredibly powerful individual, yet he
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.840]   has touched my shoulder and said, "Do not fear.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:21.840]   You will be thankful."
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:28.240]   And when it comes to your attitudes of flippancy, well, the fear of God is going to teach you
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.080]   to be cautious.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:35.040]   The fear of God is going to teach you to carefully do and to carefully obey.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:38.880]   Whether it be even your lack of love and concern for others, your fear of God is going to teach
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:44.360]   you to do that as you wonder how people would fare against such a terrifying God.
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:49.640]   Attitudes of urgency, attitudes of discernment, attitudes of how to make a decision that matters,
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:54.600]   all of this is contingent upon your fear of God.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:48:02.480]   So by way of, again, concluding, I think if anything, if you're striving for any kind
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:07.360]   of like result and fruitfulness from the study of Revelations, really want to challenge as
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:11.200]   we kind of review chapters 1 through 11 and the beginning portions of the sequence of
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:17.680]   judgments that we have to be asking the question, "Am I learning and experiencing and seeing
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:20.920]   a greater aspect of the fear of my God who is so powerful?"
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:21.920]   Amen?
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:22.920]   Okay.
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:26.440]   Well, let's take a moment to pray, and then we'll dismiss you guys to your small groups
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.960]   to have discussion.
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:42.720]   Heavenly Father, we want to begin by saying thank you that God, you have warned us.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.560]   You have warned us, Father, of what your plans are.
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:49.520]   You have warned us, Father, of who you are.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:56.720]   And I ask God that just as the Scriptures and your Word advises us to do, I pray, Lord,
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:01.960]   that we would heed your Word and, God, that we would be desiring to be ready.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:07.960]   Lord, I pray that you would give us discernment of wisdom so that first we'd be ready by preparing
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:08.960]   our hearts.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:15.120]   Lord, that we would be all the more challenged to examine our faith, to see if we really
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:21.800]   are in belief and trust of Christ, but what's more, eagerly anticipating your coming, Lord.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:26.960]   I also pray, Father God, that all the things that we are learning would continue to make
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:32.920]   its impact in both the way that we think and view the world, but what's more, impact the
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:35.680]   way that we feel and relate to you.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:40.960]   I ask, Lord, that your Word would continue just to guide every aspect of who we are.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.960]   We pray for a fruitful time of discussing with each other.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:50.000]   I pray, Father God, that you would help us to examine our own hearts, be willing to share
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.160]   where we are in our faith, Lord.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.560]   We thank you, it's in Christ, and we pray, amen.
