[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.320]   Hi, my name is Yoon, and this is my testimony.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.360]   Like many others, I grew up in the church and continued to attend until I was about
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.000]   ten years old.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.760]   During that time, my parents had converted to Catholicism, and both of my sisters went
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.960]   and founded a different church.
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.520]   I continued to attend various churches, but eventually my ten-year-old mind concluded
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.640]   that there was nothing for me there.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.040]   I had learned that Jesus loved me, died for my sins, and that I am saved to go to heaven.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.480]   So why did I have to continue to attend church?
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.460]   It was difficult for me to understand the purpose of attending, and no one at the church
[00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.980]   has really explained to me this purpose.
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.600]   So I stopped attending.
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.480]   And of course, my determination to continue my faith at home by praying and reading the
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.060]   Bible was very short-lived.
[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.560]   I spent all my free time on what most other kids did during that age, which was to play
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.640]   and hang out with friends.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.460]   I was diligent in my schoolwork and slowly built up my pride upon the worldly knowledge
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.000]   that I have gained throughout the years.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.680]   There was nothing wrong with my life, and I should have been perfectly content.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.900]   But for some reason, I felt empty.
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.840]   I think puberty hit me a little earlier than most because I was already starting to have
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.360]   an existential crisis, questioning for what purpose I was working so hard for in school
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.640]   and to please other people.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.560]   And I believe it was the grace of God that gave me that empty feeling because I started
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.980]   to think about and search for the purpose of my life.
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.720]   God started to guide me closer to Christ with the people around me who would ask me to come
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.200]   out to church with them.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.440]   I said no in the politest way possible numerous times, but they were very persistent.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.480]   What really made me go back to church and turn to Christ was my older sister.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.480]   Ever since she delved deeper into her faith, she would go on a lot of missionary trips,
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.080]   do service at her home church, and pray at home for our family, which I could hear across
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.340]   the thin wall between our rooms.
[00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.360]   It wasn't those things specifically that made me realize that her faith in Christ has changed
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.360]   her, but it made me recognize the changes in her speech and actions.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.600]   She was a completely different person, and she would agree with me when I say that she
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.360]   was not a very nice person before, at least to me.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.520]   The changes in her were surprising, but she seemed so happy, so content, and so hopeful,
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.640]   which was what I was looking for.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.840]   I instinctively knew that it was the work of Christ in her life, and I wanted him to
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.240]   give me that same hope, so I started to attend my cousin's home church at the age of 14.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.240]   I was learning about the gospel again, filling myself with head knowledge for about a year,
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.960]   and there were no specific changes in my view of life, but God gave me the heart to continue
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.840]   attending.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.800]   One day, during group prayer, God convicted me of my sins, the arrogance, pride, anger,
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.320]   lust, all the filth that I filled myself up with in this world, and that was when I finally,
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.960]   finally repented, and accepted him as my Lord and Savior.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.440]   And I was so grateful that he continued to love me when I was a sinner, and loved me
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.040]   enough to save me from my sins, that my life purpose was changed to equip myself with his
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.760]   word so that I may know and do his will.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.920]   I was passionate to learn about Christ and the Father, and gradually made time to read
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.520]   his word and pray.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.840]   And his work in my life slowly started to appear in the way I approached sin.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.640]   I was not afraid of the consequences of sin, but I was afraid to disappoint the Father
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.220]   who had extended his grace so that I may no longer live in sin.
[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.680]   And during my walk in faith, I definitely had many spiritually dry seasons where I had
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.440]   stumbled, but God continued to grip me with his faithfulness, and I now know that there's
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.400]   nothing that can separate me from his great love.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.280]   Finally, I want to conclude my testimony with an encouraging verse that continues to give
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.020]   me strength to persevere.
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.560]   It is John 16, 33.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.520]   These things I have spoken to you so that in me you may have peace.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.480]   In the world you will have tribulations, but take courage, I have overcome the world.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.240]   I often find it difficult to continue in steadfast faith, especially while living in a sin-corrupted
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.240]   world.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.960]   But I have to regularly remind myself that God works out all things for good for those
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.340]   that love him.
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.160]   He works in the most unexpected ways at the most inconceivable time, and I find myself
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.200]   badgering him for answers and solutions as I struggle with the things that this world
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.840]   throws at me.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.480]   Even this week has been so far the most stressful and anxiety-ridden week I have had in a series
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.920]   of stressful weeks.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.960]   But God spoke to me through the very source of my stress, telling me, "Trust my process,
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.720]   my plan, my timing," which was the answer to all the series of anxious and distressed
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.360]   prayers I had given.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.920]   And the simple answer was what I had already known, which was, "Trust God's timing, trust
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.440]   God's plan, trust God's process, and trust God."
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.440]   Thank you for listening.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.440]   [Applause]
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:05.440]   [Applause]
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:15.440]   [Applause]
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:35.440]   [Applause]
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:45.440]   [Applause]
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.440]   [ Applause ]
