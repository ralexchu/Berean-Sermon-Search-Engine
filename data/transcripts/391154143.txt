[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.180]   Let's take a moment to read our passage together.
[00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.720]   So please have that portion of the packet there with you.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:21.200]   And the scripture says, "For this reason, I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.340]   Jesus which exists among you and your love for all the saints, do not cease giving thanks
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.940]   for you while making mention of you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.120]   the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and a revelation in the knowledge
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.120]   of him.
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.840]   I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.240]   the hope of his calling, what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.480]   and what is the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.080]   These are in accordance with the working of the strength of his might, which he brought
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.040]   about in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.120]   heavenly places.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.800]   Far above all rule and authority and power and dominion in every name that is named,
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.400]   not only in this age but also in the one to come.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.000]   And he put all things in subjection under his feet and gave him as head over all things
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.520]   to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.520]   Okay.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.080]   It's a really beautiful passage of Apostle Paul essentially sharing his mentality about
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.960]   the church, right?
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.840]   Now as we come to this passage, we want to review that remember in the last section that
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.280]   we took several weeks to cover, we reviewed and learned the massive blessings that exist
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.000]   all in Christ.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.200]   Everything was in him and through him, right?
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:03.160]   And we saw that the incredible loving intentionality that God had towards us, right?
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.160]   There was nothing in terms of flippancy.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.520]   There was nothing in terms of last minute like, "Oops, Valentine's is Friday."
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.320]   It just didn't creep up on him like, "Oh, shoot, I forgot all these little ones I made."
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.040]   It just never happened that way.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.360]   But rather it was meticulously planned from the creation of the world, right?
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.680]   We saw that intentionality and it was crazy.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.040]   Everything was in accordance to his perfect will.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.640]   And so what we saw was an incredible list of not just simply things we receive, it was
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.480]   an incredible list of God's intentional will.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.400]   Everything was by his own decision, his purpose, and we saw that repeated so many times.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.000]   And so therefore, all of that was to result in praise to God.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.600]   All of that was supposed to result in blessed be God, the Father of our Lord.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.920]   And so the challenge to you, application wasn't like, "Go out there and build the church,"
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.880]   or whatever, although that's something you should always be doing.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.960]   It was more so worship.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.640]   Bless God.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.680]   Think him in your heart, right?
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.080]   Check your heart to see if there's any part of you that's like, "Wah, boo-hoo, look at
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.080]   my life.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   What have you done for me lately?
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.040]   Don't we dare ever."
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.360]   After covering a section like that, we dare not have that kind of hurtful heart and mentality
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.640]   inside our minds or inside our emotions when we think about the Lord.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.960]   Now when we just read this passage, moving from that long list of blessings, how are
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.280]   we to move into this passage is the question, when Apostle Paul says the various things.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.360]   So in order to do that, I just want to challenge you guys to regularly summarize what you're
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.660]   reading because it helps you kind of just remember and retain, but also to keep thinking
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.520]   and thinking and thinking about all the stuff you saw.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.920]   What I like to do is read the passage again, but to read the passage on your packet on
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.720]   the next page behind it in the kind of breakdown fashion that I like to do because that'll
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.720]   help us notice.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.720]   So I'm going to read it again.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:20.720]   He says in verse 15, "For this reason, I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.360]   Jesus which exists among you and your love for all the saints, do not cease giving thanks
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.320]   for you while making mention of you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.720]   the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation and the knowledge
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.720]   of him.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.680]   I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened so that you will know what is
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.120]   the hope of his calling, what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.240]   and what is the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.600]   These are in accordance with the working of the strength of his might, which he brought
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.640]   out about in Christ.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.600]   And he raised him from the dead and he seated him at the right hand in the heavenly places
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.800]   far above all rule, authority, and power, dominion, every name that is named, not only
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.800]   in this age but also in the one to come.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.280]   And he put all things in subjection under his feet and he gave him as head over all
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.440]   things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all."
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.840]   Okay?
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:32.360]   As you take a look at that, man, you know, we ask this question and so we're going to
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.720]   come back to this question, is how do you summarize this?
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.080]   And what I like to say is, man, you see him connecting the thought of the blessings that
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:51.080]   he has seen and praises God for, and he connects it to the people whom he sees faith in.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.360]   And therefore he prays.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.100]   What am I saying here?
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.600]   By way of kind of connecting the dots for us a little bit, again, I think Apostle Paul,
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.740]   he doesn't just jump from one thought to another.
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.360]   What he really is doing is he's seeing, yes, the long list of blessings that we went through
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.680]   in the last passage and saying, "We have to really, really appreciate all of these blessings
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.100]   we have in Christ."
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.440]   So you notice the theme of this entire section, there's so much about knowledge, understanding,
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.840]   and having your eyes wide open.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.640]   You should really understand this stuff.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.640]   Is that what he's saying?
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.920]   Well, I think there's more.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.920]   What am I saying?
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:36.360]   Here, let's jump to the first section and take a look.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:42.600]   He's got this thought for this reason, but what he's saying is, "What I've heard is your
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.160]   faith and your love that exists in you."
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.560]   What does he see?
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.040]   He sees genuine markers, evidences of true faith.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.700]   So in Paul's perspective, he's got one on one side in his mind, all of these incredible
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.600]   blessings that come in Christ that are, for lack of better words, just incredible, right?
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.560]   Just absolutely incredible.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.360]   And so on this side, though, what he sees is that there is marks of genuine faith among
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.160]   the people that he's writing to.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.360]   And that to me all makes sense.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.760]   For example, imagine if you were a teacher, let's say in high school, a high school English
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.720]   teacher or something like that, and you had a class of like 30 students.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.880]   And you find out, "Oh my goodness, that young man over there, he's a Christian."
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.880]   Would you be like, "Ah, then I don't need to pay attention to him, because he's going
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.880]   to be all right."
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.120]   No, you'd be like, "Oh my goodness, you're a Christian?"
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.480]   All of a sudden you feel what?
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.480]   Affinity?
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.520]   What's more, all of a sudden you feel more concern, because you know that he's going
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.400]   to be perhaps walking a hard path, because he's going to have to contend for his faith,
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.760]   because he is a minority in terms of just the culture of the day or whatever it may
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.760]   be.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.480]   And now all of a sudden you might even want to meet with him.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.560]   "How are you doing?
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.560]   Is it hard?
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.440]   Are you doing okay?"
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.280]   And then you'd be what?
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.640]   Inspired to pray for him.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.640]   Right?
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.760]   I kind of feel that sense.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.080]   It's like once Apostle Paul sees that there is faith in these individuals, there is even
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.000]   a greater concern.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.080]   Perhaps some of us feel like, "He's Christian, he'll be fine."
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.920]   Maybe you think some of the people around you, it's like, "They'll be okay.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.920]   We don't need to pray for them."
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.920]   Right?
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.920]   Just got to pray for the lost.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.880]   Well actually, as a matter of fact, if you think about it in the right perspective, this
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.320]   all makes sense.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.240]   That Apostle Paul would be giving great thanks because all the great blessings that he just
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.600]   talked about is yours.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.600]   Right?
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.260]   I mean, imagine with me another scenario.
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:45.180]   If I said, "Great news, I won the lotto."
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.300]   And to one single worthy person, "I would love to give a million dollars."
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.300]   Right?
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.460]   And then imagine the next week, at the next Bible study, you see, I don't know, you see
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.580]   Emily, she's just like happy and she's like, "Here, I love you."
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.580]   You know?
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.000]   She's just giving it away.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.820]   Maybe she's just a lady, she's like happy the whole time.
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.260]   Immediately you think like, "Oh my gosh, did he give it to you?"
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.260]   Why?
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.820]   Because of her generosity.
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:15.660]   Likewise, if he sees love for all the saints, if he sees faith filling an individual's heart,
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:20.140]   a church, their hearts, I mean, he's so grateful for that.
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.140]   Right?
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:26.260]   So, all I'm saying is this, is here in the beginning, we think about what Apostle Paul
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:31.300]   is really both excited about, right?
[00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.100]   You would be just ecstatic for her, happy with her.
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.060]   Think about what he's praying for.
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.540]   And then let's take a moment to just think and meditate, you know?
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:47.100]   Because in these beginning portions of the book of Ephesians, a lot of it is not didactic
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.300]   teaching and instruction about this is what you need to do.
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:56.100]   A lot of it is think, remember, understand, and know.
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.780]   Yes?
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:06.900]   In Apostle Paul's mind, the perspective and definitions of what are true blessings, then
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:13.020]   contribute to you thinking about what are then true sources of joy for you.
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:18.180]   If for him, the true blessings are all up in Christ, then that also then paints for
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:23.820]   him what are those things that he's going to be most thankful for, most happy about,
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:29.580]   most ecstatic, and therefore also most pressing on his prayer list.
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.020]   Yes?
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.660]   Take a moment to meditate for yourself.
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:38.340]   Then are these the things that you give thanks unceasingly?
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.980]   Are these the things that just make you keep worrying and make you keep thinking and motivating
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:43.980]   you?
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.220]   Like, "I got that student who's a Christian and he's growing.
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.420]   I need to pray for him."
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.060]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.420]   Is this what's kind of pressing?
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.440]   Is this what's valuable?
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:01.060]   And the evidences of faith that Apostle Paul sees in this church then to him are absolutely
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.060]   important.
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.420]   And I want to show you that too.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.700]   First Peter.
[00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:10.060]   First Peter chapter one, verse six through seven, it says, "In this you greatly rejoice,
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:15.380]   even though now for a little while it's necessary that you have been distressed by various trials."
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.060]   Lots of hardships, right?
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.460]   "So that the proof of your faith is," what?
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:26.120]   "It's being more precious than gold, which is perishable, even though tested by fire
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:32.700]   may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.820]   Take a moment to meditate upon this.
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:40.100]   I am saying to you, there was this question, why is Apostle Paul praying for a bunch of
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.860]   people he knows are already Christian?
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.460]   Yes?
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.740]   Because there is a second thought that the ongoing perseverance and the evidence of that
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.660]   faith is more valuable than gold.
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:59.100]   And so, when you look at your friends, brothers and sisters at church, and you're praying
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.780]   for them, right?
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:05.900]   You can, it's totally okay and ecstatic, and good for you to be ecstatic that your friend
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.100]   landed that job, right?
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:12.520]   Or that they got out of that horrible, miserable situation, whatever it may be.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.700]   Be happy for them.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:20.480]   But there is that question of how you are interpreting what are true blessings, right?
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.540]   There's a question you need to meditate about what are true things you're seeing as like
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:28.060]   that's so good for Apostle Paul.
[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:32.740]   It's the evidence what he sees and what he hears that these individuals have true faith.
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:37.100]   Next, section two.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:41.260]   Let's take a look at this, and I ask you the question, right, for your Bible study, what
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.340]   does Paul pray for?
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.340]   So what is the content of Paul's prayer?
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.900]   And what is the pattern that you see in his prayer?
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.660]   So let's read that as well.
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.980]   So follow along on the screen here.
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.780]   And you saw it, it's like so, like again, he's so clear in his teaching, it's like that,
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:05.140]   number one, God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.900]   of wisdom, of revelation, and the knowledge of him.
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.900]   Okay?
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:15.020]   And he says, I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened so that you will
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.020]   know.
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.900]   Let's stop there, okay?
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.340]   So clearly we can say we see a pattern.
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:27.420]   We see a pattern of the emphasis that Apostle Paul is clearly praying for and giving his
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:34.520]   devoted time and energy, asking that God would constantly give them truth, right?
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.380]   To give the church truth and true understanding.
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:43.860]   Because we know it's not enough, it's absolutely not enough to just know some things.
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.580]   It's not enough to have some fact toys in your brain.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.120]   It's not enough to have the intellectual knowledge.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.680]   You need to understand.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:57.260]   And you need to have wisdom where you can skillfully apply truth, right?
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.380]   So that's what he's asking for.
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.940]   This is very similar to what we studied long ago in Colossians chapter one, verses nine
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:04.980]   through 10.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.460]   For the sake of time, I'm gonna read it for us.
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:10.380]   It says, "For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have not ceased to
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:16.300]   pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:22.660]   wisdom and understanding so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord."
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:23.820]   Okay?
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.380]   So let's take a moment to meditate upon that too.
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:34.220]   I mean, really fast, I could just ask you to meditate upon your life specifically now.
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.520]   Are you growing in fact toys?
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.780]   Are you growing in good student-based homework assignments?
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:47.660]   And you've got binders full at home of all the assignments you did.
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:51.260]   Or are you growing in understanding?
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.420]   Depth of appreciation for the love of God, for the work of God, for the redemption that
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.780]   we have, the blessings of God?
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:04.100]   Are you growing in such a wisdom where your consideration of God, you see him in greater
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:09.720]   light, you see his everything, holiness to his mercies, to his righteousness, and not
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:15.800]   only do you appreciate that, but being then in his presence as you see him, it's absolutely
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:21.240]   affecting the way that you talk to him, it's affecting the way that you talk to others.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.280]   Are you growing in that?
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:31.260]   And so another way to apply this and meditate upon this is thinking about Apostle Paul's
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.820]   prayer and then applying that to you.
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:40.020]   I would ask, especially because our theme is like knowing God and then making him known,
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:44.420]   every single one of you is like at some point or another going to be an older brother in
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.900]   the faith, older sister in the faith.
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:54.480]   Can you take a moment to just imagine with me the person in front of you who you love
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.560]   and you want them to come along in the faith?
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.640]   And you wish that you could teach them some things?
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:04.300]   Maybe you have a younger brother in the faith who's just like stubborn as can be, and they're
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.580]   always contentious with you.
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.580]   It's like, "Whee, a butt!"
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.020]   And he's just like, "Rawr!"
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:14.500]   Or maybe you can imagine the person, maybe it's your own child, and I think about this,
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:20.020]   how do I teach my sons to be godly, mature young men?
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.460]   Have you ever thought stuff like that?
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:26.820]   How do you get someone to move from point A to point B?
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.840]   Lesson one to session 10 and actually grow from here to there.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:37.220]   If we're real, we all know that's a very difficult calling, right?
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:41.780]   For us to try to teach and model and instruct and coach.
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:46.540]   And there are times when we get all frustrated, it's like, "What are you doing?"
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.740]   And there are days when you wish, like I wish I could just reach into your heart and just
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.500]   like change it, you know?
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.380]   If I could, right?
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:59.580]   And then there are moments when I start thinking even on my own kids.
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:06.340]   I think about how do I make sure that they don't grow up to be unappreciative, just selfish,
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.460]   arrogant kids, you know?
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.900]   Arrogant young men.
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.020]   And there are days when I start imagining, "You know what I'm going to do?
[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.020]   I'm going to make them suffer."
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.020]   You know?
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.180]   They're going to know what it means to not have.
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.540]   And there are some times I sit my boys down and I'm like, "I'm going to be honest, you're
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.380]   so blessed, it's ridiculous.
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.520]   You have two parents who love you to death.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.300]   You have this amazing church where your friends are awesome.
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:32.020]   You've got other uncles and aunties and you've got brothers and sisters above you.
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.580]   And you're so blessed."
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.500]   And then I start sometimes comparing with them and then I get this inspiration, "I'm
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.620]   going to make them suffer."
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:47.380]   So that they will know what it means to appreciate the stuff they have, right?
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.380]   And then I think, "What am I doing?
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.420]   What am I doing?"
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.940]   And then I want to share with you something really interesting.
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:58.340]   There was a time when like, you guys have probably done this before.
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:02.100]   If you've suffered in your life, you kind of have a little like, "That's right.
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.660]   You have a silver spoon right up in your mouth, man.
[00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:05.660]   But me, I suffered."
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.940]   And so you have this little bit of arrogance in you, right?
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.900]   But we went to a conference where Dr. Steve Lawson was preaching.
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.900]   And this man is like godly.
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.900]   You know, he's a godly man.
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:22.500]   This individual is just like, his passion to preach the gospel, see people saved, and
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.060]   he's trained the Christians.
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.540]   It's like so intense.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:31.580]   This conference was a conference where he preached eight sessions by himself, did Q&A
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.460]   in between, and walked with people through questions the whole time.
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.820]   I'm like, "Dude, you're crazy, right?"
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.140]   You know what's really interesting?
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:43.380]   The guy grew up as goody two-shoe as you could possibly think of.
[00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.700]   He was wearing a suit since he was like six years old, okay?
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:52.600]   His father made him like iron his pants and put on his blazer and wear a tie every Sunday
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.240]   since he was a child.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.880]   His father taught him everything there is to know, and he was talking about how he's
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.880]   thankful for that.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.380]   And I was kind of sitting there like, "Hmm.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.380]   This guy's so passionate.
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.820]   Like, I thought he'd gone to jail or something before."
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:06.820]   You know?
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.340]   Isn't that a prerequisite to be all passionate and stuff?
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:13.500]   Brothers and sisters, why do I talk about that?
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.780]   Like, why do I talk about the difficulty of training kids and then this other extreme
[00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:23.640]   where you have some of the godliest men who've had an incredibly privileged life?
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:30.380]   Because no human experience is going to teach what the Holy Spirit is going to teach.
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.100]   The Word of God is absolutely sufficient for us.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.540]   Yes?
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:40.140]   And what that means is, yes, I might want to soul control and manipulate my children's
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.140]   life.
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.740]   "You're not going to do this, and you're not going to see that, and you're not going to
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.740]   do this."
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:48.540]   And I might be tempted sometimes to scream in his face, like, "Just do it!"
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.540]   Right?
[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:56.220]   But even my passions will not compare to the power of the Holy Spirit illuminating someone's
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.180]   heart.
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:01.340]   And therefore, we must pray.
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:06.580]   And that's why every single night when Bia and I put our boys to go to sleep, we pray
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.820]   a friend and we say, "May the Lord bless you with wisdom and instruction so that you will
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:14.540]   fear the Lord."
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:20.420]   I'm going to be faithful to teach my kids, and I will model what the Bible looks like
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.740]   in real life, and I will try to guard them and protect them.
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:33.060]   But we should be praying regularly that people hear the voice of God for themselves and that
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.340]   the Spirit empowers that.
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.340]   Amen?
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.920]   It won't compare.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:43.700]   And some people may falsely think that only if I said this and did this and then manipulated
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:49.020]   their lives so that you make this mold and you pour the child in and they come out perfect.
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.940]   That's not true.
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:54.820]   Scripture says we must pray, just as Apostle Paul.
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.040]   You guys are memorizing Scripture?
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.040]   This is a great one.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.860]   You know, rather than writing on Christmas cards and yearbooks or whatever, it's like,
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.580]   "Yeah, I hope you have a great summer."
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.940]   You know, write this.
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:10.740]   That God may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of Him.
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.020]   He'll open your heart and enlighten.
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.140]   This is a prayer for every Christian, right?
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.020]   This is a prayer for every Christian.
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.260]   Part three.
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:24.700]   What are some of the things that we really have to know?
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:30.180]   Apostle Paul doesn't just stop at, "I want you to know stuff, guys," period, right?
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.100]   He says, "No, we need to know what is the hope of His calling."
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.780]   And because of the limitations of our Bible study, I'm not going to be able to extrapolate
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.220]   all those things.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.100]   But did you notice how, again, organized he is?
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:44.460]   It's like, "I want you to have, you know, pray that God reveals to you, gives you the
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.420]   spirit of wisdom," right?
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.420]   And then all this stuff.
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:55.540]   And then he says that all of this is so that you would know what is the hope of His calling,
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:22:00.140]   what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance, what is the surpassing greatness of His power
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.740]   towards us who believe, right?
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.580]   I want to ask you a really interesting question.
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:09.220]   Every time you see a list, it's not always the case, but you should ask this question.
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:14.100]   Like, how are these things in the list joined together, right?
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.460]   So even here, you should ask.
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:19.180]   Later on, when we talk about the power of God in Christ, you should ask that question.
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.900]   Why are these examples cased together, right?
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.980]   Are they all privileges?
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:29.040]   Are they all just a continuation of the many blessings that we have?
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:33.100]   Are these all maybe resources for motivation for the believer?
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.980]   Are these great summaries of what we learned in verses 3 through 14?
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:41.820]   Are these the great foundations upon which we build our Christian lives?
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:42.820]   What are these?
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.700]   Okay, what are these?
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:50.740]   In my mind, as I kind of like reflected and meditated, so I want you guys to take a moment
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.140]   to meditate on this stuff.
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:23:00.700]   One of the greatest struggles in living life here is just to stay motivated.
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:05.200]   Right now, I'm preparing a sermon series for the single adults for our retreat coming up,
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.720]   how to live your life in the grind.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:12.900]   Where life is mundane, where work is heavy and your life is dominated by one facet of
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.540]   your life, what do you do, right?
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:21.900]   The reason why the grind is hard is because it's so hard to stay focused and motivated,
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.160]   yes?
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:29.940]   When I read this, there is nothing more motivating than this, right?
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.240]   These are the fuels for the Christian.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.240]   That's the way I see it.
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.100]   Now, someone, again, you can differ on that and people are like, "No, these are the blessings."
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.300]   These are blessings, okay?
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:47.800]   But I see nothing more motivating than to hear God has called you for an incredible
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:55.040]   purpose, to be his reflection, to be holy and blameless, and then to be his great treasure
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.580]   serving him in his heaven.
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.620]   Think about motivations, I mean, that's amazing.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:07.860]   To have the riches of the glory of his inheritance, what motivation for us?
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:12.460]   To see the surpassing greatness of his power?
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.060]   Meditate with me and flip it around the other way.
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:19.720]   If you did not have these motivations, what would you do, right?
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:24.400]   If you did not have these motivations of hope, the riches of glory, and of his great power,
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.400]   what would you do?
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:30.040]   I mean, life would be bleak.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:36.900]   Our table started talking about, it is sad, it is sad that in recent past, there has been
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:43.280]   stories of individuals taking their own lives, yet calling themselves followers of Christ.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.460]   They have forgotten this.
[00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.400]   If I have no hope, what's the point?
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.460]   If I have no point, if I have no hope, there is no direction.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.920]   What is this for?
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.160]   If I have no riches in Christ, then I am valueless.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.320]   What do I really have, right?
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.400]   What do I actually own?
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:08.340]   Even the stuff that I own, I can see it decay in my own lifetime.
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.160]   If there is no power, who do I trust?
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:16.360]   If there is no strength, then I am left to my own wit, and I have already seen how weak
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.360]   I am.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.320]   People who commit suicide are individuals who have seen their weakness and have given
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.940]   up.
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:32.660]   Without these great motivations in your life, your life is absolutely feeble, right?
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.240]   These are things to really meditate on.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:41.160]   Now, with that said, we want to move to that last section because that last section, it
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.760]   took a huge chunk of the space of a passage, right?
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:50.040]   So the beginning portions of it basically had his thankfulness and prayer, "I want you
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:56.120]   to have God's wisdom, His revelation and knowledge, and for you to know," right?
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.000]   And then he started listening, "I want you to know the hope, I want you to know the riches,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.900]   and I want you to know the power."
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.900]   And then right when he hit power, he stopped and pulled the brakes and said, "Let's talk
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.440]   about power.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:12.440]   Let's camp here and meditate on His power."
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:17.860]   Now I found something really interesting about this because he uses synonymous terms, right?
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:24.440]   There is this incredible, I love the way that NIV puts it, there's like this, he says, "Incomparably
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:28.480]   greatness," like it's a weird way of saying it in the NIV if you have it.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:33.220]   There's a surpassing greatness of His power, and then synonymously it says, "All of this
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.900]   in accordance with the working of the strength of His might."
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:37.900]   Wow.
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.120]   Like, think about it, right?
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:46.300]   God is a God who says a word and it is, but there is this exertion of His power that He
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.820]   exercises in Christ, yes?
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:53.140]   Let's read this section, it says, "These are in accordance with the working of the strength
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:57.020]   of His might, which He brought about in Christ."
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:02.080]   Now, notice how I put some of those He's in parentheses because I added that for emphasis,
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.080]   okay?
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.760]   And I also added it because, honestly, when I was doing my own Bible study, I was like,
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.720]   "Too many pronouns, who is who?"
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.560]   I'm pretty sure you guys might have felt the same way.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:18.120]   So then I started listing it, it says, "Look at God's power He brought about in Christ
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:24.720]   when He, He raised Him," that is Christ from the dead, "He seated Him at His right hand
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:30.400]   in the heavenly places far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and every
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:35.040]   name that is named, not only in this age, but also in the one to come.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:39.760]   And He put all things in subjection under His feet.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.860]   And He gave Him as head over all things to the church, which is His body and the fullness
[00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:48.040]   of Him who fills all in all."
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.900]   Okay, there's a lot there, there is a lot there.
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.800]   But as we think about that, I found something interesting.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.520]   Initially, you start thinking the might and power of God.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:05.320]   The Old Testament has so much to say about the might and power of God, right?
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.040]   There is creative power.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:13.640]   There is the power that God exerts where He brings into existence stuff out of nothing.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.640]   Yes?
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.880]   I've got a little chart for you.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:23.280]   There is even sustaining power where He holds all the things in the universe.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:27.920]   He holds them in place, Scripture says, right?
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:33.880]   Because if He so wishes, if He metaphorically just let go, right, things would absolutely
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.560]   go into decay.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.880]   And even scientists know that.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:42.720]   There is a rule, things do not go into order, they go into decay, right?
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.720]   What's more?
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.280]   There is the power of His wisdom.
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.360]   His knowledge is power.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.360]   Absolute.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:53.820]   Now, these samples are just a sampling of God's power exerted.
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.720]   So many times He'll say, "By my right hand, I've delivered you," right?
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.760]   "I've crushed nations."
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:01.760]   Interesting question.
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.920]   Why is none of this in this passage?
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:09.360]   I mean, this is great stuff.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.080]   We can talk tons.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:18.080]   He could have quoted O.T. so many times about the incredible excellencies of God's power.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.420]   Why?
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:27.720]   Because notice that when He is thinking about this power, that this power is God's power
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.800]   towards us in Christ.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:38.040]   There is this incredibly unique power that God is exercising.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:43.840]   I'm not sure if I can say that this is His greatest power, but this is an incredibly
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:49.320]   precise power that God is exercising towards you and me.
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:56.040]   For the individual who knows that he is a sinner apart from God, for the individual
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:01.440]   who's read ahead and chapter two says, "And you're dead and your chest passes," right?
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:07.600]   To hear that there is resurrection power, to hear that there is power to overcome, to
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:13.080]   hear that there is power to overcome the authorities, the powers, and the dominions, and the enslaving
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:21.440]   forces of your lusts of this world of Satan, your ears would perk, right?
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.440]   Why?
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:28.000]   Because this is power exercised towards me, the believer in Christ.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.600]   God exercises a unique power where through the work and person of Jesus, He is transforming
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:40.320]   billions, literally changing the lives of billions.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.440]   Radically filled with love.
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.120]   So this is amazing stuff.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.200]   This is amazing stuff.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:56.440]   Now as we meditate upon that then, we observe His, again, wise, incredibly meticulous, intentional,
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:01.360]   willful use of His power to exercise.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:09.000]   To me, this is absolutely radical because I took a moment to kind of think about this,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.800]   like how are we supposed to appreciate power, you know?
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.840]   And then for some odd reason, I started researching like how do you measure power?
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:21.480]   And then I went into this rabbit trail where I started researching like solar power for
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.960]   like a long time.
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:28.340]   Did you know that watts is calculated by amperage in volts?
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:33.400]   Now the really interesting thing about this is whenever you research power, any kind of
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:39.440]   power, there are different measurements of power, whether it be watts, kilowatts.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.960]   If you're researching furnaces or heaters or whatever, there's BTUs, and did you know
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.120]   that stands for British Thermal Units?
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.560]   I don't know what's up with that.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:53.760]   Now the figures that you see typically with BTUs and all this stuff, it's crazy numbers.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.400]   It's like this furnace has 80,000 BTUs, you know?
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.560]   It's like, "Whoa, 80,000," right?
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:09.320]   But every one of those measurements for power are conditioned by something per hour.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:15.180]   What's really interesting to me was as I think about this, like within this first chapter,
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:20.280]   one of the things that God highlighted within His like revelation of His acts and His works
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:28.400]   and His will and His redemptive power towards us is how eternal it was, right?
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.400]   That it spanned time.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.400]   I mean, our worldview is like this, like, "Did you think of me now?
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.840]   Are you helping me?"
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.440]   And then He shatters that and says, "I had you.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.280]   I chose you before the foundation of the world."
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.640]   But think about the timing of this.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:49.440]   If we're thinking and we're going to receive these blessings in Christ, when is that going
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.440]   to be?
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.240]   This is incredible stuff.
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.760]   Like radically challenging how we view the power exerted towards us.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:03.640]   And I wanted to at least try, just try to help you appreciate that as well.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:09.600]   Now in the last section, there is this one aspect of His power that's really interesting.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:15.640]   And He says on top of overcoming, there was a resurrection, there was a seating, like
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:20.200]   an authority, and then there was dominion over all powers and such.
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:24.160]   And then there was this last portion when He says, "And He gave Him as head over all
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:31.840]   things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all."
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:37.280]   I'm just going to tell you from the get-go, this is one jam-packed verse that there are
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.720]   still questions, right?
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:44.840]   And He's going to expand upon it in the future times to come, but I did want to say some
[00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:48.080]   things about it because you guys had some great questions.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:52.120]   I think it was essentially the question of, what does it mean, the fullness?
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.160]   Because that term is a little bit interesting.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.880]   All I'm going to say is this.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:03.440]   Believe it or not, when we see with our eyes, when we look at the church, we see a building
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.760]   with a bunch of people having service.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:16.680]   However, what Scripture is trying to say is that God has created this church, and over
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:20.440]   time, right, all of history passed.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:26.720]   God has established His church as a show of His power, right?
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.440]   And in magnificent ways.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:31.440]   I want to highlight for you a passage in Ephesians chapter 3.
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.440]   Please turn there.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.840]   Ephesians chapter 3, verse 8 through 10.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:46.040]   And He says this.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:52.240]   I'm going to actually start from verse 6 and go to verse 10.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:56.640]   He says, "To be specific, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:03.400]   body, the fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, of which
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.580]   I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace, which was given to me according
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.420]   to the working of His power.
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:15.400]   To me, the very least of all the saints, this grace was given to preach to the Gentiles
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:20.220]   the unfathomable riches of Christ, and to bring to light what is the administration
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:26.380]   of the mystery, which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things.
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:32.160]   So that," look at this, "the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:37.080]   church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:44.480]   This was in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.760]   That too is quite an incredible passage.
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.080]   But what I'm going to say is this.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.440]   The might of God is active in the church.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:58.560]   And so what I'm saying is when the passage says to you, right, because this passage says
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:05.360]   Christ is the head, He's ruling over, right, over all things in the church, and then there's
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:09.440]   an appositive saying this is His body, which is His body, and another appositive, the fullness
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.800]   of Him.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:17.160]   The way I'm taking it is the church is His body, is the fullness of Christ.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:21.800]   Not so meaning the completion of Him or that Jesus is lacking anything, but it's one of
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:27.960]   these ideas that's showing to you in marvelous fashion a representation of the great powers
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:31.360]   and majesties of our Lord and Savior, right?
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.600]   And that to us is quite a mystery.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.320]   We're just a bunch of people gathered together on a Wednesday night studying the Bible, but
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:44.720]   if you think about it, the power of God to draw us together in one singular person and
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.720]   name, right?
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:49.560]   It's an incredible power that He's displaying.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:53.720]   And the more and more is gonna be shown through the time, so we'll stop there.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:58.840]   Let's take a moment to pray and wrap up our session.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:04.720]   Lord, we thank you for your grace.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.360]   Thank you for your mercies.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:16.240]   God, we recognize that Apostle Paul, he was praying so fervently, unceasingly, because
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:22.400]   he saw the great value of the salvation we have in the Lord.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:28.520]   And what's more, Father God, he saw the importance that every believer would grow, would mature
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.520]   in the knowledge of the Lord.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:35.400]   And so I pray, Father God, that that would be also our earnest desire.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:40.000]   I pray, Father God, that also that that would be our heart's yearning, not just simply for
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.880]   those around us, but ourselves too.
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:49.440]   And I pray, Father God, that yes, if we are a church that's desiring to walk with you,
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:57.040]   to live according to the gospel, help us, Father God, to begin with the right understanding
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.420]   of you.
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:03.800]   Help us, Father God, to begin with deep appreciation for the gospel and to keep growing in the
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:08.800]   depth of the understanding that we would hold fast to the great treasure that we have.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.800]   We thank you, it's in Christ.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.800]   Let me pray.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.800]   Amen.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.800]   Okay.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:18.280]   I'm just going to take two minutes, because today I actually got a ton of messages from
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.380]   you guys on questions.
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:24.520]   And I wish that I was quick on my feet and I could just insert your questions into my
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:28.180]   lesson, but I can't do that.
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:31.680]   So I'm just going to take like two minutes at the end of the session to answer some of
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.760]   the questions, and then we'll kind of go from there, okay?
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.360]   I'm not going to say who the question's from, but I'll just ask the question.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.880]   Oh, this is a good one.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.080]   Oh, there's difference of translation, spirit of wisdom.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.560]   Sometimes the spirit is capitalized, sometimes the spirit is not.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.800]   What's the difference and why is that important?
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.800]   Okay, good.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:04.080]   You know, if you look at the passage, when Apostle Paul prays in verse 18, and he says
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:09.320]   that, oh, sorry, 17, that he may give you the spirit of wisdom.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.920]   I think we checked on our group.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:18.480]   I believe the only translation that says, oh, like, oh, sorry, that's not capitalized,
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.160]   and this is a spirit of wisdom is the NASV.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:25.320]   The NIV and the ESV are capitalized that.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:30.560]   Now, the reason why there's a difference is because when you take a look at a passage,
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:37.120]   remember that context is very important, and then the immediate contents of that passage
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.120]   is important.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.440]   So, one, context.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:45.520]   If you're looking at context, chapter one, that first section, had so much to say about
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.680]   the trinity affecting our redemption and the blessings that we have.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:53.680]   And right before this, it mentioned that the Holy Spirit was your seal.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:58.720]   And what's more, in the immediate context, there's this idea of, like, praying that the
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.120]   eyes of our heart may be what?
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.120]   Enlightened.
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.720]   Who does that?
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.320]   Scripture says the Holy Spirit, right?
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:10.840]   So by context, you can see why an interpreter would be like, the spirit, the pneuma, is
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.120]   the Holy Spirit giving you understanding.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.180]   And so they capitalize the word.
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:18.880]   But if you're looking at immediate content, you're kind of thinking, well, Apostle Paul
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.360]   is praying that you get knowledge.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.480]   The Spirit's already in you.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.600]   The Spirit's already working.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:28.280]   The Spirit's already, like, full, right, in your life, and you're walking with him.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.980]   What needs to happen, though, is you need wisdom.
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.200]   And so this could be more like the heart of wisdom.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:37.080]   This could be more like the essence of wisdom directing your life, right?
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:40.800]   And so you could tell where somebody's thinking, like, okay, this is more so on the lines of
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.840]   the contents of the prayer.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:46.680]   It's probably more so the spirit of wisdom on a general level, right?
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.160]   That you'll be walking in wisdom.
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.880]   Now is there a major difference between the two?
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:57.080]   In terms of impact for us, I think the thrust is the same, right?
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.720]   The thrust is the same.
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.520]   And so you don't have to think, like, oh, gosh, like, are we going to interpret something
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.720]   wrong?
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:09.320]   In the reading of the passage, the thrust of this section, verses 15 through 23, is
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:15.400]   a section on deep prayer, that our theology matters, our concept and view of God matters,
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:20.320]   our beliefs is going to what's going to drive later chapters of our application.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:24.800]   And so we have to be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, okay?
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.800]   Great question.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.800]   Okay.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:36.600]   If you guys have other questions, too, you guys can ask that kind of, okay, what is the
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.200]   nature of the inheritance?
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.560]   Ooh, okay.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.120]   Come up, several of you asked the same thing.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.800]   Okay, what is the nature of an inheritance?
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.840]   I'll do this one and let you guys discuss, okay?
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:53.920]   So where is that one?
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:59.280]   In verse 18, when he says, what is the hope of calling and what are the riches of the
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.640]   glory of his inheritance?
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:05.360]   If there was a comma right at what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance, I
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:09.640]   think it wouldn't have been confusing, but then it says in the saints, okay?
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:16.280]   What I mean is, when you guys do Bible interpretation, sometimes what's good is to lay down your
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.280]   options.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:23.640]   What I mean by that is, A, option A to read that is, okay, you should know the riches,
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:29.080]   this is a wealth, and this wealth is glorious, and this wealth is the inheritance God is
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.320]   going to give you.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.760]   That's plain reading, right?
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:38.400]   God is going to give you his own possession as a father would give his son.
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:44.900]   However, the passage says in the saints, and so someone might read the other option would
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:52.840]   be the riches of the glory of his inheritance, which is God is getting his possession of
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:43:00.600]   the saints, meaning the bucket of riches that is being gained is us, right?
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:05.280]   There are passages in scripture in a larger, broader context that actually say, just like
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:10.440]   Jesus says in the gospels, those that my father has given to me, apostle Paul is preparing
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.980]   a bride that will be presented to the Lord.
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:18.240]   God is going to present us as a church, holy and blameless to Christ at the end of days.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.080]   Is it consistent with the scriptures?
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.440]   Yes, okay?
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:29.000]   Now, the way that I'm looking at this, though, is one part.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:36.080]   Should a Christian be super, super amazed and enriched that God would see you as his
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.520]   own possession, right?
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.680]   You should.
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:46.400]   That is like a truth that to me is mind baffling.
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.360]   I don't know how to describe it.
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.360]   Part of it seems almost ridiculous.
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.600]   There are certain truths in the gospels, just like ridiculous, right?
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:44:01.480]   It's like Ephesians 2 says, "You're children of wrath, lustful, wicked, walking with all
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.480]   kind," like disobedience, right?
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:06.880]   You're just like the most wicked thing in the world.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:12.760]   And then for God to say, "I want you to be my treasured possession," right?
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:15.200]   It's just crazy, okay?
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.900]   Could that be the case?
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:23.200]   I would say, again, it is consistent with the broader context of scripture, so okay.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:29.080]   But what makes more sense to me here is because I am seeing in context, it is pinched between
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:35.140]   the hope of his calling, so he's calling us, the riches of his glory, and then so some
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:40.040]   of the prepositions, although it says, "in the saints," and in the Greek it is, "in the
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:45.880]   saints," and then what's more, the surpassing exercise of his power towards the believer,
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:51.920]   it kind of still runs the line, I guess, benefits and motivations for the Christian, right?
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.520]   Blessings for the Christian, so to speak.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:56.980]   And so I would like to translate it, or at least just take it as, this is the riches
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:00.460]   of his glory that he has for the saints, right?
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:03.440]   Now is that something I can put my foot down and say, "That's the right one"?
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:09.560]   I just kind of explained to you, you can kind of see both angles, but in context, in the
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:14.240]   immediate paragraph, it makes more sense that this is the inheritance that we receive, okay?
