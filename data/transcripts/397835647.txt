[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Good morning, everybody.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.240]   Well, it's a blessing to be able to sing those powerful words and to give our Lord just some
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.520]   worship together.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.440]   For those of you who are joining us for the very first time, I want to welcome you warmly.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.520]   After the service is done, please do visit right outside.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.880]   There's a welcome table, and our welcome team members would love to greet you, answer some
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.040]   questions that you may have, and I'll tell you just more about our church.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.560]   So please, again, after the service is done, please stop by.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.520]   So as you guys are well aware, pertaining to what's happening at church, there are things
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.800]   that have been postponed definitively, and then there are a lot of things that are tentative.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.400]   And so I'll be going over some of those things.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.480]   Importantly, for today's service, as we continue to just practice the things that are recommended,
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.360]   whether it be the distance, the washing of hands, there are sanitizer bottles right at
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.360]   the entrance.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.080]   Today, for offering time, we're going to be having two ways that you could be doing
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.080]   your offering.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.740]   So the first is to submit your offering via the online format, and we have various ways
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.080]   that you can do that.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.160]   And the second is to come up to the front at the end of the service when the service
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.160]   is done.
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.320]   We have two boxes at the front for those of you who have prepared your checks.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.560]   So again, up on the screen, there are the account information for both Venmo, that's
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.520]   also the Chase QuickPay there.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.560]   And so again, please refer to those things, okay?
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.640]   Importantly, for midweek Bible study, our Wednesday meeting that we normally have is
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.640]   going to be moved online.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.040]   And so likewise for the home groups, the recording will happen on Tuesday.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.580]   So I'm going to be recording the actual Bible study with various questions and preparing
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.720]   a handout that will be distributed online.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.200]   And then the groups and small groups can choose to meet together if possible, even in pairs
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.400]   if possible.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.280]   But the whole idea is just to continue the efforts to make sure we're going through Scripture
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.320]   together, discussing together our reflections, and just our reflections of application as
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.320]   well.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.960]   So please just put forth your best effort to, whether it be to discuss, again, in a
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.880]   much smaller pocket or whatnot, to again move our Bible study on to the online, okay?
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.880]   Coming up next Saturday, we're going to be doing a spring cleaning.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.760]   We're very grateful for all of you guys who showed up yesterday to sanitize the church,
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.800]   all the door handles, the switches, they were all wiped down with Lysol and our cleaning
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.040]   solution.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.800]   But we're going to be doing a cleaning next Saturday, and that's going to be held, and
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.940]   we're going to do a second round of that.
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.540]   In terms of the other events, for example, there is supposed to be a baptism info session
[00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.860]   at the end of the month.
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.860]   That's going to be postponed.
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.320]   Likewise, unfortunately, the gospel night that was scheduled for April 4th, that is
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.120]   also being postponed until further notice.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.400]   So please continue to stay up to speed on our various announcements and sites so that
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.360]   you can know what events are happening.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.800]   At this time, Pastor Peter Kim will come to deliver us the word.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.040]   All right, good morning.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.840]   Let me pray for us before we begin.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:17.920]   Heavenly Father, we pray, especially in these special times for wisdom and guidance.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:25.480]   Lord, we need to hear your wisdom, your guidance, your Holy Spirit to lead us in our thinking,
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.800]   in our feelings, in our lives and decision making, especially now.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.040]   So we pray, Father, that you would help us to cut through the clutter in our lives and
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.280]   to focus our hearts and minds on you and you alone.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.540]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.800]   We are very aware that there are probably more churches closed today than are open.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.200]   And I know a handful of churches that are having services today, but most of the churches
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.240]   that I'm aware of have already made a decision to close.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.960]   I want to give you some background information because there's a lot of talk, a lot of stuff
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.220]   going on online just to kind of let you know our thinking process and what pattern that
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.440]   we're following.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.740]   And there is a possibility, again, because this is progressing pretty quickly, that we
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.600]   may make a decision, again, to not have the service next Sunday.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   So it's week to week.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.820]   So please stay online and check your emails as often as you can.
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.020]   If you can put up that...
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.860]   Okay.
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.620]   So if you don't have Facebook, for whatever the reason, I ask you to get it.
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:43.740]   But if you do, I mean, obviously if you don't have it, we have emails and smoke snacks.
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.140]   It's different stuff that we can use to communicate with you.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.980]   But those of you who do have Facebook, you probably saw this already.
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.220]   And this is the reasoning behind what we're doing.
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.860]   If you look at it, the first stage, and again, let me tell you where this is from.
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:05.660]   This is from a missionary doctor who was actually very intimately involved with the SARS outbreak.
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.740]   And he was in Beijing.
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.220]   And so he was in the context of not only dealing with the information and the spread of SARS,
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.260]   but which was at that time, which was a lot more deadly than what's going on right now.
[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.100]   At least if you did get it.
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.220]   But to apply that in the church, like how we ought to respond to that.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.220]   And so he made this chart.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.600]   And I thought this was, of all the things that I saw, this was the most helpful.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.140]   The first stage was there's no cases in my community, which is not where we are.
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.580]   We passed that several weeks ago.
[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.100]   The second stage is there are cases in my community, but cases are all imported from
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.260]   another area or contracts, again, imported from other.
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.540]   Which means that somebody from the outside who had it came into the community, which
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.700]   was the case until recently.
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:57.900]   The third is there are one or more cases that do not have contacts to a known case, multiple
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.540]   generations of transmissions.
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.460]   Meaning that somebody who contracted it was independent of somebody that came, or at least
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.860]   they can't directly connect it.
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.620]   And there's multiple layers of generations that they gave it to somebody, and then they
[00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.380]   gave it to somebody else, and there's generations of this.
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.700]   The first case that they found of somebody that they can't trace from outside was found
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.480]   Thursday.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.600]   So meaning that according to this chart, we're at not green, not yellow, but the beginning
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.460]   of the red.
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.740]   According to all the facts, most likely this is going to grow exponentially within the
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.580]   next days or weeks.
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.900]   So we're not naive to think that this is not going to happen, but we are at stage three.
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.820]   And so we have moved from stage three in caution to stage four, which is what we're doing right
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.820]   now.
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.940]   We are asking people to take precautions, the Bible studies that, again, you know, that
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.420]   we're going to try to go online as much as possible and distance ourselves, sanitize
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.100]   everything, giving instructions.
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.540]   We're doing everything that we can.
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:03.220]   And then if by chance that this does progress, we need to go to stage five, which is basically
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.280]   shut down everything, everything's going online, right?
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.540]   We will give that information as soon as we feel the need to do that.
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.900]   The question is, why didn't we just completely go online to begin with?
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:20.300]   Why didn't we go from stage one to stage five just out of precaution?
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:27.020]   Because there are more things to consider than just our safety.
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:33.300]   According to Orange County Health, not what's going on in Wuhan and Italy and even San Francisco,
[00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:39.460]   but according to Orange County Health Organization, they say that our risk at this time today
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.460]   is pretty low.
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.880]   The number of people who have contracted it versus the number of people who live in Orange
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.580]   County is one to 500,000.
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.980]   Obviously, that number is going to grow.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.780]   So we need to be careful that we are not panicking, that we highly value the gathering of the
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:02.340]   people, that we are not just reacting to the information that we are hearing.
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.620]   And we are not naive to think that, "Oh, this is nothing.
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.100]   It's like a common flu and that we're kind of treating it like it's nothing."
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.140]   That is not the case.
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:17.900]   The leaders are in communication as often as we can, multiple times during the day,
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.700]   every information that we get, every article that is sent to us, we read it thoroughly
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:26.560]   and we are examining carefully, how do we balance between the high call of the gathering
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.220]   of the believers with what's going on around us?
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.260]   Again, as it progresses, we will let you know.
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:40.100]   But those of you who are sitting in these seats, these seats are interlocked for a reason.
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.380]   When our church was being built, the fire department came and one of the requirements
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:52.620]   were that the aisles needed to be a certain size, a distance, and every seat in the sanctuary
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.100]   had to have a certain distance to an exit that goes directly outside.
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.340]   So they had all these rules that we had to follow.
[00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.580]   And I was able to understand all of that except for the interlocking of the chairs.
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:06.660]   I said, "If there's an emergency, wouldn't it be easier if the chairs didn't interlock
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.060]   and we're able to immediately move it and then everybody can run?"
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.880]   And he said, "That's exactly the reason why they need to interlock because according to
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.900]   their experience, when fire breaks out, people panic.
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.260]   And when they panic, they don't act irrationally.
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.380]   So they end up jumping over chairs.
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.140]   They're not going to get in a neat line and then march their way outside.
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.780]   So they're going to be pushing themselves and trying to get over the chairs.
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.640]   And in that process, what ends up happening is all the chairs that fall down and it blocks
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:43.700]   the entrances and more people die from the stampede than they do from the fire itself."
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.940]   That's natural human behavior.
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:52.700]   And so we're trying to be careful that we are not reacting to all the information that
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.700]   we are hearing.
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.980]   According to what we have heard, that we are still...
[00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:01.280]   It is still a low risk that's most likely going to move to a higher risk.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.980]   If you go to Costco, it is still open.
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.460]   The City Hall is still open.
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.480]   Most of the restaurants are still open.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.180]   And so Disneyland just closed.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.560]   From what I heard yesterday, it closed.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.420]   So slowly we are getting there, but we didn't want to make a...
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:21.520]   We didn't want to overreact and go from level two to level five because we wanted to make
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.580]   sure that we highly value what it is that you and I are doing.
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:30.140]   So we made it an option to have the families with small children in order to thin out the
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:37.380]   crowd and in order to protect the most vulnerable in our church, even though the risk for them
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.220]   is probably lower.
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.740]   For that purpose, we wanted to thin it out.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.440]   The government said no gatherings of 250 or more.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.380]   So we're trying to honor that by thinning the group out.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:54.980]   And we're going to do our best to sanitize, keep our distance, not have food.
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.620]   All the stuff that we can go online, we will go online.
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.220]   All the stuff that we can't even do that, we will cancel for the time being.
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.540]   We don't know how long this is going to take.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.540]   It might take a month.
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.260]   It might take two months.
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.940]   But my guess is in about a month, we will be much worse off than we are today.
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:16.500]   So our concern is if we go too quickly to the end part, we're going to be at that point
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.860]   from possibly two months, three months, four months and on.
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.780]   And so we want to be careful that we are taking proper steps, that we are not reacting to
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.260]   what's going on around us.
[00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:32.620]   There is tremendous pressure on all of us in the leadership to follow the herd and go.
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:36.900]   But we want to make sure that we are communicating properly.
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:44.060]   I want to start off by looking at this text in Mark chapter 4, 35 to 41.
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:48.060]   I'm going to be giving an overview of the book of Hebrews.
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.980]   And I told you that we're at chapter 7.
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.140]   We're going to be talking about Melchizedek.
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:56.020]   But I'm not sure if I'm going to be getting to the Melchizedek next week.
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.340]   And the reason why is because there are many people at home with their children having
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.740]   service together.
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:05.060]   And my guess is they have no idea who Melchizedek is.
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:10.860]   Unless you've done a fantastic job and they want to know the intricacies of the Trinity
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.720]   and Melchizedek right away.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.840]   But my guess is most of your children will not be.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.620]   So because we want to be sensitive to the families that are home watching the videos
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:26.740]   together that hopefully our services will be, you know, like it'll be relevant to them
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:27.740]   as well.
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.860]   So we want to be sensitive to that.
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.940]   No guarantee we could still be jumping into Melchizedek.
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:37.980]   But again, we might just wait a few more weeks and we'll see how things go.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.920]   Mark chapter 4, 35.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:46.020]   This is the scene where the disciples and Jesus are on the Sea of Galilee and Jesus
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.980]   is so fatigued and tired that he falls asleep on this boat.
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:55.860]   And while he is on the boat, a tremendous storm comes and they freak out.
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.740]   But I want to go over the text with you.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.740]   It's verse 35.
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:03.260]   "On that day when evening came, he said to them, 'Let us go over to the other side.'
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.580]   Leaving the crowd, they took him along with them in a boat just as he was and other boats
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.020]   were with him.
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:13.700]   And there arose a fierce gale of wind and the waves were breaking over the boat so much
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.660]   so that the boat was already filling up."
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.660]   Let me stop right there.
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:26.340]   Before we jump to conclusion that these disciples are weak and that they were fearful, you have
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.340]   to realize that this is happening at the Sea of Galilee.
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:35.740]   Sea of Galilee is where Paul, John, Andrew, you know, those four brothers, this is their
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:36.740]   hometown.
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.780]   They are professional fishermen.
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:44.100]   And at that time, professional fishermen usually were inherited.
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.140]   Their job was usually inherited by their parents, probably maybe their grandparents.
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:50.100]   I don't know how many generations it goes.
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.300]   But these guys are lifelong fishermen.
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:57.700]   And this Sea of Galilee is where they did most of their work.
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:02.460]   So the fact that the storm came in and that they were afraid because the water was coming
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:07.500]   into the boat, it is understandable that they are freaking out.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:12.220]   Because if anybody would know if this storm was going to lead to death or not, it would
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.760]   have been them.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.940]   So the fact that they were freaking out and they were scared, and they looked to Jesus
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:23.480]   who happens to be sleeping at the end, at the stern.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.580]   And stern is basically at the end of the boat.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.500]   And most likely in a small boat, that's where the rudder was.
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.700]   The boat traditionally at that time, they said it's about probably about 30 feet and
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.140]   about 7 1/2 feet wide.
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.900]   So it wasn't a huge boat, just enough to fit the disciples and Jesus.
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:46.300]   And Jesus in the midst of the storm is sitting back there and he's sleeping.
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:51.300]   And they're freaking out and they go to Jesus, "Jesus, how can you do this?"
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.500]   Again, verse 38, "Jesus himself was in the stern, asleep in the cushion.
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:01.020]   And they woke him and said to him, 'Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?'"
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.980]   Now they are saying this for two reasons.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.340]   One, because Jesus is their leader.
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.780]   So they're asking their leader, "How can you be sleeping while we might die?"
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.180]   But the other reason is Jesus is at the stern.
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.740]   He may have been in control of the rudder.
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.180]   "What are you doing?
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.060]   We're about to die."
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:27.460]   But when Jesus wakes up from this, I mean, there isn't a meeting, there isn't like a
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.460]   teaching.
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.820]   He just gets up and he says, "Hush," verse 39.
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.380]   He rebuked the wind and he said to the sea, "Hush, be still."
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:39.240]   And the wind died down and it became perfectly calm.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.540]   So there was no work being done.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.620]   All Jesus did was, "Done."
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.300]   Instantaneously gone.
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.340]   Instead of apologizing to the disciples, "Oh, I was so tired."
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:56.620]   I mean, imagine how tired Jesus was that in the midst of a storm that may cause him to
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:01.860]   drown and everybody else is freaking out and Jesus is tired.
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.140]   That's how human he was.
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.140]   That's what his ministry looked like.
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.060]   And we get a glimpse into his humanity.
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:14.360]   But instead of apologizing, he turns the table around and he says, "Why are you afraid?
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.580]   Do you still have no faith?"
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:23.100]   Now again, humanly speaking, who wouldn't be afraid?
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:30.640]   I mean, these are professional fishermen in the Sea of Galilee, in their own boat.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.900]   They know what they can handle, what they cannot handle.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:38.280]   Really, this was a danger that they needed to deal with.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:44.300]   But instead, Jesus says, "Why are you afraid?"
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:49.420]   Verse 41 says, "They became very much afraid and said to one another, 'Who then is this
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.300]   that even the wind and the sea obey him?'"
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:17:01.620]   See, what we see here and the reason why he turns it around and says to them and rebukes
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.240]   them, "Why were you afraid?
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.740]   Do you not have faith?"
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:11.020]   What he was asking was, "Do you not recognize who is at the rudder?"
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.580]   The problem was not the storm.
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:13.580]   The problem was not them.
[00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:15.900]   The problem was not the boat.
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.260]   This was no ordinary storm.
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.780]   This was no ordinary leader sitting at the rudder.
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:25.900]   So what they were questioning and what he was asking was, "In the midst of all of this,
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.060]   do you not know who I am?"
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.940]   That's what he was asking.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:37.040]   The difference between this storm, the difference between this danger is that Jesus was in control.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.840]   And that's why he turned the tables and he rebuked them.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:49.480]   Now, when we're living in a time of peace, we can imagine, but the world is freaking
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.480]   out right now.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.360]   I mean, there's all kinds of news.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:59.160]   I mean, obviously, we have two very extreme responses and less and less people are responding
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.160]   on one end.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.960]   We have one end that if we change anything, we're foolish.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.520]   And I think less and less people feel that way.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.800]   But we have a growing number of people that think that we're in the midst of Armageddon.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:18.000]   That if we don't stockpile seven years of toilet paper, that you don't get enough Purell
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.200]   for the rest of your life, that you're never going to survive.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.820]   We have that end.
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:31.200]   We have to be careful that in the midst, especially in the midst of turmoil, that we don't react
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.120]   like the rest of the world.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:40.380]   Because our greatest fear should not be catching this disease.
[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:45.620]   Our greatest fear should not be if you caught it, that you're going to die from it.
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:50.640]   If you notice that when Jesus wakes up and he calms the storm, the tremendous fear that
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:57.120]   they had of this storm turned into fear of who?
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.200]   Of Christ.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.200]   Fear of God.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:05.220]   And the Bible says that beginning of wisdom is fear of the Lord.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.440]   Beginning of wisdom.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.700]   We want to be wise.
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.640]   We want to be careful.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.600]   We don't want to be naive.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.920]   We want to take what's happening around the world.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:21.160]   And we want to be wise in making sure that the fear of the Lord is the foundation upon
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:26.280]   which we are building and which we are making decisions.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:31.740]   The book of Hebrews is written to a group of people who are in dire situation.
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.440]   It was written around 65 to 69 AD.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.320]   Some of you guys who know Roman history know that the Christian persecution happened right
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.480]   around that time.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.840]   All those things that you see on movies where Christians are taken to Colosseum and tigers,
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.400]   I mean lions are tearing them apart.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.580]   This happened during that period, 65 to 69 AD.
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:56.280]   If you were with us in the study of the book of Romans, you know that Paul was captured
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.800]   in Jerusalem in AD 59.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:04.600]   He was in Jerusalem for two years and then he was taken to Rome as a prisoner between
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.040]   AD 61 to AD 63.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:13.240]   Meaning for that period of time, the Romans were the ones who were guarding Paul.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.480]   Do you remember that?
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:20.680]   Paul came into Jerusalem to preach the gospel and the Jews were so angered they wanted to
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.840]   stone him to death.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.400]   It was the Roman guards that came in to protect him.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:31.480]   And under their protection, he was under house arrest and his friends were able to come.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.240]   He was writing letters and he was preaching the gospel.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.280]   So if you remember, as he was writing the book of Philippians, he says, "This has turned
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.320]   out for the spreading of the gospel."
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.600]   Other people are more emboldened because of his chains.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.840]   But that was between AD 59 to AD 63.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:55.720]   What these believers are experiencing now was much different.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:01.520]   In fact, when the persecution initially came, they were very strong, just like in the book
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.520]   of Philippians.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.080]   They were more emboldened to preach the gospel because the Romans were actually protecting
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.080]   them.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:13.320]   By the time Paul writes 2 Timothy, the atmosphere has changed.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.700]   The Nero's persecution had become intense.
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.760]   And that's the background behind the writing of the book of Hebrews.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:26.840]   In fact, Tacitus, if you can put up the next section, Tacitus, who is a Roman official,
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:32.960]   and he's one of the most revered Roman historians, who was not a Christian.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:38.200]   He was a contemporary of the emperor Nero, and he was writing his observation of what
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.480]   was going on with the Christians.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:44.040]   And this gives us insight as to the intensity of the persecution that these Roman Christians
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.200]   were experiencing at this time.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:52.560]   He says, "Yet no human effort, no princely largesse, nor offerings of the gods could
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:57.560]   make that infamous rumor disappear that Nero had somehow ordered the fire."
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:02.560]   It was a big fire that broke out in Rome, and in order to escape blame, he said that
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.280]   the Christians did it.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:09.200]   And so Tacitus already was suspecting that maybe Nero did it himself.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.560]   Therefore, in order to abolish that rumor, Nero falsely accused and executed with the
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:19.800]   most exquisite punishment those people called Christians, who were infamous for their abominations.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:25.160]   The originator of the name, Christ, was executed as a criminal by procurator Pontius Pilate
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.880]   during the reign of Tiberius.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:32.880]   And though repressed, this destructive superstition erupted again, not only through Judea, which
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:38.080]   was the origin of this evil, but also through the city of Rome, to which all that is horrible
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.600]   and shameful floods together and is celebrated.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:45.840]   In other words, Tacitus is already saying that if any horrible things are going to happen,
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.360]   it would happen in Rome because they have a reputation for this.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:54.440]   Therefore, first, those were seized who admitted their faith.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.920]   Let me stop right there.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.680]   He's describing the persecution, and he said the first group of people were people who
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.440]   are openly sharing their faith.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.960]   That's usually how persecution begins.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:11.120]   If you stay quiet, stay in your house, and you're not outside doing God's work, there
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.680]   is no need for persecution.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:16.800]   So the first group of people were most likely missionaries who were outside sharing their
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.800]   faith.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:23.680]   And he says they were the ones who were first seized, and then using the information they
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:28.640]   provided, a vast multitude were convicted.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:33.480]   So right now, all the missionaries out in China who's been there for five to ten years,
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:37.920]   they're the ones who are in greatest danger, and they are being protected because once
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:42.640]   they get in and they get interrogated, they're concerned that they're going to end up finding
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.400]   other people that are connected to them.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.580]   So that's exactly how persecution works.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.360]   That's what's going on in China and different parts of the world.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:54.120]   And he says the first intense persecution happened the same way.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.280]   It was through the people who are openly admitting their faith, they used the information they
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:03.000]   provided, and they went after the people who were connected to them.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.320]   Not so much for the crime of burning the city, but for hatred of human race.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.240]   And perishing, they were additionally made into sports.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:17.360]   Their persecution was made an entertainment to the Romans.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:22.160]   They were killed by dogs by having the hides of beasts attached to them, or they were nailed
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.320]   to crosses or set aflame.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.560]   When the daylight passed away, they were used as nighttime lamps.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.900]   Let me stop right there.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.820]   They made the persecution an entertainment for the Roman citizens.
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:40.900]   They would crucify them, allow dogs and beasts to tear them apart, and people would pay money
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.900]   to come and see this.
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:47.060]   And then when they were crucified, they would set them aflame, and not only did they die
[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:54.140]   because of this, Nero decided that he was going to light his garden with these people
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.180]   who are burning.
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.560]   This is how ridiculous.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.120]   This is the background behind the letter of the book of Hebrews.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.520]   And when the daylight passed away, they were used as nighttime lamps.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:09.160]   Nero gave his own gardens for his spectacle and performed a circus game in the habit of
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:14.640]   charioteer mixing with the plebs or driving about the race course.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.920]   Even though they were clearly guilty and merited being made the most recent example of consequences
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.920]   of crime, people began to pity these sufferers.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.880]   Part of the reason why revival broke out in the first century is because the sentiment
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:34.720]   toward the Christians began to change because the Romans were so cruel to the Christians.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.400]   Because they were consumed not for public good, but on account of the fierceness of
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.400]   one man.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.480]   Again, it's an indictment against Nero.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:46.280]   That gives us a background behind what was historically being observed by even other
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.080]   Romans.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.760]   That's the background behind the book of Hebrews.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:59.160]   So when he tells them, the author of Hebrews tells them, "Do not neglect gathering together,"
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.680]   that was the background.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:07.560]   Now our present circumstance is not the same, and I'm not making that connection because
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.540]   the churches are not shutting down for that reason.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.120]   It's for safety reasons, making sure that the virus does not spread.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:22.480]   But we want to make sure that whatever decision that we make, that we place the high value
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.760]   of gathering together for those who are able to come.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.040]   That we want to make sure that when it is necessary, which it seems like we are headed
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:36.320]   toward that direction, that when that decision is made, that there is no confusion, the high
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:41.080]   priority of what we are doing, because even the government has the warning that they gave
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:47.480]   was 250 people or more, that is not essential.
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:54.320]   And we consider the gathering of the believers essential, that the closing of Disneyland
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.360]   should not equate to what we are doing.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:03.960]   Again, we are headed there, and maybe as early as this week, we may have to do so because
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:07.700]   we want to abide by the government and what is happening around us.
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.000]   But we don't want to panic.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.180]   We don't want to knock over chairs.
[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:15.560]   We don't want people to go to supermarkets and buy stuff that the elderly is in need
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.460]   of.
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:22.800]   We want to make sure that we are being prayerful, that we are anchored in Christ, that at the
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.840]   end of all of this, whether it's two months, three months, or five months from now, that
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:33.920]   our values are going to stay intact.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:42.600]   It was written, this letter was written, and he says, the letter itself describes them,
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:46.360]   Hebrews chapter 10, 32, "But remember the former days when after being enlightened,
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:51.120]   you endured a great conflict of suffering, partly by being made a public spectacle through
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:56.140]   reproaches and tribulations, and partly by becoming shares with those who were so treated.
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:01.480]   For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property."
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:06.480]   If this was written by Paul, he may be referring to them coming and visiting Paul, giving him
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.240]   stuff, giving gifts.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:14.160]   Even if it wasn't written by Paul, Paul says that this group was a very good group.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.640]   They were committed Christians.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:21.920]   But when the heat got turned up, they began to run.
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:28.660]   So he is reminding them, the whole letter is reminding them, in the midst of this intense
[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:35.320]   situation to make sure that you are anchored in Christ.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.800]   We need to be anchored in Christ in every situation, whether it is in peace, whether
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:45.520]   it's in turmoil, but especially in times when we are surrounded by people who are in dire
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:53.040]   need of security, that we do not act like the world, that our security doesn't come
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:59.800]   from having a stockpile of Purell in our garage, that if we just keep the distance from everybody,
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:05.080]   if we just don't get the coronavirus, we are safe.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.380]   That is not our safety.
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.880]   That is not our hope.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.140]   That is not our peace.
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:15.880]   We need to do everything that we should do as good citizens, as good neighbors, to love
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:20.560]   the people around us, to submit to the authority.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.720]   But our greatest hope is always in Christ.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:30.180]   If there's any time where that needs to be emphasized, it is now.
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.420]   Are we anchored in Christ as a church?
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.260]   Are we anchored in Christ in our homes?
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.060]   Are we anchored in Christ individually?
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.200]   Are we anchored in Christ in our friendship?
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:44.420]   Are we anchored in Christ in the way we treat our neighbors?
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:51.580]   While it is our natural instinct to be concerned over ourselves and our children, is the anchoring
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:56.300]   of Christ causing us to act differently than the world?
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:00.660]   The author constantly encourages us all throughout the book of Hebrews to not to drift, to be
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.660]   anchored in Christ.
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.120]   Hebrews chapter 2, verse 1.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:09.080]   For this reason, we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.080]   Why do we need to pay much closer attention?
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.460]   Because of what was going on.
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.500]   Because of the persecution.
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.340]   Because of the threat of death.
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:22.380]   You were paying attention, but now you must pay much closer attention.
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.580]   Christ was always important to us.
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.260]   He was always our foundation.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:30.940]   The gospel was always precious, but much more now.
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:35.740]   He says much more now, pay much closer attention to what you have heard so that we do not drift
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.520]   away from it.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.700]   How is the gospel that we profess?
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:45.420]   How are the values that we profess, the heaven that we talk about that we're going to go
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.360]   to that we're eagerly waiting for?
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:54.060]   How does all of that information that we profess, how does it affect the way that we make decisions?
[00:30:54.060 --> 00:31:00.380]   The way we treat our neighbors, what we do in the midst of all of this.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.460]   Hebrews chapter 2, 3.
[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:05.260]   How will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.020]   You know what he means by neglect?
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.980]   Neglect can happen in two ways.
[00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.940]   One, simply by doing nothing.
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:15.200]   Just sit on the boat and let the current take the boat wherever it goes.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:19.720]   But another way that we end up drifting is by making small compromises.
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:24.300]   In this particular situation, just, "Is that really that important?
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.660]   Do we really need to do that?
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:26.660]   What about this?"
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:31.260]   And we have a tendency to rationalize disobedience if we're not careful.
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:37.820]   And so when he says, "Make sure that we are not neglecting, that compromising and justification
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:44.820]   isn't happening in our mind for the purpose of our own protection."
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:45.820]   Hebrews chapter 3, 12.
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:50.460]   "Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.100]   that falls away from the living God."
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:57.340]   Over and over again, he says, "Do not neglect, do not neglect, do not neglect, do not let
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.940]   it yourself drift."
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.260]   So we need to be anchored in Christ.
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.440]   Being anchored in Christ doesn't mean that you have to show up at church.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.740]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:09.140]   I think it's a great opportunity, especially for those of you families who are at home
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:13.340]   with your children, to share the gospel with your kids, to talk about the worship, talk
[00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.340]   about the songs.
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.660]   It's a great opportunity to establish that if that wasn't there.
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:21.220]   Talk about Melchizedek.
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.220]   Disciple your children.
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.520]   It's a great opportunity.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:27.260]   But it's Christ at the center of all of this.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.720]   When we tend to neglect our salvation and we allow ourselves to drift, the first place
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:35.060]   where that shows is the way that we treat our neighbors.
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:41.860]   That's why he says in Hebrews 13.2, "Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers.
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.580]   For by this some have entertained angels without knowing it."
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:51.740]   And again, Hebrews 13.16, "And do not neglect doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.900]   God is pleased."
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:33:00.340]   Remember, remember what he said about this church previously, how they endured great
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:03.940]   conflict that even made public spectacles.
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.000]   They showed sympathy, visited prisoners.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.300]   They did all of this at one point.
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:16.740]   But they're telling them, "Don't neglect it now while this persecution is going on.
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:24.100]   While our natural inclination is to be in our shell, me and my family only."
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:29.580]   And that's why he's telling them in that context, "Do not neglect to show hospitality towards
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:31.380]   strangers."
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.980]   The most vulnerable people in our society right now are the elderly.
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.460]   Because if you look at the chart of people who contracted and who are getting seriously
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:45.180]   ill, and possibly even dying, the chart goes from almost negligible to young people to
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:50.540]   very dangerous to old people, people who are 70 and older in our society.
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:54.420]   People who are 70 and older in our society don't usually use internet.
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.100]   I know some people in their 50s, right?
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:00.300]   But people in their 70s, 80s usually don't know, so they don't know what's going on.
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.180]   They're hearing it through the grapevine or through television.
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:07.820]   And we are hearing more and more stories of the elderly who are showing up to supermarkets
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.940]   with nothing.
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:11.200]   They can't find toilet paper.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:15.740]   They can't find just daily necessities.
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:20.500]   To love our neighbors shouldn't just be to isolate ourselves.
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.580]   Obviously, we need to be wise.
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:26.460]   We need to do what we need to do to take care of our families, make sure that this doesn't
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.460]   spread.
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:32.660]   But loving our neighbors in the context of struggle shouldn't just be protecting our
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:33.860]   families.
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:37.700]   It's a great opportunity to practice this agape love.
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:43.300]   While everybody else is running from danger, God may be calling the church to run to danger
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:47.540]   in certain contexts to see who are in need.
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:54.400]   Those of you who have 70 years of toilet paper, I encourage you to give up some.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:59.380]   See if these senior homes that are around us are running out.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:04.720]   If you have enough Purell to last until Jesus comes, look around you.
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.860]   Maybe there are neighbors who don't have any.
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:14.220]   If you have more food than you can handle, that if this virus goes for another 10 years,
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:19.060]   you're safe, then maybe you can look around and see if there are some people who don't
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:24.020]   have access to this, that this is the perfect time to use the resources that we have to
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.740]   share the love of Christ with them.
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:31.800]   That's what he is saying, that in the context of all of this, do not neglect to show hospitality
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:32.800]   to strangers.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.900]   Do not neglect to doing good and sharing.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:41.600]   Do not neglect the very core of our identity, be put in the back burner because we are concerned
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.540]   about our own safety.
[00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:46.820]   This is the time to really glorify Christ.
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.140]   We're talking about the agape love, right?
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:54.780]   The end result of all of this, in fact, chapter 13 ends with, if you believe this and you
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:59.260]   practice faith and you look upon Christ who is the often perfecter of our faith, chapter
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:03.180]   13 ends with, "Therefore, practice this agape love."
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:10.100]   If there's any time where that needs to come to the forefront of our lives, it is now.
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.500]   You know, we've been working hard.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:16.680]   We have our outreach team who's been working hard to set up the gospel night, and I know
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.900]   that many are disappointed because they've been praying, they've been preparing, they've
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.340]   been going out in the streets.
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:26.740]   As much as we have been preparing to share the gospel, and Easter is coming up, and timing,
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:31.800]   humanly speaking, may be really bad because Easter typically is the most attended Sunday
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.540]   service and the gospel is being preached.
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:37.300]   Many people come to Christ as a result of all of this.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:44.260]   But know that as much as we have been preparing to bring the gospel to the world, God has
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:49.420]   been preparing behind the scene from the moment Adam and Eve fell.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:56.220]   That even in this, God may be doing something to prepare the preaching of the gospel.
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:03.180]   We have a greater platform than we would have ever had if all we did was just gather together.
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.980]   We have a greater platform to preach the gospel.
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.780]   We have a greater platform to show the glory of God.
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:12.460]   We have a greater platform to demonstrate what agape love looks like in the context
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:17.020]   where everybody else is bunkering down in their shelters.
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:22.620]   Let us not neglect showing hospitality and doing good to those around us.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:27.820]   The broad outline of the book of Hebrews, he begins by saying in chapter one, "Jesus
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.980]   is better than the angels."
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:33.620]   And the point of that is, therefore, pay attention to him.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:37.860]   Right now we're online, and I'm online almost daily, hourly, looking at the news, making
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.460]   sure, and we're online chatting with the leaders.
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:41.460]   How do we practice this?
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:42.460]   What do we do?
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.220]   We need to communicate.
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:49.540]   But in the midst of all of this, the point of why it begins by saying, "Jesus is greater
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:55.900]   than the angels," he says, "Therefore, you must pay close attention to him."
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:38:00.500]   First and foremost, that we need to be careful that in the midst of all these information
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:05.620]   that's being disseminated through all these social medias, are we founded in the word
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.040]   of God first?
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.420]   Is the paradigm in which we look at the world and how we make decisions, is that what we
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:14.940]   have founded upon the gospel that you and I profess?
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:19.700]   So first and foremost, are we paying attention to Christ before we pay attention to the media
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.860]   and whatever it is that we're paying attention to?
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:26.120]   So that whatever we do in response to the information that we're getting, we're founded
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:30.580]   upon the paradigm that is created by Christ.
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:34.100]   Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so
[00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:39.420]   that you may be able to test the perfect will of God.
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:43.260]   Use the word of God first and foremost before anything else.
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:47.300]   Second of all, chapter three, "Jesus is greater than Moses."
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:48.940]   Moses was the greatest leader.
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:54.300]   In times like this, our natural instinct is to look to leaders for guidance.
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.300]   What is President Trump saying?
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.380]   What is the governor saying?
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:00.460]   In fact, what is the church leader saying?
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:05.320]   And we have been bombarded with emails and texts and social medias.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.940]   What are we doing?
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.020]   What's happening?
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:12.340]   And it's understandable because our natural instinct is to look to leadership.
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:19.220]   Moses was their greatest leader, but he reminds them, as great as Moses was, he was just a
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.220]   servant.
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.180]   Jesus was the son.
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.660]   And the point of all of this is, if you're going to look for any leader, don't look for
[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.960]   a higher hand.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:31.140]   Because higher hand, when the wolves come, they pack up and they leave because they have
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.500]   to protect themselves.
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:38.700]   But the good shepherd, Christ Jesus, he lays down his life for his sheep.
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:43.060]   So if there's anybody that we're going to look to, we're going to look to Christ first.
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.300]   That he's in our boat.
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.180]   He's the one who's in charge.
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:50.620]   And the moment that we forget that is when panic happens, when the chairs get knocked
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:52.340]   over.
[00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:57.540]   Thirdly, chapter four, "He is greater than Joshua."
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:03.860]   Chapter four leads us into Joshua because Joshua's the one who led them into rest.
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:06.460]   The true rest is found in Christ.
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:09.860]   If Joshua was able to lead them into rest, that would have been it.
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:14.940]   But he says, "No, all of that was pointing to the true rest that Jesus comes, that Jesus
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.020]   is going to take us into."
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:20.500]   And he says, "So therefore, let us fear that we do not enter this, that we fall short of
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.500]   entering this rest."
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:26.420]   In other words, look to Christ as our rest.
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:30.580]   Our comfort is not found in maybe some of you guys were diligent and went to the market
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:34.660]   way ahead of time and you have plenty of toilet paper, plenty of Purell.
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:38.140]   You got enough food if Armageddon happens, right?
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:40.140]   That is not our rest.
[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:43.560]   We're not waiting for President Trump to say, "Everything is good."
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.620]   If he says it's good, is it good?
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.140]   If our local leaders say, "You know what?
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:49.140]   There's no danger.
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:54.780]   Now go out, live like the way that everybody else is living."
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:55.780]   Is it good?
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:41:00.020]   Where do we truly find our rest?
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:01.020]   Christ is our rest.
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:03.980]   "Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden."
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:04.980]   Are you burdened?
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:06.380]   Are you scared?
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.660]   Are you looking for leadership?
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.940]   Are you looking for guidance?
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:15.020]   "Come to me," he says, "all you who are weary and heavy laden."
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:19.220]   And he says, "I will give you rest.
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.300]   My peace I give unto you."
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:25.300]   And this is a peace that the world does not know.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.740]   Is this the peace that we have in Christ?
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:33.180]   And then finally, chapter 5 through 7, the true mediator, that's where Melchizedek comes
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.180]   in.
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:37.860]   And we started in chapter 5, and then he takes a break in chapter 6, says, "He's our true
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:42.300]   mediator, but if Christ is not your mediator and you begin to drift away to the world,
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:46.580]   there is no other salvation."
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:50.420]   And he reminds us that, how important this is, and then he moves on to chapter 7, which
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:53.660]   we will be jumping into at some point.
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:54.740]   That's a broad outline.
[00:41:54.740 --> 00:42:00.820]   And then chapter 8, 9, and 10 leads us into the covenant, the new covenant versus the
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:01.820]   old covenant.
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:06.520]   And then he leads us to chapter 11, that this is the examples of these men who had genuine
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:11.060]   faith in God, and this is what their life looked like, which leads us to chapter 12
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:12.060]   and 13.
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:17.920]   "Therefore, fix your eyes upon Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith."
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:23.540]   And the greatest application of that, chapter 13, is this agape love.
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:29.300]   But the point of all of this is not simply to get our minds to think about Jesus, because
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.460]   that's just a beginning point.
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:34.580]   The reason why we need to think about Jesus is so that thinking about Jesus, that we would
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.380]   apply what it means to be anchored in Christ.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.380]   And that's exactly...
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:43.580]   There is more "let us" statements in the book of Hebrews than any other book, because the
[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:46.500]   point of this isn't simply Christology.
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:52.060]   That if you know who Jesus is compared to angels and Moses and the prophets and Melchizedek,
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:55.820]   and you got that all down, but that's where it ends, you missed the whole point, because
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.500]   the whole point of the book of Hebrews is, "Therefore."
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:02.740]   If you know who that Jesus is, our anchor, if you know that Jesus is our hope, he's our
[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:09.340]   peace, he's our leader, he's the one that we need to pay attention to, then let us,
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:10.340]   "Therefore."
[00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:13.660]   So, I want to highlight a few of these as I wrap up.
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:19.380]   In chapter 4, verse 1, "Therefore, let us fear while promise remains of entering his
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.420]   rest."
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:24.460]   The first thing that he tells us, the beginning of wisdom.
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:27.620]   Right now, we are all praying for wisdom.
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:28.860]   The world is praying for...
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.940]   Even non-Christians are praying and hoping for wisdom.
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:32.940]   What should we do?
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:34.660]   When should we shut down?
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:36.280]   When should we open?
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.280]   What is okay to do?
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.280]   What is not okay to do?
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.340]   Everybody is seeking wisdom.
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:42.340]   The Bible says the beginning of wisdom is what?
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:44.840]   Fear of the Lord.
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:51.020]   And so, we want to be prayerful as leadership, that whatever decision is being made, that
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:54.860]   it is first founded upon our reverence for him.
[00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.680]   That we are anchored in Christ.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.740]   And we're asking the church to do the same.
[00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:03.900]   Whether you are having worship at home, whether you are having worship here, wherever you
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:09.300]   are, our first and foremost is to check our own hearts.
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:12.320]   Is the fear of the Lord driving us?
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:17.100]   In Matthew 10, 28-31, "Do not fear those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.100]   soul.
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:22.860]   But rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:26.500]   Are not two sparrows sold for a cent, and yet not one of them will fall to the ground
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:27.940]   apart from your father?
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:31.260]   But the very hairs of your head are all numbered."
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.440]   Let me stop right there.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.860]   He says to fear the Lord.
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:40.660]   But the reason why we ought to fear the Lord is because he loves us.
[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:45.100]   The reason why that needs to be the foundation upon which we stand is because all other men
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:47.740]   are fleeing for safety.
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:49.820]   Just like we are.
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:56.860]   But the only one who can actually protect us, the only one who knows what's coming tomorrow,
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:01.220]   the only one who knows where it's going, only God knows.
[00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:06.100]   And that sovereign God that we fear, he counts every hair on our head.
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:07.580]   So do you not fear?
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:11.660]   You are more valuable than the sparrows.
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:17.260]   And that's why we need to, especially at this time, ask ourselves, is the fear of the Lord
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:21.420]   in which I stand today?
[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.060]   Or is it the fear of this virus?
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:28.020]   Our greatest fear should not be catching this virus.
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:32.440]   Our greatest fear is if we catch this virus, that am I going to die?
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:37.580]   That shouldn't be our greatest fear, even though it's our natural human response.
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:40.860]   Our greatest fear is to be separated from God.
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:46.220]   Our greatest fear is that our loved ones would pass without knowing him.
[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:48.460]   Our greatest fear is not death.
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:54.900]   Because ultimately death is a release from this broken body, that we may be with the
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:55.900]   Lord.
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:58.760]   To be absent in the flesh is to be with the Lord.
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:03.220]   Is the fear of the Lord foundation upon which we are doing and making all decisions?
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:07.380]   Hebrews chapter 4, 14, "Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:12.300]   the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession."
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:17.860]   Let us not passively allow this to happen and just kind of hunker down until this passes
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:19.060]   over.
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.540]   Let us hold fast.
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:26.940]   Let us practice our faith in confidence and in courage.
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:30.400]   This is a great opportunity to magnify Christ.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:36.140]   My prayer is that revival will break out because of this, because of the way the Christians
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:38.420]   are responding to this.
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:42.940]   Hebrews 10, 24, "And let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:44.380]   deeds."
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:48.540]   To consider carefully, to think and calculate.
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.720]   A couple weeks ago we talked about that.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:54.380]   We talked about this text, to consider how to provoke one another.
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:59.380]   You know, a couple weeks ago this was around, but now I think that our emotional state is
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:03.140]   a lot more fertile to receive this word.
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.740]   This agape love.
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:12.180]   Consider carefully not just your family, not just are you safe, but the people around
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:17.860]   us, especially the elderly who are confused.
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:22.500]   Maybe next time you go to the supermarket, watch for people who couldn't get what they
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:23.500]   needed to get.
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.740]   Do you have too many?
[00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:29.680]   Maybe you have neighbors who are not connected to the internet.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.580]   Maybe there's an elderly person.
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:35.720]   Maybe there's an elderly home filled with dozens.
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:41.420]   Maybe possibly hundreds of elderly who do not have the ability to run to the supermarket
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:44.540]   and go get food if they wanted to.
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:49.860]   To consider carefully how to stimulate, provoke one another on toward loving good deeds, not
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:53.680]   forsaking our own assembly together as is a habit of some.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.980]   Remember the context.
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:48:00.980]   Again, this is not the same context because we're not under persecution.
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.260]   There's no sin in going online.
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:04.260]   We're doing everything.
[00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:08.700]   In fact, many are doing this so that it doesn't spread faster than it needs to.
[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:15.140]   So, it's not the exact same situation, but the principle behind it is to place a high
[00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:18.300]   value on the gathering of believers.
[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:23.660]   When it is time, when it is the wisest thing to do, we will make that decision.
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:28.060]   But we don't want to knock over the chairs in that process.
[00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.540]   We don't want to panic.
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:34.380]   We want to respond to what's going on, and we want to make sure that whether we are out
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:38.540]   or whether we are home, we are responding and not reacting.
[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:42.740]   But meanwhile, let's be careful.
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:50.660]   Let's be careful to realize that what we have been given.
[00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:53.900]   We've been praying for people to come to Christ.
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.940]   The ground is more fertile now.
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:00.260]   We're praying for opportunities to share the gospel.
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:02.460]   People are more open now.
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:06.100]   We're praying for opportunities to show agape love.
[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:09.260]   More opportunities have been created now.
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:15.580]   Let's stay sober and redeem the opportunity that God has given us and not react like the
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:16.580]   rest of the world.
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:21.180]   Hebrews 12, "Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:26.780]   also lay aside every encumbrance and sin which so easily entangles."
[00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:31.420]   There are certain things that we have to put down, our temporary Bible study going online,
[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:35.380]   meeting together, fellowship, the gospel night, all of this at some point will be picked back
[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:38.220]   up when this passes.
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:42.500]   But there are also things that we cannot do right now that maybe we should put down and
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:44.580]   not pick up.
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:46.100]   What are some of these encumbrances?
[00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:50.220]   So when these things happen, it forces us to examine what we value, what is important,
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.920]   what is not important.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:57.240]   Anything that is not essential has been shut down.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:00.400]   Some of these things probably should not be picked up.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:04.760]   What are these things that we need to carefully consider?
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:10.600]   Verse 13, chapter 13, verse 3, "So let us go out to him outside the camp bearing his
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:11.600]   reproach."
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:16.760]   Since Jesus was crucified outside the camp, meaning that's where anybody who was shunned
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:21.320]   by the society, that they will be taken outside the camp to be stoned.
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:23.520]   If you were a leper, you were sent outside the camp.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:28.120]   So when he says, "Let us go outside the camp with Christ," he means, "Let's leave behind
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.080]   the comforts of this world.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:36.760]   Let's leave behind wanting to be accepted.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.720]   Follow Christ outside the camp."
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:42.880]   That we are aliens and strangers just passing through.
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:48.360]   That maybe this virus is a reminder to us that all who are united with Christ is united
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:52.080]   with Christ already outside the camp.
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:56.760]   So maybe this is a good opportunity for us to reflect and examine our lives and to join
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.840]   him willfully outside.
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:04.680]   And then finally, chapter 13, verse 15, "Through him then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:07.600]   of praise to God."
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:11.000]   Remember the context that this is written.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   People are afraid of death.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.320]   Some of them may have seen their friends crucified.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:22.720]   Maybe their brother, their child, their mother, their uncle, grandparents.
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:27.400]   They may have already seen them in the Colosseum being torn apart by wild animals.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:29.680]   He's talking to that group.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:34.280]   He's talking to people who may have even smelled the flesh of their own loved ones burning
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:38.000]   because of the cruelty of Nero.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.880]   That's who he's speaking to.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:44.820]   In the midst of that, "Through him then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.120]   to God."
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:53.300]   Because even in that, God is on his throne.
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:58.360]   There is a kind of worship that we give to God in time of peace, and even then it is
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:59.960]   sweet.
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.840]   Even then it is necessary.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:06.840]   But sometimes there are circumstances in our lives, whether it is private or whether it
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:13.560]   is public, whether it is small or whether it is large, there are certain periods of
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:20.320]   our life where the worship of our Savior becomes that much sweeter.
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:29.640]   Our greatest witness to the world is to declare the glory of God in the midst of this darkness,
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:35.400]   because the light shines much brighter when the world does not see light.
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:41.760]   So let us not neglect the opportunity that God has given us and be anchored in Christ.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:49.760]   So just as an, again, just we're asking you that things are rapidly changing, and the
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:56.400]   Orange County Health Offices are telling us that at least as of now it is still low, and
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:59.320]   that may change overnight, you know, with more testing that are coming.
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:03.640]   So we are not being naive, and we are being pressed on both sides.
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:09.280]   We have, "Don't ever close your door," and those people are slowly dissipating, and then
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:13.720]   more and more of, "We should have closed it three months ago," you know, and we are under
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:19.120]   tremendous pressure, and the easiest thing that we could do is just shut it, you know,
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:24.440]   and go online, which we may end up doing even as early as this week.
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:30.560]   We want to make sure that whatever we do, that we are not reacting, that we are responding,
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:37.160]   and we are responding carefully, wisely, prayerfully, firmly anchored in Christ.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:40.080]   So that is our request for you, to do the same.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:46.840]   Watch, listen, pray, and I hope that the message this morning, a reminder of the overview of
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:51.520]   the book of Hebrews, will serve as a foundation upon everything that we do going forward.
[00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:54.520]   Let me pray for us, and then I'm going to ask you guys to take some time to pray, and
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:59.960]   as we said, we're not going to have an official offering time for the sake of sanitation,
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:04.080]   so that when you are done, when the service is over, if you are planning to physically
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:10.120]   bring the offering, then it will be in those two houses, okay?
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.120]   That's prepared in the front, okay?
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.520]   Then please do that after the service.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:13.360]   All right, let's pray.
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:16.340]   [ Silence ]
