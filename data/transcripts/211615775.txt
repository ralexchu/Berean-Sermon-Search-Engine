[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.560]   Alright, well it's a joy to be here again to Preaching God's Word.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:16.240]   I got a chance to meet with Pastor Peter and he told me about everything that happened.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:24.560]   All the last minute construction that you guys had to do and then, man, I felt so bad
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.560]   for him.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.520]   I told him, "Hey, I'll take you out to get some Tommy's burger."
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.840]   I don't know if you know, he likes Tommy's.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.320]   So we're going to grab some burgers and try to encourage him in that way.
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.720]   But I got a chance to hang out with Sam Cho and he told me that several of you guys came
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.340]   in the middle of the week after work and worked all the way through the night and then went
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.200]   to work again, came back, and then worked at the church.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.880]   You guys pulled several all-nighters.
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.120]   I heard about that and I was just immensely encouraged, immensely encouraged by the body
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.200]   here.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.800]   It is clear that you guys love the Lord and that you love each other.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.440]   It's more than just having a building, but the community here, that's what it's really
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.720]   about.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.160]   This is just a place where this community can meet.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.960]   I'm grateful that you guys have this and I'm sure you guys are going to use it for the
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.780]   glory of God.
[00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.240]   This is new to me.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.240]   This is crazy.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.480]   I was talking with James Hong and this is almost, this is like mega church status right
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.480]   here.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.480]   This is crazy.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.000]   And I was preaching the first service and I could kind of see myself on the periphery.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.240]   My hands are like wailing and I'm like, "Oh man, that's really annoying.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.680]   I got to stop doing that."
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.280]   But I think we'll be able to get by.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.280]   Anyways, today I was thinking about, it's really cool.
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.240]   Pastor Peter just kind of lets me preach on whatever I want to preach on.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.600]   And so I decided to preach on my hobby horse.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.920]   And if you guys have known me for a few years, you guys know my hobby horse is the resurrection.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.600]   I love the resurrection.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.960]   It impacted me and really changed the way that I have understood my salvation or at
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.520]   least deepened it.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.800]   Deepened my understanding of salvation.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.020]   And so I wanted to kind of share that with you today as well.
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.720]   So if you guys have, if I've known you for some time and you guys heard my preaching,
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.080]   this might be redundant, but may you still be blessed.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.080]   Okay.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.440]   We're going to be talking about the resurrection.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.120]   And today our passage that I selected was 1 Corinthians 15, but this is not a passage
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.360]   I'm going to be expositing, but I felt like it touched upon the subject and the importance
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.240]   of the resurrection.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.880]   And so that we can kind of like jump, jump from here and get into the theology of the
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.320]   significance of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:57.640]   So read with me 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and let's read verse 15, verse 12 to 19 once more.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.680]   Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.480]   is no resurrection of the dead, but if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.880]   Christ has been raised.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.080]   If Christ has not been raised, even then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.080]   vain.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.080]   We're even found to be misrepresenting God because we testified about God that he raised
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.080]   Christ whom he did not raise.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.920]   If it is true that the dead are not raised for if the dead are not raised, not even Christ
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.160]   has been raised.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.480]   And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.280]   Then also, then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.640]   If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.160]   Let's join me in prayer before we get into the preaching of God's word.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.560]   Dear God, we are grateful for our opportunity to get into your word to study the theology
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.560]   of the resurrection.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.040]   And I pray that as we come to dive into this truth that we will come to appreciate and
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.720]   love it just as much as we do the crucifixion, the cross of our savior.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.760]   Help me to rightfully divide the word of truth to speak clear, speak with clarity and
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.280]   I pray for the congregation that they would receive this lesson and worship you.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.920]   May it be a people who worship you for what you have done for us in the gospel.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.760]   We pray this in Jesus name, amen.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.720]   Now you got to think about the resurrection and what it is.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.040]   It is a person coming back from the dead.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.200]   It is an outrageous event.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:44.160]   And yet 2000 years ago, number of people have testified to this reality.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.600]   A man by the name of Matthew in Matthew chapter 28 verse 1 through 6.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.320]   He says, "Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.280]   and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.360]   And behold, there was a great earthquake for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.920]   and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.920]   His appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.200]   And for fear of him, the guards trembled and became like dead men.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.920]   But the angel said to the women, 'Do not be afraid for I know that you seek Jesus who
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.920]   was crucified.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.040]   He is not here for he has risen as he said.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.000]   Come see the place where he lay.'"
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.960]   Mark records the same thing and he says in Mark chapter 16 verse 6, "And he, that is
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.760]   the angel, said to them, 'Do not be alarmed.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.440]   You seek Jesus of Nazareth who was crucified.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.440]   He has risen.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.440]   He is not here.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.640]   Come see the place where they laid him.'"
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.440]   A physician by the name of Luke gives a record of two men who interacted with the resurrected
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.440]   Jesus and this is what they said when they realized that they saw the Lord.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.200]   It says in Luke chapter 24 verse 33 to 35, "And they rose that same hour and returned
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.200]   to Jerusalem.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.520]   And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together saying, 'The
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.240]   Lord has risen indeed and has appeared to Simon.'
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.480]   Then they told what had happened on the road and how he was known to them in the breaking
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.720]   of the bread."
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.160]   Jesus also appeared to his disciple John and in John chapter 20 verse 24 to 28 it says,
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.120]   "Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the twin, was not with them when Jesus came.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.720]   So the other disciples told him, 'We have seen the Lord.'
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.120]   But he said to them, 'Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails and place my finger
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:24.480]   into the mark of the nails and place my hand into his side, I will never believe.'
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.520]   Eight days later his disciples were inside again and Thomas was with them.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.040]   And although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, 'Peace
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.040]   be with you.'
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.320]   Then he said to Thomas, 'Put your finger here and see my hands and put out your hand
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.320]   and place it in my side.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.440]   Do not disbelieve, but believe.'
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.320]   Thomas answered, 'My Lord and my God.'"
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.280]   And then there's another man by the name of Josephus, a first century Jewish historian.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.080]   He gives a record of the resurrection as well.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.360]   He says, "Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.280]   man for he was a doer of wonderful works.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.080]   A teacher of such men as received the truth with pleasure.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.320]   He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.920]   He was the Christ.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.800]   And when Pilate at the suggestion of principal men amongst them had condemned him to the
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.000]   cross, those that loved him at first did not forsake him for he appeared to them alive
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.640]   again the third day.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.560]   As the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:29.480]   him and the tribe of Christians so named from him are not extinct at this day."
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.680]   Josephus spoke those words.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.480]   After being crucified upon the cross, Jesus Christ was buried in the tomb.
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.320]   Three days later he resurrected from the dead.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.920]   The message, the event was so radical, it was so staggering that people could not stop
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.520]   talking about this man who came back from the dead.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.200]   In the Roman historian Suetonius, he says this.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.920]   He says the Jews, he that is Emperor Claudius, the Jews he expelled from Rome.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.920]   Why?
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:02.280]   Since they were constantly in rebellion at the instigation of Christus.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.920]   Everybody was talking about Christus.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:10.440]   Everybody was talking about this man who clearly died upon the cross and then resurrected from
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.440]   the dead.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.200]   Even those who weren't immediate followers of Jesus Christ.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.880]   It could not be pushed away as some kind of human fabrication because more than a few
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.400]   people were claiming that they saw Jesus alive.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:26.960]   It was hundreds, normal, sound thinking people saying that I saw Jesus.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.960]   He died and he's alive.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.680]   Simple message because it actually happened.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.640]   And it wasn't just a sheer number of people that factored into the authentication of this
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.260]   gospel message.
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.440]   These Christians were putting their life on the line.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.560]   You don't lay down your life for a lie.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.520]   You lay down your life for the truth.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:50.560]   Now the question, the question that we must ask ourselves is this.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.360]   What does the resurrection do?
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.920]   You guys ever think about that?
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.240]   What does it do?
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:04.520]   My problem for many years as I began to study this, take my faith more seriously and through
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:09.180]   my years in seminary and my year, the beginning years of my ministry, my pastoral ministry
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.640]   was this exact question.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.160]   What does the resurrection do?
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.600]   I knew biblically it was necessary.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.000]   We read 1 Corinthians chapter 15.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   It's necessary.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.920]   If Christ did not resurrect from the dead, we are still in our sins.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.000]   We are still in our sins.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.440]   We would be damned if Christ did not resurrect from the dead.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.400]   I knew biblically it was necessary, but logically I didn't know how it fit into the scheme of
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.400]   my salvation.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.580]   How did it work?
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.000]   What did it actually do?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.860]   If you're a Christian, you believe in what we call substitutionary atonement or double
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:38.860]   imputation.
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:43.380]   I'm sure you guys have been taught this at your church or here at Berean.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.340]   If you're a Christian, if you don't know the terms, you at least believe in it.
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.280]   What it says is that we are all sinners.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.580]   Because we have sinned against God, we deserve to be damned.
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.700]   The wages of sin is death, Romans chapter 6 verse 23.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:01.620]   But Jesus Christ, what he did was he took our sins upon himself and then he ended up
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.680]   dying the death that we deserve to die.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.680]   What did he do instead?
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.140]   He took his righteousness, imputed it to us.
[00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.500]   He gave us his righteousness so that by his righteousness we live.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.980]   So I thought about this and I was thinking, okay, my sins are given to Jesus.
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.360]   Jesus' righteousness is given to me.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.020]   He dies because of my sins.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.540]   I live because of his righteousness.
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.140]   It's like, good deal, right?
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.140]   Good deal for me.
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.580]   Not for him, but for me it's a good deal.
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.820]   My sins are imputed to Christ.
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:30.820]   He dies.
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.060]   His righteousness is imputed to me.
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.060]   I live.
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.920]   And I think, why the resurrection?
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.600]   It doesn't seem like his crucifixion is sufficient.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.400]   It seems like Calvary is enough for the security of our redemption.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.120]   So why did Christ have to resurrect from the dead?
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:53.960]   Now I've heard people say, well Jesus Christ resurrected from the dead as proof.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.760]   Proof that the work of Calvary was sufficient.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.680]   It was proof that it was enough to save us.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.960]   And when I heard that I just kind of squirmed a little bit.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.240]   Because what's the implication if the resurrection is simply a proof?
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.760]   If it's a proof, then it's not necessary.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.900]   Right?
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:17.960]   If it's just proving the necessity of the cross and it's just showing the sufficiency
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:23.620]   of the cross for the security of our salvation, then the resurrection is not necessary.
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.840]   God might as well have just opened up the heavens and said, hey look, the cross, it's
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.840]   done.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.840]   It is finished.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.840]   It is enough.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.240]   But that's not what we find in scripture.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:38.280]   When we read the Bible, we not only read about the death of Christ, but we also read about
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.280]   the resurrection of Christ.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.600]   When we read about the gospel proclamation, we not only read about the death of Christ,
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.680]   but we read about the resurrection of Christ.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:53.320]   Peter says in Acts chapter 2, 32, this Jesus God raised up and of that we all are witnesses.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.960]   Acts chapter 4, 10, it says, "Let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:02.120]   that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.120]   dead."
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:08.040]   Acts chapter 13, verse 34, "And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.960]   more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way, I will give you the holy and
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.160]   sure blessings of David."
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:19.200]   First Peter chapter 1, 21, "Who through him are all our believers in God, who raised him
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.000]   from the dead and gave him glory."
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.040]   Raised him from the dead.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:29.000]   It is the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ that is necessary for our salvation.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Why?
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Because the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ are essential components of the
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.080]   gospel of Jesus Christ and the gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God for the salvation
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.080]   of men.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.120]   And that's why the apostle Paul says in 1 Corinthians chapter 15, verse 17, "And if
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:47.000]   Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins."
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:55.280]   Romans 4, 25, it says this, "Who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification."
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.880]   Yeah he died for our justification but the text says here he was raised for our justification.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:05.600]   And so we come back to the question, what does it do?
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.440]   What does the resurrection do?
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.320]   I took my seminary training, right?
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.960]   I looked through my commentaries, looked through my systematic theologies, looked through the
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:20.320]   books that I had, went through the library trying to find the answer, what does the resurrection
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.920]   do?
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:26.800]   And dude, I could not find a satisfactory answer.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.160]   It was really hard.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.760]   I knew it was necessary.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.280]   I knew it was important.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.560]   But what did it actually do?
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:39.120]   And the systematic theology books that I came across, the commentaries did not help at least
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.040]   to the extent that I wanted it to help.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:50.280]   And I came across this little book by Richard Gaffin and he said this because he came across
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.280]   the same problem.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:57.320]   He says, "Charles Hodge's systematic theology devotes four pages to the resurrection in
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:02.040]   contrast to the lengthy treatment of atonement, approximately 35 pages.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.040]   W.G.T.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:09.000]   Shedd dogmatic theology passes directly from a discussion of vicarious atonement to regeneration.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.200]   The major writings of B.B. Warfield in this area concentrate exclusively upon the death
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.640]   of Christ understood as atonement.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:20.440]   The approach of Lewis Burkhoff's systematic theology is similar to that of Hodge.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.200]   After a brief discussion of the resurrection, like four pages, he moves on to a lengthy
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.440]   treatment of atonement, approximately 40 pages.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:34.360]   The approaches of Abraham Cooper, Didactem dogmatic locus de Christo par secunda, and
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.760]   Hermann Bavink, Gerform Merdedammaty provides no significant exception to this general pattern."
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:45.480]   I never know how to pronounce those German words.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.080]   But he gets the point across.
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.640]   Nobody's talking about the resurrection.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:56.280]   And even in our day and age, we don't hear much about the resurrection.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.400]   We hear a lot of things about the cross.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.680]   You have books like The Cross and Salvation, Cross Center Life, Preaching the Cross, The
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.320]   Cross of Christ, Proclaiming Cross Center Theology, and so on and so forth.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:12.280]   All these books about the cross, all these books about Calvary, but hardly any books
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.640]   on the resurrection.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.400]   And so today, what we're going to do is answer the question, "What does the resurrection
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.400]   do?"
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.400]   Good?
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   I think it's good.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.400]   Okay.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.400]   That's my introduction.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.800]   What does the resurrection do?
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.760]   We're going to answer that question.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.920]   And I hope this blew my mind.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.480]   It blew my mind away.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:39.680]   And I hope it not only blows your mind away, but it instills a heart of worship towards
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.680]   your God.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.120]   We worship God for the cross.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.900]   Why do we worship God for the cross?
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.920]   Because we understand the profundity of it.
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:51.040]   And so I want you guys to know the profundity of the resurrection so that we might grow
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.520]   in our worship towards God.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:56.360]   And that's my hope for this church.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.760]   So turn with me to Romans chapter 6.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.480]   Let's answer this question.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:15.200]   Romans chapter 6, verse 1 through 10.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:22.320]   Romans chapter 6, verse 1 through 10.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.320]   What shall we say then?
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.080]   Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.880]   By no means, how can we who died to sin still live in it?
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.440]   Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were also baptized
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.440]   into his death?
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.840]   We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death in order that just as Christ was
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.960]   raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in the newness of life.
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.200]   But we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.080]   him in a resurrection like his.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.840]   We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.360]   brought to nothing so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.960]   For one who has died has been set free from sin.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.640]   Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.080]   We know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.000]   Death no longer has dominion over him.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.800]   For death he died, he died to sin.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:12.120]   Once for all, but the life he lives, he lives to God.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:18.720]   Now in order to understand this passage and the significance of the resurrection, it is
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.540]   necessary for us to understand our problem.
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:28.440]   We can't understand how God saves us unless we first understand what he saves us from.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.440]   That make sense?
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.480]   We can't understand how he saves us unless we know what he saves us from.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:41.360]   If I were to ask you, what is the fundamental problem of man, what would you say?
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.240]   This is not rhetorical, this is more interactive.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.240]   I do this once in a while with our church.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:53.320]   So if I say what is the fundamental problem, immediately what do you think?
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.320]   Sin.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.320]   Immediately sin.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.320]   Good.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.320]   I've been taught well.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.880]   Otherwise I'd tell Pastor Peter.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:08.680]   So sin, but what's more fundamental than sin?
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:18.480]   What is the fundamental problem of the individual man besides sin?
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.920]   Fundamental.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.920]   Speak to me.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.240]   Remember Dr. Montoya, the Mexican professor?
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.240]   Speak to me.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.240]   He always goes like this.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.240]   Speak to me.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.760]   So speak to me.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:34.320]   What is the fundamental problem of man?
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.240]   Broken relationship with God.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:42.440]   I would say that results from the sin and the problem that I'm thinking about.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:47.760]   But yes, that is an issue that does get resolved through the gospel.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.760]   Let me phrase it like this.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:54.560]   What is, what leads us to sin?
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.440]   Pride.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.000]   Pride is a form of sin.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   It's ugly.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:07.720]   Yes, it's an ugly, nasty sin, but I would say fundamental.
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:13.720]   Disobedience, I would say is a way of describing sin.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.960]   So this is really good because now we're trying to think very precisely of the realm of this
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.360]   category of transgression and sin and just what's messed up with us.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.000]   We're studying how messed up we are.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.040]   Ooh, good.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.440]   That's it.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.080]   Inherited sin nature.
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.160]   The problem is not only with what we have done.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.160]   The problem is with who we are.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.880]   It's a twofold problem.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.320]   It's a twofold problem.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.480]   You have to understand the problem before we can understand the solution.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.080]   The problem is not only with what we have done, but it is with who we are.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.040]   The problem is not only with the fact that we sin.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.240]   The problem is that we are sinners.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.240]   That's the problem.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:06.480]   Have you guys watched that YouTube clip with John Piper where they get a clip of his sermon
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.000]   and they play the soundtrack of Michael Jackson's "Bad"?
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.560]   You guys have got to look it up.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.560]   It's excellent.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:18.520]   But it's great because there's a clip from John Piper's sermon and he says something
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.520]   like this.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.520]   He's really passionate and dramatic.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.640]   He goes, "I don't just do bad things.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.920]   I am bad."
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.040]   John Piper is bad.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.880]   You know I'm bad and you are bad as well.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.880]   He says something like that.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.520]   And then when he says, "I am bad," the Michael Jackson soundtrack comes on.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.520]   He goes, "Bad."
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.520]   He's posing like this.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.520]   It's great.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:54.680]   It's so profound.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.520]   I don't just do bad things.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.360]   I am bad.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.560]   I don't just do bad things.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.640]   I am bad.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.840]   We don't just sin, but we are also sinners.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:13.360]   The problem is not only with what we do, but the problem is with who we are.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.840]   And so Colossians chapter 2 verse 13, listen to this.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.520]   "And you who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh."
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.520]   Deadness is a state of being.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.520]   That's your problem.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.520]   You are dead.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:29.520]   And then it says in Ephesians chapter 2 verse 3, "We were by nature children of wrath like
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.600]   the rest of mankind."
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.600]   Listen to Romans chapter 8.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.880]   Flip a few chapters to Romans 8.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.880]   Read this with me.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:44.920]   Romans chapter 8, verse 5 through 8.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:49.760]   "For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.800]   But those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.440]   For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.440]   and peace.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.360]   For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.160]   For it does not submit to God's law.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.520]   Indeed, it cannot.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.760]   Those who are in the flesh cannot please God."
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:13.360]   The problem of man is fundamentally lies at the core of who he is.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.220]   We're not sinners because we sin.
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.220]   It's the other way around.
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.560]   We sin because we are sinners.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.960]   It's because we're fornicators that we desecrate the marriage bed.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.960]   It's because we are drunkards that we get drunk.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.000]   Because we're materialists that we can worship money.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.700]   And that's offensive, isn't it?
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.120]   You are a sinner.
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.120]   You are a transgressor.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.520]   And because you are a transgressor, because you are a sinner, you sin.
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.480]   The Bible goes even further to offend our senses.
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.920]   It says, "Because you have sinned and because you are a sinner, you deserve to be damned
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.080]   for your transgressions."
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.120]   You deserve to be damned for who you are.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.640]   It's because of who you are, a spiritually dead man, a man who by nature is a child of
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.720]   wrath, a man who is in the flesh, that you transgress the commands of God.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:02.320]   And because you transgress the laws of God, you deserve to be judged to hell.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:07.920]   Now if you understand that, that's why you understand the cross is so beautiful.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.920]   The Lord Jesus Christ took upon himself our sins.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:17.920]   He took upon himself our transgressions, our lust, our bitterness, our anger, our gossip,
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:18.920]   our slander.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:23.120]   He took upon himself our shame, our perverse thoughts, our black hearts.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:28.080]   He's taken everything upon himself and he died the death that we were supposed to die.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.280]   The Father looked upon his Son and he saw the sins of the world upon him and he crushed
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.480]   his Son because righteousness cannot stand before sin.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:41.880]   And Christ became sin on our behalf because of his love for you, because of the Father's
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.880]   love for you.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.640]   That's why we love the cross.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.640]   That's why I love the cross.
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.640]   That's why you love the cross.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.840]   But there's a question that remains.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:51.840]   What about me?
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.240]   God, you took care of my sins.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.400]   You took care of my sins upon the cross.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.680]   You took care of my sins at Calvary.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.560]   But what about who I am?
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.160]   The fundamental problem still remains.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.160]   I'm still a man in the flesh.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.400]   I'm still a man who has a mind that is hostile towards God.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.920]   I'm still a man who hates the law of God.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.280]   I'm a man who cannot submit to the law of God.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.960]   I'm still a rebellious murderer.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.320]   I'm still a lustful adulterer.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.840]   I'm still a covetous thief.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.840]   So what about me?
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.040]   The question that should resound within the Christian is, yes, Lord, you took care of
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.500]   my sins upon the cross, but what about who I am?
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.900]   What about this flesh?
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.200]   What about this nature?
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.200]   What about my soul?
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.200]   It's still corrupt.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.200]   It's still depraved.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.520]   It's still dead.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.640]   And God gives a shocking commandment.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.080]   You want to take care of the problem of who you are?
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.720]   Listen to my voice.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.720]   Kill it.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.400]   If your hand causes you to sin, what do you do?
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.400]   You chop it off.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.400]   If your eye causes you to sin, what do you do?
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.280]   You rip it out.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.880]   If your life is found to be corrupt, what do you do?
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.240]   You put it to an end.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.720]   Now you guys should be thinking, your head should be spinning.
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.720]   I can't put myself to death.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:05.980]   If I go back to the grave, I'm not coming back up.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:06.980]   Nobody dies.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.120]   No human being can die and come back.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.720]   But the Lord says there is one.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.840]   There is one.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.840]   A man by the name of Jesus.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.220]   He went to Calvary and he was crucified.
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.760]   He went to Golgotha, gave up his soul.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.320]   He went up that hill to die.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.040]   And three days later he resurrected from the dead.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.080]   Death could not hold him down.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.520]   Death could not seal his condemnation.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.360]   But he was condemned before he died.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.680]   First Corinthians 15 verse 55, "O death, where is your victory?
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.120]   O death, where is your sting?
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.840]   In the life of Christ, where is it?"
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:46.400]   So the answer to the problem of dying lies in Christ.
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:51.400]   The secret to the answer, the solution, is in Him.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.480]   The Canadian scientist G.B. Hardy, he said this, "When I look at religion, I have two
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.480]   questions.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.120]   One, has anybody ever conquered death?
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.800]   And two, if they have, did they make a way for me to conquer death?
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.480]   I checked the tomb of Buddha and it was occupied.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.640]   I checked the tomb of Confucius and it was occupied.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.760]   I checked the tomb of Muhammad and it was occupied.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.960]   I came to the tomb of Jesus and it was empty.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.080]   I said, there is one who conquered death.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.400]   I asked the second question, did he make a way for me to do it?
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:24.720]   And I opened the Bible and discovered that he said, because I live, ye shall live also."
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.360]   There is one who died and resurrected from the dead.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.560]   And he made a way for us to experience the same thing.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.840]   So God looks upon your fallen and corrupt body.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:39.960]   He looks upon you in the flesh and he tells you to do and fulfill the most radical command
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.440]   of commitment loyalty, die.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:49.960]   But then he says this, trust that I will raise it back up from the dead.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:55.160]   He who gave us life when we were born will give us life again.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:59.040]   Matthew chapter 16 verse 24 to 25 says, "Then Jesus told his disciples, if anyone would
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.000]   come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.220]   For whoever would save his life will lose it.
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:10.520]   But whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.920]   So the answer is in Jesus.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:19.120]   But the question still remains, how does it work?
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.880]   How does it work?
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:26.800]   You've given me the solution, but tell me and show me how you arrive to that answer.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:41.120]   Romans chapter 6, let's go back to Romans chapter 6 verse 3 to 4.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:45.920]   Romans chapter 6 verse 3 to 4.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:50.520]   Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.800]   his death?
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:56.720]   We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death in order that just as Christ was
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.640]   raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in the newness of life.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:07.120]   What Paul is talking about here is the efficacious power of spirit baptism.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.440]   The efficacious power of spirit baptism.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.680]   First Corinthians 12, 13.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:16.880]   Now these verses I'm giving you are, if you're taking notes, write it down.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.360]   They're gold.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.120]   These are gold verses.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.320]   First Corinthians 12, 13.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:28.200]   It says, "For in one spirit we were all baptized into one body."
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:33.640]   So that term, "for in one spirit," that can be translated as "for with one spirit."
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.880]   For with one spirit we were all baptized into one body.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:41.640]   In the same way John baptized with water, so the Lord Jesus Christ baptizes with the
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.640]   Holy Spirit.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:48.680]   We're all baptized and the result of that baptism is unity in the body of Christ.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.840]   You get a similar teaching in Galatians 3, verse 27, which says, "For as many of you
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.400]   as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ."
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.160]   Have put on Christ.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:03.080]   This is how it works.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:08.320]   I use hand motions and my congregation makes fun of me because it seems childish, but I
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.320]   think it works really well.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.320]   This is Jesus.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:17.320]   So children, if you're listening, this is for you as well.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.320]   This is Jesus.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.320]   This is you.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:25.160]   The Bible talks about, in First Corinthians 12, 13 and Galatians 3, 27, the moment we
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:30.800]   believe we were baptized with the Holy Spirit, but we were baptized into Christ.
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.800]   We put on Christ.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   You see that?
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.160]   So the result of spirit baptism is unity with Christ.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.640]   Now this is important.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:43.760]   Unity is critical because if we're united to Jesus Christ, whatever happens to Jesus
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.200]   happens to us.
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.720]   Whatever happens to Jesus happens to us.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:52.000]   So if Christ died, that means we in union with Christ have what?
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.240]   We die.
[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:58.680]   If Christ resurrected from the dead, then we in union with him have been resurrected
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.160]   from the dead.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.080]   This idea, this life that we have in union with Christ, that is what we call new life.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.060]   That's what we call resurrected life.
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:08.900]   That's what we call regenerated life.
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.360]   That's what we call a life with a circumcised heart, a life with a renewed mind.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.200]   That's the life that is born again.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.320]   When we use these terms, there's a specific truth that the apostles and the writers are
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.320]   trying to convey.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.740]   Regeneration, justification, sanctification, glorification, they're all terms that we kind
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.040]   of lump up together.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:29.440]   But the Bible is teaching that this reality that we have in union with Jesus Christ, that
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.160]   life is the regenerated life.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.460]   That is the life with the circumcised heart, with the renewed mind.
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:40.220]   That is the life that is born again.
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:45.100]   So the reason, how it works is through baptism, we're united with Christ, a unity, where we
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.040]   die with him and resurrect with him.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.040]   You got that?
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.040]   Okay, good.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.040]   I hope you worship God.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:56.580]   Let's look at Romans 6, 5 through 7.
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:02.640]   "For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:04.440]   with him in a resurrection like his."
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.840]   You see the language coming out.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.600]   "We know that our old self was," what?
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.600]   "Crucified."
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.600]   Our old self was killed.
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:18.800]   "With him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing so that we would no
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:23.160]   longer be enslaved to sin for one who has died has been set free from sin."
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.320]   How do you mortify the body?
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.600]   How do you mortify this heart of lust?
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.360]   How do you mortify this heart of bitterness and anger and greed?
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:34.280]   You mortify it by uniting it with the Lord Jesus Christ and crucifying it upon the cross.
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:38.720]   That's why the apostle Paul says in Galatians chapter 220, "I've been crucified with Christ."
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.080]   I no longer live.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.240]   He's saying I'm a dead man.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.240]   He's emphatic about that.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.240]   I'm a dead man.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.240]   The ego is gone.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:48.280]   I myself am no longer alive.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:53.400]   So because I am dead, the powers that once ruled over me, the powers of sin, the powers,
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:57.700]   the spiritual forces of darkness, the angelic, demonic powers that ruled over my life can
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:01.800]   no longer command me what to do because I'm dead to them.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.800]   I'm dead to them.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.680]   Have you ever talked to a dead person, tell it to do something?
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.920]   It's not going to listen to you because it's dead.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.400]   So the commands that we receive from our former masters is irrelevant to us because we are
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.400]   dead to them.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.320]   They cannot tell us what to do.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.320]   I'm dead to sin.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.320]   I'm dead to death.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.320]   I'm dead to the law.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.320]   I'm dead to Satan.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.320]   I'm dead to the world.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.120]   The life of the flesh that could not help but return to its perverse masters and abusive
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:28.200]   masters is now rotting away at the cross of Calvary.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.200]   I've been crucified with Christ.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.240]   It's no longer I who live.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.000]   So this is where we get a profound lesson.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.880]   Jesus Christ not only died so that we might live.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:38.000]   He died so that you might die.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   He died so that you might die.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.320]   But the gospel doesn't end with the cross.
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.320]   Praise the Lord.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:49.280]   If it ended with the cross, we'd just be united with him in dying.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.600]   That's not cool.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.800]   He resurrected from the dead.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.500]   And in our union with Jesus Christ, we have resurrected from the dead.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.500]   We have new life.
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:04.040]   We have been raised from the grave as a new man, again, with a new mind, a renewed conscience,
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.880]   a circumcised heart, a regenerated soul.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.800]   We are a new creation.
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.740]   We are born again.
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:14.480]   And this life that you have could do what it couldn't do before.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.760]   This new life that you have in Jesus Christ, his resurrected life, can do something that
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:22.840]   you could not do before, and that is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul,
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.080]   mind, and strength.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.640]   That's why the resurrection is so powerful.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.720]   Without it, you would not be able to love the Lord your God.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:35.800]   Now, if we have died with Christ, we believe we will also live with him.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.160]   We know that Christ being raised from the dead would never die again.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.920]   Death no longer has dominion over him.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.920]   For the death he died, he died to sin once for all.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.360]   But the life he lives, he lives to God.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:51.380]   The life that Jesus Christ lives, the resurrected life he lives, he lives towards God.
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:58.400]   So we in union with him have a life that is now lived not towards sin, but towards God.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:04.800]   Now, before I bring things to a close, I want to address the question, "Why do we continue
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:05.800]   to sin then?"
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.440]   That is an interesting question.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.720]   I think it's a logical question.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:16.240]   If we have crucified the former man, the man of sin, and we have resurrected to a new life,
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.480]   a life of glory, then why is it that we continue to sin?
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.600]   The answer is because the death and the resurrection that we experience in union with Jesus Christ
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.600]   is something that we experience spiritually.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.320]   It's what we experience spiritually.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:34.920]   And for that reason, there's a conflict between what the Bible teaches as the inner man and
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.920]   the outer man.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.400]   There's a conflict within us.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:42.040]   Romans chapter 7 verse 15 to 20 says, "For I do not understand my own actions.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:45.640]   For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.680]   Now, if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law that it is good.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:51.640]   So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.640]   For I know that nothing good dwells in me that is in my flesh.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:58.280]   For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:02.320]   For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:07.160]   Now, if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.160]   me."
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:14.800]   The reason why we sin is because the newly resurrected man conflicts with the remnant
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.320]   of our sinful flesh.
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:22.240]   But there is going to be a day when we will be freed from sin.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.160]   We are free from the power of sin through the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.640]   spiritually.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.560]   But there will be a day when we are freed from the presence of sin, and that is a day
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.560]   when we die.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:37.720]   That is a day when we physically die, experience death in a physical way, and in our physical
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:43.840]   death afterwards we are resurrected into a physical life, and we experience the fullness
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.760]   of the death and the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:54.800]   So the reason why you resurrect in the end times, the rapture of the church, the reason
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.880]   why you resurrect from the dead during the millennial kingdom and the eternal kingdom
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:03.280]   of God and have these glorified bodies is because of your union with Jesus Christ.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:09.920]   Your eternal life that you have, the eternal life that we often so talk about, is profoundly
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.760]   and essentially the life that you have in union with the Son of God.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.680]   Does that make sense?
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:22.600]   The eternal life that you have after all of this is a life, it is not a life that you
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.720]   have apart from God.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:27.280]   It is a life that you have because you are united to the Son of God.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.280]   And that is why it is eternal.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.920]   That is why your new life is an eternal life because the Son of God is eternal.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.840]   And that is why your eternal life is glorious because the resurrected life of Jesus Christ
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:36.840]   is glorious.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.600]   And that is why the eternal life that you have is also powerful because the resurrected
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.400]   life of Jesus Christ is powerful.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:47.760]   The life that you experience in end times and for all of eternity is a life that you
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:51.440]   have because of your union with the resurrected life of Jesus Christ.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.160]   Philippians chapter 3 verse 20 to 21, "But our citizenship is in heaven and from it we
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:00.480]   await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like His
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:05.560]   glorious body by the power that enables Him even to subject all things to Himself, who
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:12.920]   will transform our lowly body to be like His glorious body."
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:17.320]   Our spiritual death and resurrection is going to culminate in a physical death and resurrection
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:21.460]   at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.600]   So that is what the resurrection does.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:34.800]   And I hope it was an encouragement to you and I hope that as you begin to dive, and
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.880]   this is, we just skimmed the surface today.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.320]   We really did just skim the surface.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:42.280]   Just like the cross, man, one message is not going to do it justice.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:46.600]   But I hope it's something that will compel you to dive more deeply into scripture regarding
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:51.480]   the subject so that as you read the Word of God, as you meditate upon these truths, it
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:56.280]   will elicit more love and worship from your heart towards your God.
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:02.760]   And may you study this not to simply know it but to give God the glory which He deserves.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:07.000]   Pray with me.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:15.160]   Dear God, we are grateful for the death of Christ and we are grateful for the resurrection
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.160]   of Christ.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:21.280]   We are grateful for both these things because we know without either of them we will be
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.480]   left in our sins, in our transgressions.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.040]   We know that through these things you have saved us.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:38.320]   I pray for us as a community, I pray for Berean, that their understanding of the things of
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:44.000]   the Gospel would increase so that understanding these things that they would worship you more.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:52.240]   May they fall in love with you every day, oh God, and find out things about you that
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.800]   causes them to exult in you automatically.
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:00.840]   Father we know that it is only by your grace, it is only by your grace that we can deepen
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.800]   and further our affections for you so would your grace be upon us.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.640]   We will pray this in Jesus' name, Amen.
