[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040]   All right, this morning we have a kind of a guest speaker because he's here and most
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.040]   of you guys already know him, Pastor Aaron.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.620]   He was, him and his family was down here for Becky and Sung's wedding yesterday and so
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.980]   we thought we'd take advantage of him and I know how much we enjoy and are blessed by
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.240]   his ministry.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.800]   He used to be our associate pastor here.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.980]   He was our college pastor about four or five years ago and they took a team up and planted
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.680]   a church up in Millbrae and it's a growing church.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.320]   They have about 140, 150 members and again it's growing and thriving and so we're blessed
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.320]   by their ministry.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.320]   It's our sister church.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.200]   If you have anybody up in the Bay Area looking for a church, I strongly encourage you guys
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.240]   to look up that church, Berean Mission Church up at Millbrae.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.440]   So again, he was down here so I thought it'd be a great opportunity for us to be blessed
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.440]   through his ministry.
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.480]   So let's ask and welcome Pastor Aaron up here.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:14.800]   All right, well good morning to all of you.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.600]   I got a few comments from people as I was walking in.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.280]   Did we see you a couple weeks ago?
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.600]   And the answer is yes, we were here for another wedding.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.360]   But yeah, if I have to preach every time I'm down here, then I'm going to stop coming.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.600]   So no, I'm just kidding.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.480]   I'm kind of kidding.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.560]   Now it is a joy to be here and a joy to fellowship with all of you.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.820]   I was hoping that we could explore a topic and subject this morning that a lot of times
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.920]   in the church we only give attention to just for a few days out of the year, namely during
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.360]   Holy Week and during Easter and that's the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.320]   This is a subject matter that really is central to our faith and yet oftentimes it kind of
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.760]   takes a back seat.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.920]   And so hopefully as we turn our attention to God's Word this morning, God would speak
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.520]   to us and really impress upon us again just the importance and how significant it is that
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.960]   Christ has resurrected from the dead.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.760]   And so on that note, if you would turn with me in your Bibles to Luke chapter 24.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.480]   This morning we're going to be reading from verse 13 through verse 35.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.160]   Luke 24 verses 13 through 35.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.060]   This is God's holy and inerrant Word.
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.480]   That very day, two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.400]   Jerusalem and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.680]   While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them,
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.200]   but their eyes were kept from recognizing him.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.440]   And he said to them, "What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.080]   walk?"
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.680]   And they stood still looking sad.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.480]   Then one of them named Cleopas answered him, "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.360]   does not know the things that have happened there in these days?"
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.880]   And he said to them, "What things?"
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.040]   And they said to him, "Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet, mighty
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.520]   in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and rulers delivered
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.400]   him up to be condemned to death and crucified him.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.640]   But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.200]   Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened."
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.560]   Moreover, some women of our company amazed us.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.760]   They were at the tomb early in the morning and when they did not find his body, they
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.640]   came back saying they had even seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.880]   Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the woman had said,
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.120]   but him they did not see.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.240]   And he said to them, "O foolish ones and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.240]   have spoken, was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.280]   into his glory?"
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.440]   And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.960]   the things concerning himself.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.120]   So they drew near to the village to which they were going.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.320]   He acted as if he were going farther, but they urged him strongly saying, "Stay with
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.640]   us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent."
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.240]   So he went in to stay with them.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.600]   When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   to them.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.360]   And their eyes were opened and they recognized him and he vanished from their sight.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.040]   They said to each other, "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.680]   road, while he opened to us the scriptures?"
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.400]   And they arose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.600]   And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together saying, "The
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.400]   Lord has risen indeed and has appeared to Simon."
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.120]   Then they told what had happened on the road and how he was known to them in the breaking
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.120]   of the bread.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.560]   Let's bow our heads in prayer.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:21.520]   Our Heavenly Father, with your Word before us, we do ask that you would find us humble
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.320]   and teachable in your sight.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.160]   We pray, Lord God, that we will be challenged and equipped this morning through the scriptures
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.200]   and that, Lord, through our lives, we might seek to give honor and glory to Christ, in
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.200]   whose name we pray.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.200]   Amen.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.720]   All right.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.520]   Well, just to set up a little bit of context for us, as you guys can tell, this is a long
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.320]   passage.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.680]   The preceding passage, so basically the first twelve verses of Luke chapter 24, features
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.680]   a number of different reactions that various people had to the empty tomb.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.280]   You have a group of women, you have a pair of angels, and then you have the eleven remaining
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.320]   apostles.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:09.000]   You might think of these individuals like supporting actors in a movie or film.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.160]   The stone had been rolled away, the body of Jesus was nowhere to be found, and everyone
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.800]   was astonished and perplexed as to what was going on.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:26.200]   Well, in this morning's passage, the supporting cast will be joined by the main lead, Jesus
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.680]   Christ, who all of a sudden is thrust back into the spotlight, even though he had been
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.280]   crucified just three days before.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.880]   Now Luke, our gospel writer, he approaches his account of Jesus' resurrection slightly
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.600]   differently compared to the other gospel writers.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.080]   You see, Matthew and Mark, they only provide for us very short snippets of what took place
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:56.320]   after Jesus was resurrected, while John describes the risen Christ through a series of vignettes.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.880]   By comparison, Luke here, he takes a much more focused, a much more in-depth approach.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:08.280]   First, Luke's account is much more focused in that instead of describing a bunch of different
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:14.160]   resurrection appearances, what Luke does is he elects to zero in on a single story in
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.240]   particular, which is the subject of our study this morning.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:23.640]   At the very same time, Luke's portrayal of Christ on the Emmaus Road is described at
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.880]   length and in great detail, which is why I say that his version is a bit more in-depth
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.760]   when we compare it to the other gospel writers.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.960]   And so it's important that we read and study through Luke's account carefully if we want
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.200]   to fully appreciate everything that's happening here.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.560]   And so to that end, we're going to be breaking up our study by going through it in three
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.400]   parts if you guys are taking notes.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.480]   The first part is this, the risen Christ concealed.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.960]   We begin in verse 13.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:59.320]   That very day, two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.760]   Jerusalem.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:06.200]   And they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:11.000]   In very typical Luke fashion, Luke sets up the scene for us with a number of important
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   details.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.840]   And here's what we know.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.920]   It's still Easter Sunday.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.720]   There are two individuals and they're on a road outside of Jerusalem headed toward a
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.160]   little village called Emmaus.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.160]   What else do we know?
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.640]   Well, there's a couple of things that we know for sure, a couple more things that we can
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:34.760]   deduce based on context, and a couple more things that we can try to guess and speculate
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:40.800]   upon if we want to understand anything beyond what Luke provides for us here.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:47.200]   Now it's certain that the two people we see in this scene are followers of Christ.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:52.320]   One of them is named Cleopas, the other is left unidentified.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:58.060]   It's probable that they're on their way home, returning from all the Passover festivities
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:02.740]   that had taken place in Jerusalem just the weekend before.
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:08.560]   And finally, it's possible that Luke mentions and highlights that there are two of them
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.160]   because you see, ancient Jews required the presence of at least two witnesses whenever
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:19.600]   they were trying to establish the credibility or veracity of eyewitness testimony.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.320]   Now one kind of interesting tidbit that I came across as I was studying through this
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:29.160]   passage was in learning that the prevailing scholarly opinion seems to point to the Cleopas,
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:35.480]   who's mentioned here in Luke 24, as being the same person as the Clopas who's mentioned
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.760]   in John 19.25.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:45.760]   Here in John 19.25 it says this, "Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:52.040]   his mother's sister Mary, the wife of Clopas."
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:57.520]   Now if it's true that Cleopas and Clopas are the same individual, that would mean that
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:06.480]   Cleopas is the uncle of Jesus, which might also lead us to speculate that the other individual
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:14.240]   who's left unnamed in this passage is Cleopas' wife, Jesus' aunt Mary.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.760]   At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter because it doesn't affect our interpretation
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.840]   of this text, but I still thought it was kind of interesting to point out because if you're
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.840]   anything like me, you've long assumed that these disciples were not related to Jesus,
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:31.980]   and much less that they were a man and woman who were a married couple.
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:38.440]   At any rate, whoever they were, what we know for sure is that these two disciples were
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.820]   in a daze.
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:46.400]   They're shocked, traumatized, still reeling from the whirlwind of events that had transpired
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.920]   over the previous weekend.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.400]   It's written all over their faces, and in their body language as well.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:58.160]   We're told at the end of verse 17, "They stood still looking sad."
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.520]   Why were they sad?
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:09.160]   Unfulfilled hopes, unrealized expectations, that's why they were so sad.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:14.880]   You see, like so many others, they had banked on the hope that Jesus was the long-awaited
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.880]   Messiah.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:22.600]   They believed that Jesus had come to rule and reign over them as king, and that as Messiah,
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:28.440]   he would conquer over Caesar, and he would free them from the yoke of Roman rule.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.440]   But instead of doing any of those things, Jesus had been crucified.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.960]   He'd been executed like a common criminal, and they still could not believe what had
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.960]   happened.
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:45.240]   You see, when Jesus died, all their hopes that he might be their Messiah also died with
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.240]   him.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:53.920]   And so disoriented and distraught, their hearts heavy with pain and grief, they walk around
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.060]   in this fog of despair.
[00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:01.240]   But then seemingly out of nowhere, a stranger appears.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.840]   Look at verse 15.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:10.160]   "While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them,
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.240]   but their eyes were kept from recognizing him."
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.240]   Why do you think they were unable to recognize Jesus?
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.200]   It's kind of strange, right?
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.480]   It's not as if he were a ghost or an apparition, because if you notice, they're talking to
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.480]   him.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.480]   They're relating to him.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.040]   They're interacting with him like he's a normal human being, like an average pastor
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.040]   by.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.240]   So why is it that these two disciples fail to recognize Jesus?
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:42.380]   Well, perhaps in their distress, they simply were not in their right minds.
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:47.680]   Maybe they were so emotionally affected, so traumatized by Jesus's death that it somehow
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.640]   short-circuited their brains so they were no longer able to see or perceive things properly.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.680]   Maybe this was a form of PTSD that they were experiencing.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:03.120]   Or maybe Jesus's physical appearance had changed or been altered in some way following his
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.120]   resurrection.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:11.520]   Mark 16, verse 12 actually tells us that the risen Christ appeared in another form, whatever
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.520]   that means.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:17.740]   In fact, these two disciples, you know, they're hardly alone in their inability to recognize
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.160]   Jesus after he was raised from the dead.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.720]   One of the things that you'll notice when you read through the resurrection accounts
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:30.400]   is that people don't seem to discern when they're standing before the risen Christ.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:37.080]   In fact, Mary Magdalene mistakens Jesus to be a gardener in John chapter 20.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:42.520]   We also know that Jesus's glorified body was somehow different than it was prior to his
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.520]   resurrection.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.020]   In other words, his body was no longer normal, at least in the way that you and I would think
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.600]   of it.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.720]   For one thing, this body had the ability to disappear and then to reappear.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.760]   In fact, we see him doing this later on in this passage.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:04.120]   Jesus is even able in his glorified state to pass through locked doors as he does in
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.440]   John 20, verses 19 and 26.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:13.040]   But you know, as compelling as those theories might be, I actually believe that the real
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:21.280]   reason why these Emmaus disciples were unable to recognize Jesus is far more simple because
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.360]   the reason is actually laid out for us right there in the text itself.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.840]   Look at verse 16.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:32.240]   Their eyes were kept from recognizing him.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.280]   Their eyes were kept from recognizing him.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:39.440]   This is what theologians and commentators refer to as a divine passive.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.400]   This is in the passive voice in the Greek text.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:49.880]   In other words, God was keeping them from seeing and recognizing Jesus.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.880]   And why exactly would he want to do that?
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:15:01.520]   God was doing that because he wanted to illustrate for them the reality of their spiritual blindness.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.880]   In other words, God had temporarily veiled Jesus from their sight so that he could prove
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:06.880]   a point.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:14.320]   Namely, that their inability to see and understand who Jesus was was much more of a faith issue
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.560]   and much more of a heart issue than it was a physical one.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:23.360]   As a matter of fact, Jesus himself later rebukes these disciples in verse 25, not because they
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.240]   had poor eyesight.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.880]   He rebukes them because they were slow of heart.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.680]   Slow of heart to believe all that the prophets had spoken.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:38.520]   Which leads us to a really important point, and the point is this.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.760]   Only God.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:47.880]   God and God alone is capable of opening up our eyes so that we might see the beauty and
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.880]   the glory of Christ.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:56.960]   Without him, we remain in complete spiritual darkness.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.560]   Even if Jesus were to come here to Berean this morning and stand here in this room at
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:07.280]   this very moment, not a single one of us would be able to recognize him as Savior and Lord
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:12.640]   unless God, by his grace, willed for it to happen.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:17.480]   See the hardness and the blindness of the human heart, that is symptomatic of our fallen
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.800]   condition.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:25.480]   Our inability to see things spiritually is a result of our sin.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:35.480]   So apart from God intervening by his grace, sin and unbelief, it renders us completely
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.760]   blind to the things of God.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:45.600]   So how then can you and I see and behold Christ in a saving way?
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.960]   That's an important question to consider, especially if there are any of you who are
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.680]   really doing your best to reach out to loved ones in your lives.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:59.640]   You're doing everything you can to convince them that the gospel is true.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:05.160]   How can we get those people, and maybe even for ourselves, how can we get ourselves to
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.400]   see and behold Christ in a saving way?
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.840]   Well, we need new eyes.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.840]   We need a new heart.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:18.960]   Or as the Bible puts it, we need to be born again.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.640]   But being born again is something that cannot and will not ever happen because of our choice.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:31.120]   The sad fact that we are spiritually blind means that on our own we are absolutely and
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:36.680]   completely unable to see or recognize Jesus.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:42.720]   God by his grace, God by his mercy, needs to come and do something.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.240]   He needs to grant us saving faith.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:52.400]   And that is why Christians rejoice in the fact that salvation is a free gift.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.040]   It's not earned or attained by our merit, our worthiness.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:02.080]   No, salvation is totally owing to God, sovereignly moving within our hearts by the power of his
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.880]   Holy Spirit so that we might have saving faith.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:15.160]   So then I want to ask you this morning, have you asked God for the eyes of faith?
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.680]   If you're not a Christian this morning, it's great that you're here, but my encouragement
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:24.560]   to you is don't be satisfied with simply coming to church.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:30.600]   Ask God for eyes to see, for the spiritual vision to see and behold Christ so that you
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.880]   might understand who he is.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.120]   And if you are a Christian this morning, then we praise God.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:42.680]   We praise God that we have received this spiritual vision that we're talking about.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:47.560]   But it's all the more reason why you and I should be eager to dedicate and devote our
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:55.000]   entire lives to giving God glory, honor, and praise.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.360]   Picking it back up, beginning from verse 17.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.840]   And he said to them, "What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.560]   walk?"
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.120]   And they stood still looking sad.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.760]   Then one of them named Cleopas answered him, "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.600]   does not know the things that have happened there in these days?"
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.920]   And he said to them, "What things?"
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.840]   And they said to him, "Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet, mighty
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.720]   in deed and word before God and all the people, and how our chief priests and rulers delivered
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.400]   him up to be condemned to death and crucified him.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.960]   But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:43.200]   Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened."
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.400]   Such as he did throughout the time when he was alive.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:50.400]   When Jesus died, it generated great buzz throughout ancient Palestine.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:58.020]   It was headline news, which is why Cleopas is so taken aback by Jesus' question here.
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.200]   He reacts to this stranger on the road.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.760]   "Have you been living under a rock?
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.080]   How do you not know what's going on?
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.720]   Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who is unaware of the things that have happened
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.160]   here?"
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.520]   In the Greek text, the word "you" in Cleopas' reply in verse 18 is actually placed at the
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.960]   head of the sentence, which means that it's in the emphatic position.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:26.600]   So it's as if Cleopas is pointing his finger at the stranger who stands before him, and
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.280]   he's calling him out.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:34.480]   He's incredulous that he somehow remains uninformed about Jesus' crucifixion.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:43.240]   Now, of course, the great irony of this entire situation is that what Cleopas says is the
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:48.680]   exact opposite of what's actually taking place.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:54.440]   He's claiming that the man he speaks to is the only one who does not understand the things
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:21:02.280]   that happen in Jerusalem, when the reality is the man he speaks to is the only one who
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:07.200]   understands what happened in Jerusalem.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.240]   Jesus died, but it wasn't just that.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.280]   For everybody else, they assume that's where the story ended.
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:23.000]   Jesus died, but Jesus himself understood that he did not just die, but he died for our sins.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.920]   In other words, he embraced his role to be our atoning sacrifice.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:33.040]   He knew full well all that he would have to endure upon the cross.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.200]   He said so himself on multiple occasions throughout the gospel accounts.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.680]   Repeatedly, again and again, he claimed that it was necessary that the Son of Man suffer
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.800]   and die.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.640]   He understood.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.960]   It was everyone else who failed to understand.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.880]   Well, these disciples, they continue to reveal their ignorance.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.680]   Look at verse 22.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.960]   "Moreover, some women of our company amazed us.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.360]   They were at the tomb early in the morning, and when they did not find his body, they
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:08.800]   came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels who said that he was alive.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.960]   Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the woman had said,
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:18.560]   but him they did not see."
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.120]   Him they did not see.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:27.080]   These disciples, they're just relaying a report.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.940]   No one saw when they went to the tomb, no one saw Jesus, but that description might
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.800]   as well have been applicable to themselves.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.160]   Him they did not see.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:41.600]   The risen Christ remained concealed from their sight.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:47.240]   Despite the fact that by this point in time, multiple parties had come forward to testify
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:55.360]   that Jesus' body was no longer in the tomb, these two individuals simply could not consider
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:02.400]   even the remote possibility that Jesus might have been resurrected from the dead.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.600]   You know, we have this tendency as modern day readers of Scripture to look at the ancients,
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:12.040]   to look at those who lived in the first century, and to dismiss them as being unintellectual,
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:16.200]   as being gullible, as being unscientific.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:22.000]   But the gospel accounts portray them as being just as skeptical as any of us might be if
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.640]   this were to happen today.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.120]   They wanted proof.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.460]   They wanted to see some evidence.
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:35.280]   The thing is, God had provided all the proof they should have needed.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:40.000]   They were standing before the risen Christ.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.300]   But again, the problem was not their physical eyes.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.880]   It was their spiritual eyes.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.680]   To them, the empty tomb was not good news.
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.080]   It was troubling news.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:55.760]   And so they wondered to themselves, "What happened to Jesus' body?
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.040]   Did the Romans do something to it?
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.720]   Did the Jews come and dispose of it?
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.920]   What happened?"
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:08.480]   Apparently for them, standing before a resurrected man was not enough.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:17.080]   And so Jesus chose to reveal himself in a different, we might even say a more ordinary
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:21.420]   kind of way, bringing us to our second point this morning.
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.660]   The risen Christ revealed.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:25.660]   Look at verse 25.
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:30.860]   "And he said to them, 'O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.380]   prophets have spoken!
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:38.560]   Is it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?'
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.760]   And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:48.000]   the things concerning himself."
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.800]   You know, if there was ever a time where it was okay or appropriate to share the gospel
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.840]   without using the Bible, this would have been it.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:04.000]   Jesus had all the empirical data, all the evidence he needed to convince these disciples
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.420]   of who he was.
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.680]   All he needed to do was point them to his body.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.680]   "Look!
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:16.280]   Look at my body, my glorified body, incontrovertible proof that the gospel is true."
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:21.480]   But notice that instead of pointing to himself, what does our Savior do?
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:25.280]   He points them to God's Word.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.280]   I can't even begin to tell you guys the number of times where I've shared the gospel
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:34.440]   with someone, where I've been in an evangelistic conversation, where I've wished for the
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.480]   power to perform some sign or do some miracle.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.960]   Because it would make so many things so much easier in evangelism.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.760]   "Oh, you don't believe that the gospel is true?
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.800]   Watch me turn this water into wine."
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.800]   Right?
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.000]   "Oh, you don't believe that Jesus died for your sins on the cross?
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.480]   Watch me as I heal this man of his disease."
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.480]   Bam, like that.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:00.720]   There would be converts left and right, or so we would assume.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:07.160]   But notice here, rather than simply pointing these two individuals to the greatest miracle
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:14.960]   of all human history, the resurrection, his own resurrected body, Jesus directs them to
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.360]   the Bible instead.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:24.760]   See, signs and miracles, as great as they might be, they are insufficient grounds for
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.120]   saving faith.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:33.680]   First Romans 10.17 explains, "Faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the what?
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:37.080]   The Word of Christ."
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:43.000]   That's the reason why Berean Community Church has always strived to place such a high premium
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.840]   on God's Word.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:51.680]   Our leaders know that these days people are very likely to come into the church if there's
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.880]   glitz and flash and well thought out programs and strategies.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:01.880]   But what is practical is not always what's biblical.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:07.260]   And so even if people consider it to be boring, even if some of you consider this exercise
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:15.680]   to be dry, it is every church's responsibility to preach the Word of God.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.480]   And it's not because the Bible saves people.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.600]   This is just a book, okay?
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:26.080]   You can purchase it on Amazon for 20 bucks.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.680]   This is just a copy of a translation of some original manuscripts that date back thousands
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.680]   of years.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.840]   We're not saying that the Word of God is important because this physical book has some sort of
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.080]   magical power.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:43.040]   We believe that the Word of God is important because it's Christ who saves, and it is through
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.520]   the written Word that the living Word is revealed.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:53.120]   And that is why we place our confidence and our trust in Scripture.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:28:01.000]   So I want to ask you, Christian, do you know your Bible well enough to explain who Jesus
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.640]   is and why He came?
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:11.360]   Are you familiar enough with the teachings of Scripture to articulate the gospel clearly?
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:17.840]   When you evangelize, is your confidence based on your personality, your charisma, your strategy,
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:27.760]   your knowledge, or is it based upon the sufficiency of Christ and His Word?
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:34.360]   Once again, the main thing that keeps people from believing in Jesus, the main thing that
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:40.760]   keeps people from the kingdom of God has never been a lack or absence of physical proof and
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.760]   evidence.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.240]   That's never been the issue.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:48.560]   Rather, it is the simple fact that we as sinners are spiritually blind.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.520]   That's the issue.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:55.640]   And so then the only solution to this problem we have of our spiritual blindness is to bring
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:04.280]   forth the illumination that can only come from God's Spirit working through His Word.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.400]   Remember what the Savior taught in Luke 16.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:13.640]   If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.400]   should rise from the dead.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.960]   And how true that was even here in this passage.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.720]   So use the Bible.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.560]   Be a Berean.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.960]   Trust in Scripture.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.900]   Here our Lord does exactly that.
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.880]   He reveals Himself by using what the Bible says.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:38.200]   Besides the Sermon on the Mount, this sermon that was preached that afternoon on the Emmaus
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:42.320]   Road is perhaps the most famous message that our Lord ever taught.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:48.840]   As a matter of fact, I would argue that it was the most Christ-centered, Gospel-centered,
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:52.680]   Word-centered sermon of all time.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:59.360]   Because beginning with Moses and all the prophets, He interpreted to them in all the Scriptures
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:04.160]   the things concerning Himself.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:09.240]   That phrase, Moses and the prophets, there in verse 27, was just another way that first-century
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:16.860]   Jews referred to the Hebrew Scriptures, what you and I call today the Old Testament.
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:22.380]   And generally speaking, a lot of us have made the mistake of assuming that only the New
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:28.000]   Testament talks about Jesus, but that the Old Testament never ever speaks about Him
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.200]   at all.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.520]   The problem with that understanding is that the Old Testament, the first 39 books in your
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:38.820]   Bibles are fundamentally about Jesus.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.080]   The Old Testament is fundamentally about Christ.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:48.920]   See, Jesus even rebuked the Pharisees, the so-called experts in the Hebrew Scriptures,
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:55.320]   precisely because their knowledge and expertise of the Old Testament Scriptures did not yield
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.480]   worship of Christ.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:03.240]   So how exactly does Jesus fulfill the Old Testament Scriptures?
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:07.680]   Well, I'm glad you guys asked the question.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.840]   In the book of Genesis, Christ is revealed as the seed of the woman who would one day
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.460]   crush the head of the serpent.
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:18.040]   In the book of Exodus, Christ is revealed as a Passover lamb.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.860]   In the book of Leviticus, Christ is revealed as our great high priest.
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:25.920]   In the book of Numbers, Christ is revealed as our ever-present guide.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.680]   In the book of Deuteronomy, Christ is revealed as Moses-like prophet.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.860]   In Joshua, Christ is revealed as commander of the Lord's army.
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:37.660]   In Judges, Christ is revealed as our ultimate deliverer.
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.740]   In Ruth, Christ is revealed as kinsman redeemer.
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:44.620]   In 1 and 2 Samuel, Christ is revealed as trustworthy prophet.
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:48.600]   In Kings and Chronicles, Christ is revealed as king of all kings.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.360]   In Ezra, Christ is revealed as faithful scribe.
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.620]   In Nehemiah, Christ is revealed as rebuilder of the walls.
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:58.280]   In Esther, Christ is revealed as the advocate of God's people.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.400]   In Job, Christ is revealed as living redeemer.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.400]   In Psalms, Christ is revealed as a good shepherd.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:09.200]   In Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, Christ is revealed as wisdom from above.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:13.240]   In Song of Solomon, Christ is revealed as loving bridegroom.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.160]   In Isaiah, Christ is revealed as suffering servant.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.180]   In Jeremiah, Christ is revealed as a righteous branch.
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:22.240]   In Lamentations, Christ is revealed as weeping prophet.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.080]   In Ezekiel, Christ is revealed as shepherd king.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.440]   In Daniel, Christ is revealed as a son of man.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.180]   In Hosea, Christ is revealed as faithful husband.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.760]   In Joel, Christ is revealed as the sender of the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.880]   In Amos, Christ is revealed as a bearer of our burdens.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.960]   In Obadiah, Christ is revealed as righteous judge.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:45.600]   In Jonah, Christ is revealed as the one who would rise on the third day.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.200]   In Micah, Christ is revealed as bearer of good news.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.000]   In Nahum, Christ is revealed as the avenger of God's elect.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.840]   In Habakkuk, Christ is revealed as divine watchman.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.200]   In Zephaniah, Christ is revealed as savior of Israel.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.880]   In Haggai, Christ is revealed as a restorer of all things.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:03.640]   In Zechariah, Christ is revealed as a humble king mounted upon a colt.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:08.920]   In Malachi, Christ is revealed as the son of righteousness.
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:15.480]   And so you see the entirety of the Old Testament scriptures point to Jesus.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.120]   He's the linchpin.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:23.080]   He's the fulcrum upon which all of redemptive history rests.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.680]   And therefore, Jesus is the key.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:28.240]   He's the key to understanding what the Bible's all about.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:34.920]   That is why Paul said in 2 Corinthians 1:20, "For all the promises of God find their yes
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.320]   in Him."
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:43.480]   And that is why it is through Him we utter our amen to God for His glory.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:49.280]   So you see, Jesus, He's not just the link, okay?
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:53.960]   He's not just the glue that holds a random assortment of Bible stories together.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:58.520]   Jesus is the story.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.960]   Christ is the story.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:06.760]   Well, as the risen Lord delivers His sermon, how do these disciples respond?
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.400]   Look at verse 32.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:13.720]   "They said to each other, 'Did not our hearts burn within us while He talked to us on the
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:19.800]   road, while He opened to us the scriptures?'"
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:25.280]   These disciples, they're experiencing what I refer to as a holy heartburn.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.280]   This is a good kind of heartburn.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.480]   Not the kind of heartburn you experience after eating late night tacos.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.080]   This is a holy heartburn.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:39.280]   And it happens any time anybody is exposed to the truth of God's Word and God's Spirit
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:45.720]   moves within them to stir up affections and passion and love for Christ.
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:51.200]   And that kind of holy heartburn is the best thing that you and I can ever experience.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:35:00.280]   Sadly, however, most of the time when we have God's Word open before us in a sermon, in
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:07.120]   a Bible study, while we're doing our quiet times, our hearts are not burning.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.520]   Instead what's happening?
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:16.480]   Our eyes are closing, and our heads are bobbing, and our minds are wandering.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:21.520]   But if that's the case for you, my encouragement to you is simply this.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.660]   Keep at it.
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:25.660]   Keep at it.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:26.660]   Keep at God's Word.
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.440]   Don't give up.
[00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:34.720]   I firmly, firmly believe, as your leaders do, that when we grow in our love and understanding
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.200]   of Scripture, we grow in our love and understanding of Christ.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.000]   Those two things come intertwined.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.280]   So don't be discouraged.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.360]   Commit to a reading plan.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.560]   Ask someone next to you to hold you accountable.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:52.560]   Cultivate a habit and spiritual discipline of getting to God's Word on a daily basis
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:58.720]   because it is primarily through the Word of God that the beauty of Christ is revealed.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.320]   Do you want to see Jesus?
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.320]   Look at His Word.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:08.440]   Our third and final point for this morning, the risen Christ recognized.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:16.440]   Jesus, He wraps up His sermon, and here's what happens next in verse 28.
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:19.680]   So they drew near to the village to which they were going.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:23.920]   He acted as if He were going farther, but they urged Him strongly, saying, "Stay with
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:29.520]   us, for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent."
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.640]   The Greek here is very forceful.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:37.640]   In fact, the wording pictures these two individuals basically coercing Jesus to stay with them.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:44.200]   So this is not just another example of ancient Near Eastern hospitality at work.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:51.280]   This is a desperate, forceful plea by these disciples to get this mysterious stranger
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:54.720]   to stay with them for just a little while longer.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.440]   In other words, they're not just being insistent, okay?
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.440]   They're being persistent.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:05.640]   They don't know who this man is, but they're drawn to Him.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:10.080]   They're compelled and intrigued by what He has to say.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.760]   So Luke tells us that He went in to stay with them.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.280]   Look at verse 30.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:18.560]   When He was at table with them, He took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.320]   to them.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:28.240]   And their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him, and He vanished from their sight.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:34.200]   I want you to notice that even though Jesus was invited as a guest, here He becomes the
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.840]   host.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.360]   Taking the bread, He says a blessing.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:42.760]   He starts to serve those who have invited Him into their home.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:48.080]   Do you guys remember it was just a few days before, on the night before He was betrayed,
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:54.240]   where Christ took bread, He broke it, He said a blessing, and He had what's called the last
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:57.760]   supper with His disciples.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:03.240]   Well here in Luke 24, we have the first supper of the risen Lord.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:10.840]   And it's as they sit around this table that their eyes were opened, verse 31 says.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.640]   It's a grammatical parallel to what was said in verse 16, that divine passage, their eyes
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.380]   were kept from seeing Christ.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.720]   Well here their eyes were opened.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.720]   God reveals.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.880]   Previously, God concealed.
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:27.160]   Here God reveals, and as a result, they are able to recognize Jesus.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:31.960]   And then the passage concludes in verse 33.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   And they arose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.240]   those who were with them, and gathered together, saying, "The Lord has risen indeed, and has
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.520]   appeared to Simon."
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.920]   Then they told what had happened on the road and how He was known to them in the breaking
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:47.920]   of the bread.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.280]   So if you guys have been tracking with me, that's a long passage, but now we've come
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.320]   full circle.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:39:01.020]   The passage began with two disciples looking sad as they walked away from Jerusalem.
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:10.800]   And now the passage ends with two disciples rejoicing and glad as they run toward Jerusalem.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:16.480]   Despite the lateness of the hour, these two disciples, they make that seven-mile journey
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.320]   all the way back to the holy city.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.640]   Again, this is a time before Uber.
[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.440]   This is a time before Lyft.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:26.720]   They're walking on foot back to Jerusalem, even though they had just come from there
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:32.600]   earlier that same day, but what they had seen and what they had heard was just way too amazing
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.120]   to keep to themselves.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.960]   And so they go.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:42.360]   They go so they might tell other people, because that's what happens when you encounter the
[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.640]   risen Christ in a saving way.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:50.800]   You don't go home and plop on the couch and turn on Netflix and waste the remainder of
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.080]   your life away.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:40:02.040]   No, you go and you share the good news that Jesus has risen from the dead.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:06.840]   And when they finally arrive in Jerusalem, no doubt by this time it's very, very late,
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:11.760]   the two amazed disciples, they burst through the doors and they immediately inform Jesus'
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:17.040]   11 remaining disciples that Christ has resurrected from the dead.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:24.720]   But as it turns out, the 11, they already know, because the news of Christ's resurrection
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.680]   has already begun to spread.
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.840]   This must have been kind of disappointing for the two disciples, you know?
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.720]   I mean, that seven-mile journey back, they're like, "Man, they're going to be overjoyed
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.760]   when they hear us deliver this news that they haven't heard."
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.740]   And then so they come through the doors, they're like, "Christ is risen."
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:45.720]   And the 11 respond, "He is risen indeed."
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:49.480]   That Paschal greeting, the Easter greeting that we always exchange to one another on
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:53.320]   Easter morning.
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.960]   In closing, I just want to ask one final question.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.880]   Why does a resurrection matter?
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:03.960]   I know Easter was like last month, so why are we talking about this now?
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:09.800]   Too often the resurrection is attached as an addendum, a postscript to our faith, as
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:16.200]   if it's kind of important but not really like something that belongs front and center.
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:19.880]   No doubt the cross of Jesus Christ is central.
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:22.360]   No doubt.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:27.560]   But not to diminish the cross, the resurrection is equally important.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.320]   Why does a resurrection matter?
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:34.760]   For one, the resurrection matters because it means that Christ has accepted the penalty
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.200]   that Jesus paid for us on the cross.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:42.200]   Of course, more than one preacher throughout church history has likened the resurrection
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.640]   of Christ to a receipt.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:49.200]   When you guys walk into Target, you guys walk into Lucky or what do you guys have here?
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.200]   Vons.
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:51.200]   I'm forgetting the supermarket.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.200]   Ralph's, okay?
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:55.640]   And you buy something, you get a receipt.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.880]   That receipt is proof of payment that you've purchased this thing.
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:06.520]   Well, when Jesus was raised from the dead, it was as if God himself handed a receipt
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:13.480]   to the world saying that the penalty that was rendered at Calvary was accepted, which
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:17.800]   means there's no further penalty for you to pay.
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:22.840]   We live at peace with God the Father and we have confidence in coming before him because
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.920]   there's no more penalty to pay.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:30.320]   As Jesus cried out from the cross, "It is finished."
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:35.840]   The resurrection also matters because it means that eschatology has already begun.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:41.080]   You guys are currently going through a revelation series during midweeks, am I right?
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:44.120]   And hopefully one of the truths that will begin to emerge as you make your way through
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:48.920]   that book is that eschatology is already here.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:54.280]   It's not just for some far off distant future because you see when Jesus was risen from
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.360]   the dead, here's how Paul puts it in 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:02.200]   He became the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.400]   That's just a euphemism for those who have died.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.640]   Jesus, the resurrected Christ, is the first fruits for those of us who have died and we
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.040]   will all die.
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:18.800]   But when Jesus was raised from the dead, that signified to the world a new creation has
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.320]   already begun.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.960]   And yet having said that, we take a look at this world around us and we see that it's
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:30.560]   broken and it's falling apart still.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:34.600]   It seems that the old creation is very much in place.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:39.040]   So yes, a new creation is already here, but it's not yet here.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:43.660]   We live in the already not yet, this weird in between stage.
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:50.320]   And so as we look forward to the time where God will finish recreating the world, we look
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:56.020]   back at the resurrection of Christ to give us a glimpse and a foreshadowing of what things
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:44:01.160]   will look like when God has finished making all things new.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:06.920]   And when He does, it will be a glorious, glorious day.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:12.480]   Thirdly and finally, the resurrection matters, and this is very simple, because it means
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.880]   that Jesus is alive.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.720]   Jesus is alive.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:24.080]   Far too many of us, we regard Jesus like we regard the historical figures that we studied
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:33.480]   about or read about in school, Martin Luther King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, Steve Jobs, men
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:39.400]   who at one point in history had great impact, but quite frankly, who bear little to no relevance
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:42.320]   to our lives today.
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:46.320]   But that's not Jesus, because Jesus is not like them.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:55.160]   Jesus is alive, and He's right here, and He's right now present among us.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:45:00.600]   If there are any in this room who feel something akin to what those disciples felt on the Emmaus
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:07.760]   Road that first Easter afternoon 2,000 years ago, weighed down because of unfulfilled hopes,
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:12.920]   disheartened and discouraged and wearied because life didn't pan out the way that you had planned,
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:16.040]   I want you to understand something.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:26.600]   Christ knows and sees and meets you right where you are, because He is alive.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.440]   He's not some image.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:29.760]   He's not some statue.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.540]   He's not some relic.
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:38.360]   He's a person to engage with, a person to pray to, a person to have a relationship with.
[00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.420]   He's actively working in your life right now.
[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:44.320]   At this very moment, He's indwelling many of your hearts.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.720]   He can come to your aid.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.000]   He can intercede for you.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.760]   He can empower you and strengthen you and encourage you and do any of the things that
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:56.040]   any of your friends might be able to do, but He can do it better, because He is the risen
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.320]   King.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:04.760]   And if you behold Him with eyes of faith, then you can see Him just as clearly and just
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:11.600]   as vividly as those two disciples did on the Emmaus Road.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:21.880]   So in closing, I want to ask, have you recognized Jesus for who He truly is, the risen one,
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.440]   the living one?
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.120]   There is hope.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:33.920]   There's great hope because of Jesus' resurrection, and that hope means everything.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:40.120]   I want to close by reading from one final passage in 1 Peter 1, and then we'll follow
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:43.640]   with the time of communion.
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:48.320]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:52.320]   According to His great mercy, He has caused us to be born again to a living hope through
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:57.480]   the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance that is imperishable,
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:03.280]   undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, who by God's power are being guarded
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:08.120]   through faith for salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:13.120]   Let's bow our heads in prayer.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:19.720]   Father, we thank you for the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:26.560]   We thank you, Lord God, that through that resurrection, we have the hope of a new life.
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:34.160]   And we pray, Lord God, that you would remind us and cause us, Lord God, to be encouraged
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:41.080]   in knowing, Lord God, that the living Christ now empowers us today.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.680]   Help us, Lord God, not to hang our heads in despondency or fear.
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:51.240]   Yes, this world around us is harsh, and yes, life can be very, very difficult, but there
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:56.680]   is a new age dawning where a new creation, Lord God, will be consummated in the new heavens
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:57.680]   and the new earth.
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.320]   We are excited, and we long, Lord God, for that day.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:07.760]   But in the meanwhile, Lord, we remember that Christ has already begun that process.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:13.080]   So help us, Lord God, to live in light of the new life that we have because of Jesus.
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:18.640]   And may this church be a place, Lord God, that honors and glorifies you in all that
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:19.640]   it does.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.640]   We pray these things in Jesus' name.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:22.080]   Amen.
