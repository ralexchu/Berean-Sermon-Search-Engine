[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 10.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.120]   And I'm going to start reading from verse 1 all the way to verse 8 today.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.840]   Romans chapter 10, verse 1 through 8.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.760]   "Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.960]   For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.240]   For being ignorant of the righteousness of God and seeking to establish their own, they
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.120]   did not submit to God's righteousness.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.560]   For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.600]   For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.960]   the commandments shall live by them.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.380]   But the righteousness based on faith says, 'Do not say in your heart who will ascend
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.560]   into heaven, that is to bring Christ down, or who will descend into abyss, that is to
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.640]   bring Christ up from the dead.'
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.880]   But what does it say?
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.200]   The word is near you in your mouth and in your heart.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.280]   This is the word of faith that we proclaim."
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.360]   Let's pray.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.120]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you so much for today.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.760]   We thank you for your living word.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.680]   We thank you for constantly guiding and leading us.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.820]   You truly are beyond comprehension, worthy of our praise.
[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.660]   We want to come and thank you.
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.340]   We pray that your word would speak to us and give us the energy and the strength that we
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.940]   need to live day to day.
[00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.780]   So we entrust this time to you, Lord.
[00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.060]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.580]   Amen.
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.540]   We've been talking about in Romans chapter 9, 10, and 11, Paul is specifically addressing
[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.500]   how the gospel relates to the nation of Israel.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.180]   Because Paul has been expositing why all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
[00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.500]   and his need of the grace of God in order to be saved.
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.600]   And so the obvious reaction of the Jews is, then what about us?
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.760]   If we've been trying to keep the law, and we thought that if we just did the right things
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.060]   and kept the Sabbath and went to the temple and gave sacrifices, and we followed what
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.860]   we thought the scripture said, that we would be saved, and then Paul says, "No, that is
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.280]   not it at all.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.380]   Those who live by the law will be condemned by the law, and those who don't live by the
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.940]   law will be condemned without the law."
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.680]   And so he's been trying to address that issue in chapter 9 about the sovereignty of God.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.400]   Chapter 10, the text that we've been at, basically Paul begins by saying, "Brothers, my heart's
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.980]   desire is that I desire that they would be saved."
[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.660]   And then he says, "Their problem was not that they lacked zeal.
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:57.020]   Nobody gave as much effort as the Jews did to pray, to read the Bible, to even proselytize,
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.700]   even giving sacrificially."
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.260]   Everything that you and I would superficially look at and say, "Well, that's a great Christian.
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.500]   That's a committed, on-fire Christian."
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.660]   They had all the external things to signify that they were close to God, and yet Jesus,
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.980]   and in the Gospels, it says they are just as far as the Gentiles.
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.020]   I remember years ago, there was a young lady that I met, and she told me that she was a
[00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:31.940]   Sunday school teacher at a large church that I know of, and she was a Sunday school teacher
[00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.820]   at the youth group for over five years.
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.980]   And so immediately I thought, "Wow, that's great," because I had friends that went to
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.340]   that church, and I actually had pastor friends who ministered at that church, not at the
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.940]   time that she was there.
[00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.420]   But as we were talking, I was interested in about her faith and how she came to Christ,
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.340]   and immediately it caught my attention because she couldn't explain how she came to Christ.
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.340]   So I was kind of curious.
[00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.980]   You know, you were a Sunday school teacher teaching kids for over five years, and so
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.380]   I just, out of curiosity, I asked her, "Do you know what the Gospel is?"
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.160]   She couldn't explain the Gospel.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.160]   She couldn't explain.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.220]   If somebody wanted to be saved, and they came to church and asked you, "How can I be saved?
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.160]   What would you tell them?"
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.740]   And she started to just kind of, "Well, you need to come to church faithfully.
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.940]   You've got to listen to your parents."
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.080]   And she was telling me all of this stuff, and I was just dumbfounded that this person
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.220]   was teaching Sunday school for five years and did not understand the Gospel.
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.340]   And she herself, if based upon what we know of Scripture says, can't explain how she came
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.600]   to faith, or even if she came to faith.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:48.580]   As strange as that may sound to some of you, I've run into so many people who've been in
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.820]   the church for a certain period of time who just assumed that they knew, who just assumed
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.060]   that when they died, that they're going to go to heaven.
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.060]   They just assumed it.
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.820]   They heard something when they were young, or they grew up in the church, or that's just
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.520]   what you're supposed to do.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.020]   And just culturally, they identified with Christianity.
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.940]   And so obviously, whether the Gospel was taught, and again, I believe that the Gospel was being
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.300]   taught at that church, but for whatever the reason, she just tuned it out.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.700]   See, the Jews lived all their lives.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.820]   They knew the Old Testament than any of us, any modern day scholar today, compared to
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.100]   an average Jew at that time, because they memorized the whole thing.
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.660]   They knew the law.
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:38.040]   I mean, they fasted twice a week, every single week, Tuesday and Thursday.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.100]   You know anybody who does that on a regular basis?
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.100]   They gave a tenth.
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.700]   In fact, if you were a faithful Jew, according to the commandments of the Old Testament,
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.940]   you would be giving somewhere around 30% of your income.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.540]   Today we talk about 10%, and people have a fit.
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.540]   10%.
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.820]   You know, and I remember somebody telling me, "10% of my income is a Mercedes Benz every
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.260]   five years."
[00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.580]   If you were a faithful Jew, you probably gave somewhere around 30, 35% of your income, and
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.580]   that was just mandatory.
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.900]   And then on top of that, they gave what's called a freewill offering, when they were
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.780]   thankful and they wanted to give out of the spontaneity, because God did something great,
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.900]   and they would give on top of that.
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.340]   So a good Jew would have minimum given 30, 35%.
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:28.140]   So if you were looking superficially on the surface who these Jews were, they were excellent.
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:35.900]   And yet, when Paul preaches the same gospel, he says, "It wasn't because they lacked zeal.
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.340]   It wasn't because they weren't giving enough.
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.860]   It wasn't because they didn't give enough sacrifices at the temple."
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.460]   He says, "They had zeal without knowledge."
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.380]   So in the previous weeks, we talked about how the knowledge that he's talking about
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.660]   is epinosis.
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.940]   And epinosis, whenever you see the word "epi" in front of the word, it's for the purpose
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:57.940]   of emphasis.
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.160]   So he's not simply talking about, "Oh, they didn't have the right theology about God."
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.660]   Though that could be a part of it, it's definitely a big part of it.
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.740]   If you don't have the right view of God, definitely you're not going to be able to worship God
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.740]   properly.
[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.540]   But the word "epi" in front of it is for the purpose of intensity.
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.740]   That they knew something about God, but it wasn't in depth.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.900]   They knew about God, but they didn't know Him.
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:28.540]   I think a couple weeks ago, when we were in the previous passage, we talked about how
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:35.580]   Jesus says, or in the passage, Paul concludes that the reason why they missed the gospel
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.540]   is because they missed Christ.
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:46.260]   They were dedicated to the law of God, but he says all of it, the end of the law is Christ.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.580]   So again, we talked about that last week.
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:53.500]   You can come to church, serve, give, even evangelize, but if it doesn't lead you to
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.180]   Christ, if it doesn't cause other people to be led to Christ, if your love for Christ
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.900]   isn't increasing with the knowledge that you have of the word of God, if your fellowship
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.540]   or your gathering of the people doesn't inspire one another to love Christ more, then you
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.780]   missed the whole point because he says the end of the law is Christ.
[00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.940]   The goal of the law is Christ.
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.580]   The fulfillment of the law is Christ.
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:22.100]   And then because of that, the termination of the law was because of Christ.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.340]   So again, that's the context that we have to make sure that we're reading chapter 10
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:31.780]   verse 5 within the context of Paul making this argument that if you miss Christ, you
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:37.940]   missed not something, you know, you don't get a B or a C, you fail.
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.620]   If you miss Christ, it isn't something important in the church, it is the essence of the church.
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:47.660]   The head of the body of the church is Christ.
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:53.240]   So if the head of the church is Christ and you're not growing in affection for Christ,
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.160]   you may grow in affection for the lost.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.160]   You may grow in affection for the poor.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.740]   You may grow in affection for your brothers and sisters in the church.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.540]   You may grow in affection for Berean Community Church.
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:09.440]   But if it is not a growing affection for Christ, you missed the whole point of Christianity.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.380]   You missed the whole point of the law.
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:17.140]   So again, within that context, after he says the end of the law is Christ, in verse 5,
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:22.940]   for Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.300]   them, does the commandment, shall live by them.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.140]   So let's examine what that means.
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.940]   So there's three things that I want to look at this morning in this text.
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:38.020]   A, salvation by works requires absolute perfection.
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.980]   The only reason why anybody even attempts salvation by works is because they have no
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:46.180]   idea the requirement of salvation by works.
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:54.140]   Typically, when you talk to somebody who confesses that if I do good enough, if I did enough
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:10:01.500]   right things, that if my good balances and it's heavier than the bad that I did, then
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.780]   they feel safe.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.940]   That's typically what people think.
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:10.020]   I've never heard anybody that says, "You know, I've never sinned."
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.940]   Even the most arrogant and proud person will never say, "I've never sinned."
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.300]   They just typically think that I'm not that bad.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.380]   Of course, I'm not perfect.
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.500]   I'm only human.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.500]   I'm not that bad.
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.660]   My good outweighs the bad, which may be the case.
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:32.300]   And I've met plenty of moral people, more moral than me, more upright, more generous,
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:37.060]   more giving, more compassionate.
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.820]   But they completely missed the whole point.
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:45.220]   So the point that Paul makes in verse five, when he says Christ is the end of the law,
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:50.640]   he reminds us, yeah, there is a system where Moses introduced that righteousness that's
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:57.060]   based on the law, if the person obeys the commandment, he shall live by them.
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.900]   Again, the only reason why you have confidence in that is because you have no idea what the
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:02.900]   law requires.
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:08.300]   James chapter 2, 9 and 10, it says, "But if you show partiality, you are committing sin
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.500]   and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:16.700]   For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:21.020]   For he who said, 'Do not commit adultery,' also said, 'Do not murder.'
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:25.460]   If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law."
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:32.980]   Now he gave two very extreme examples of adultery and murder.
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:36.820]   But the point that Paul was making, or James was making in the book of James, was not about
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:40.380]   murder, because he's not talking to murderers.
[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:45.680]   He wasn't pointing out the sin of adultery because he doesn't mention adultery as a primary
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.780]   sin in the book of James.
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:51.660]   Some of you guys who may have studied through the book of James know that the primary issue
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:57.500]   that Paul was dealing with was partiality toward rich people instead of the poor.
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:02.300]   That the rich people were receiving honor in the church and the poor people were not.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:07.020]   And so the poor people were envying the rich and the rich people were proud.
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.900]   And so he was telling the Christians, if you show partiality, you're breaking the law of
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.380]   God.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:17.580]   If you who are rich are arrogant because of your riches and you don't give to a brother
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.560]   who is poor, you are also arrogant before God.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:26.860]   So the sin he's referring to is not adultery, is not murder.
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:33.140]   He's talking about a sin that dwells in probably every single one of us.
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:37.080]   Somebody's better looking, somebody has better grades, somebody has a better personality,
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.420]   they dress better, they smell better.
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:46.340]   And we try not to, but the partiality, the prejudice that we have in our hearts, that
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.980]   indwells in every single person.
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:52.820]   You know, say, "Oh, you know, there's a certain this type of people are racist or those people
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:53.820]   over there are racist."
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.580]   I think racism is in each one of us.
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.900]   Anybody who's different.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.860]   Racism doesn't have to be about color.
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.940]   You can be a racist about people, the way they look.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.580]   Or certain type of personalities.
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.060]   Or certain culture or family background.
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:17.180]   See, the sin that he's referring to, he says if you break that law, you become a lawbreaker
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:22.580]   and you are just as guilty as somebody who did something else.
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:31.700]   If you try to gain life through righteousness, if you break even one of it, you're guilty.
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:32.700]   That's what he's saying.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.980]   That's why, again, in Galatians 3.10 it says, "For all who rely on the works of the law
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.740]   are under a curse.
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.580]   For it is written, 'Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.340]   book of the law and do them.'"
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:54.620]   People who are relying on the law typically have two wrong applications.
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.080]   If you're relying on the law, there's two wrong applications.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:09.140]   One is, you're living with unwarranted, unmerited confidence.
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.220]   Because you've evangelized.
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.860]   You've done some work.
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.500]   You've sacrificed.
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.260]   You're serving in the church.
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:22.200]   And there's a sense of pride that comes in if you are, again, you may not confess it,
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.540]   you may not believe it.
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:28.440]   But this righteousness of the law, the way that it is applied falsely is it gives you
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.320]   false sense of pride.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.320]   I've achieved something.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.320]   I've done something.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.320]   I've sacrificed.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.720]   I've studied the Bible.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.840]   I know my theology.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.400]   I read a lot of books.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:45.520]   Suddenly, just like remember we talked about the health and wealth gospel?
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.780]   We don't believe it.
[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.880]   I don't think anybody here believes that.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.680]   But we practice it.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:57.400]   If God blesses us and gives us a good job or our stocks go up or we get a promotion,
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.280]   like God blessed me.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.280]   Isn't that health and wealth gospel?
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.400]   Isn't that what health and gospel teaches?
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.400]   That if God blesses you, you're going to have a health, wealth, and long life?
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:12.000]   So we don't believe that, but every single one of us practices it.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.760]   See this salvation by works, this righteousness that comes from doing good, we don't believe
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.760]   that.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.160]   We don't believe that, but it gives us a false sense of pride.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:31.000]   The other extreme, those who live by salvation or righteousness by works, is you get a false
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.280]   sense of despair.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.720]   I can never do it.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.360]   I'm always struggling.
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.000]   I'm not like that person.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.840]   Those people always seem to be doing right, and I just can't do it.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.800]   You just kind of separate yourself from the church, and I can't fellowship, and I can't
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:54.280]   serve, and I can't lead, and I don't have a testimony, and it's a false sense of humility,
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:16:02.040]   but at the core of that false sense of humility is works-based righteousness.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:10.960]   See, what Paul is saying is if you are seeking righteousness by your works, if you want to
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.920]   live by them, you have to keep it perfectly.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.680]   Remember the rich young ruler?
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.800]   In Mark chapter 10, he comes to Jesus, like, "How can I inherit eternal life?"
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.560]   And Jesus says, "Obey all the commandments."
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:28.560]   And the arrogance of this young man, he says, "I did."
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.360]   We know for a fact that he didn't do all of it.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:37.400]   There's nobody who is sinless, and yet this man, he probably worked very, very hard in
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.060]   obeying the law, and he says, "I did."
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:44.480]   And then Jesus says, knowing that he is rich, knowing that he, this is one thing that is
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.760]   precious to him that he cannot and will not give up, Jesus says, "Then sell all your possessions,
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.320]   give it to the poor, and follow me."
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:57.200]   Jesus tells him that, not as a way of instruction that if you did this, you will be saved.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.680]   He says he knew he couldn't do it.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.240]   Knowing that he was rich and knowing that he couldn't do it, Jesus puts that obstacle
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.220]   in front of him for what purpose?
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:13.200]   To tell him, "If you think the way of righteousness is by obeying the law, then do all of it.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.520]   He looked at all of it, and he couldn't do it.
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.800]   Even if he did do it, was Jesus saying, "Okay, if you did do it, you're going to get saved."
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.700]   Of course, that's not what he was saying.
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.400]   That's why the disciples are disturbed.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.960]   If this man who obeyed all of the commandments, simply because he couldn't give up all of
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:35.400]   his possessions, if he can't be saved, what about us fishermen who have foul mouths?
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.020]   We lived all our lives breaking the law.
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.020]   What about us?
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.020]   Remember what Jesus says?
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:46.060]   "What is impossible for man, God will do."
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:50.980]   Was Jesus saying that God's going to make every single one of them perfectly moral?
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:55.260]   Was Jesus saying that God was going to make every single person who followed him hate
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:00.140]   money and that you were just going to automatically, if you just follow him, going to be a perfect
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.820]   obedience to the law?
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:06.460]   Is that what he was saying when he says, "What is impossible for man, God will do"?
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.980]   No.
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:13.260]   What is impossible for man to do by his own work, what he cannot achieve, what was he
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.260]   saying?
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.020]   He said he would do.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.220]   He would do.
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:27.220]   And then he was going to, by his works, going to offer up himself as a replacement.
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:31.260]   See the Jews already knew.
[00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:36.860]   The Jews already knew that they would never be able to keep the law perfectly.
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:42.540]   In Deuteronomy 27, 26, after giving the law of God the second time, it says, "Cursed
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.820]   be anyone who does not confirm the words of the law by doing them, and all the people
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.460]   shall say, 'Amen.'"
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:54.020]   And so the whole congregation of Israel, after saying, "If you do not obey this, curse be
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:58.800]   upon all of us," and they all said, "Amen."
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:04.460]   Not knowing that that "Amen" was inviting condemnation and curse upon them.
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.900]   In fact, they were not delusional.
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:13.620]   Psalm 133, the psalmist says, "If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.140]   could stand?
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:21.220]   If Lord, if you were to judge us based upon our righteousness, who would be able to stand
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.700]   before you and claim righteousness?"
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:28.520]   Psalm 143, verse 2, "Enter not into the judgment with your servants, for no one living
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.900]   is righteous before you."
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:37.820]   We may be righteous in our eyes compared to other people, but who among us can be measured
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.700]   by your righteousness?
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.820]   So they weren't naive.
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.540]   They knew.
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:47.140]   They knew that they wouldn't be able to keep the law.
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:51.100]   But their problem was, they were comparing, not before God.
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.340]   They weren't standing before God.
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.340]   They were standing among each other.
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.900]   They were comparing themselves with the idol worshippers or the Gentiles, with the tax
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.900]   collectors.
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.140]   Instead of looking up, they were looking at each other.
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:08.380]   I mean, think about, think about us.
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:14.780]   What causes us to be complacent when we stand before this holy, holy, holy God?
[00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:22.700]   What causes you to sit here this morning feeling somewhat decent about yourselves?
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.980]   Or maybe you're beating yourselves up.
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:31.820]   What measure of standard caused you to feel that way?
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:36.180]   Typically it's because we measure ourselves with ourselves.
[00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:40.060]   No one standing before God would have the audacity to say, "I am holy before God."
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.060]   No one would say that.
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:46.540]   But we feel safe because we measure ourselves with ourselves, with the people sitting next
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:47.540]   to us.
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:52.100]   And there's always people around us who are worse off than we are.
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:56.980]   Or we feel really guilty and really down, not because we've broken God's commandment,
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.260]   but because compared to what other people are doing, I'm not living up.
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:06.580]   See the Jews, they were measuring themselves with themselves, with others.
[00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:11.380]   And the Pharisees were absolutely confident that they were better.
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:18.540]   See when he says, "Moses introduced this commandment, and by them you shall live."
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:24.140]   The only person that ever fulfilled that commandment completely and is able to say, "Amen," was
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:29.860]   Christ and Christ alone.
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:33.740]   He says in 1 Peter 3, 18, "For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.660]   the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.700]   made alive in the Spirit."
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.660]   Christ and Christ alone can claim that before God.
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:50.660]   I remember years ago when I first got married, I wasn't a good driver.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.100]   And I debated whether I should share this with you or not.
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:58.180]   Those who have known me for a long time, you already know that I don't have a good driving
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.420]   record.
[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:05.020]   I haven't gotten a ticket probably in the last, well, not, I got one.
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.060]   I got maybe one ticket in the last 15 years.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:15.820]   But until I was about 30, you know, 33 to 34, I lived in fear because I was getting
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:16.820]   targeted.
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.420]   None of it was my fault, of course.
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:26.780]   But there was a point when I got married, I got three tickets in three weeks.
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:28.980]   Yeah, so it wasn't my fault.
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.940]   None of it my fault.
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:31.940]   None of it was speeding.
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.180]   It was just kind of carelessness.
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:37.260]   I didn't completely stop on the stop sign or made a left turn too fast or, you know,
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.260]   something.
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.540]   I don't even remember what it was.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:43.900]   But after getting pulled over three times, you know, like, "What is going on?"
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.780]   You know, "Is there like a, you know, target in the back?
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.740]   Are they trying to deliberately find a, 'Hey, hey, he left this house.
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:50.740]   Go follow him.'"
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.740]   You know?
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.840]   So I was kind of doing my best to drive carefully.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.900]   And then for our honeymoon, we drove off to San Francisco to Lake Tahoe, and I was driving
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.020]   back from Lake Tahoe to back home.
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.540]   And those of you who've ever made that drive, basically, it's mostly downhill.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.220]   So it's very hard to drive speed limit.
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.220]   Okay?
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:13.180]   So I was coming down, and I got a ticket.
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:17.820]   And so because I got the ticket, this is right when we got married, that I lost my driver's
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.500]   license for a year.
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.500]   Okay?
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.180]   I'm not proud of it, but that's what happened.
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.760]   I lost my driver's license.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.900]   So I was a youth pastor at Irvine Baptist, and I couldn't drive.
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.980]   So I remember, you know, Joe, he was just starting to drive at that time.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:35.580]   So we taught him how to drive, so he would come and pick me up.
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.660]   You know, he was a youth student, and he was picking me up.
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.420]   Or there was a bus that would go down Juana, and I would get in, test it, and drop me off
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.840]   right in front of church.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.460]   And so I couldn't drive for a whole year.
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.460]   Right?
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:52.460]   Well, this one day, Esther was at work, and I was at home, and it was raining like cats
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.900]   and dogs.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.440]   And there was nothing to eat at home.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.940]   So I tried scrounging everything, and it was raining so hard.
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.340]   And I said, "Well, you know what?
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:04.220]   Maybe I'll just drive across the street to get something to eat."
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.220]   Right?
[00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.380]   All right, you guys are already losing respect already.
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:08.380]   All right.
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:12.860]   So I decided to get in the car, just drive across the street.
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.580]   So I said, "What's going to happen?"
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.940]   You know, literally, it's just from here to there.
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.240]   But it was raining so hard, I said, "Okay, I'm just going to drive across the street."
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:26.020]   So I got in my car, and those guys who, like Red Hill, on near, not Red Hill, Newport and
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:30.500]   Juana, it was raining so hard, and I was about to make a left turn, and it was raining so
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.780]   hard I couldn't see the road.
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.380]   And there was nobody on the road.
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.660]   And I turned into the parking lot.
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.660]   As soon as I turned into the parking lot, I see the red light going off.
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.780]   I said, "Oh, my gosh."
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.520]   I was literally in the car for like three minutes.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.420]   And I got pulled over, and I said, "What did I do wrong?
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.780]   I just, I literally just crossed the street."
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.360]   And he said, "You crossed the double yellow line."
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.360]   I'm like, "Oh, my gosh."
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.320]   I said, "It's raining."
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.320]   You know?
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.120]   And so he asked me to give my license, and I gave it to him, and then he did the background
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:04.600]   check, and he said, "Yeah, you crossed the double yellow line."
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.160]   So I remember thinking, "Wow.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.440]   Like you're going to give me a ticket for crossing a double yellow line in this rain?
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.760]   Like I, can you see the road?"
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.640]   I said, "I can't see the road."
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.880]   And I thought, I was like, "How, you know, this is unfair."
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:22.860]   And then he looked at me, he said, "Son, your license is suspended.
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.320]   I should take your car into the garage."
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:29.000]   It's like, "I'm being gracious to you.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.480]   I'm going to let you go, and you're going to get this ticket."
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.480]   And it was an $800 ticket.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:38.040]   He said, "I'm going to give you this ticket, but I'm not going to tow your car."
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.920]   And I remember as soon as he said that, I went from, "How can you give me a ticket
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.920]   to, thank you, Jesus."
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:52.440]   As soon as he pointed out, "How can you possibly argue with me about me giving you
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:53.440]   a ticket?
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.880]   Your license is suspended."
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:03.280]   How much of our righteousness that we feel, righteous indignation, or righteous pride,
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:08.360]   or even self-condemnation, whatever it may be, even the thought of thinking that somehow
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:13.960]   we're going to argue our righteousness before God.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.520]   Simply forgetting.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:22.640]   All who break the law are under a curse.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.800]   Because we forget that.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:31.140]   And when we forget that, we don't realize just how desperately we need Christ.
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:36.920]   That it is only by the grace that you are here, that you're able to understand, that
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:41.120]   you're able to sing songs, that you even have fellowship with your brothers and sisters.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.760]   Why you even have a copy of the Bible is simply by the grace of God.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:49.040]   How can we dare come before God and say, "Why?
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.920]   Why are you doing this to me?"
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.600]   See, salvation by works requires absolute submission.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:02.720]   Letter B, salvation by faith, on the other hand, must first acknowledge our inability
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.360]   to come to Christ.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.000]   He says in verse 6, "But the righteousness based on faith says, 'Do not say in your
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.080]   heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'"
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.360]   That is to bring Christ down.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.480]   "Or, 'Who will descend into the abyss?'"
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.160]   That is to bring Christ up from the dead.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.600]   What does he mean by that?
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:27.160]   Paul basically is presenting a ridiculous argument because he just said, "If Christ
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:32.680]   is the end of the law, if Christ is the end of the law, then where do I go?
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.880]   How do I get him?"
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.920]   He says the first thing that he says is what he should not say.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:43.920]   And he should not say, "If salvation is by grace, that I must ascend to heaven to
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.600]   bring him down to me."
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:51.360]   Imagine the ridiculousness of that argument.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:57.160]   By nature of grace, you cannot and you do not deserve it.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.560]   How many people fall away from the grace of God because they don't think they deserve
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.560]   the grace of God?
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:09.720]   I don't know how many times I sit in council and talk to people, this church or other churches
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.360]   that I'm at, I'm sitting down talking and saying, "I don't deserve the grace of God.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.000]   I don't deserve it."
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.720]   Well the very nature of grace means you don't deserve it.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.240]   That's what grace is.
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.440]   So if you say you don't deserve the love of God, you're absolutely correct.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:32.240]   Because the very beginning of our walk with God begins with you and I recognizing that
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.760]   you and I do not deserve the love of God.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.640]   You and I do not deserve the grace of God.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.640]   And yet he loved us anyway.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:43.320]   You and I don't deserve the grace of God and yet he gave us grace anyway.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:49.060]   That's what he means that let's do not say that I will have to climb up to God and somehow
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.060]   bring him down.
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.620]   Imagine that, the ridiculousness of that argument.
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:57.560]   You cannot earn your grace.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.600]   You can't give enough.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.440]   You can't pray enough.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.640]   You can't work enough.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.360]   You can't sacrifice enough.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.080]   You can't memorize enough scripture.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.600]   You cannot.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.880]   You can't climb this ladder and bring him down.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.080]   Imagine the ridiculousness of that argument.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.440]   That somehow something that we did or something that we need to do to somehow bring Christ
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.280]   down to us.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:26.360]   He says, "The first thing is to recognize that we cannot."
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:35.320]   I remember as a young Christian and somebody gave me the worst, in my opinion, one of the
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.880]   worst theologies.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.720]   And I lived with that for years.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:45.160]   And the illustration that he gave was the grace of God threw the rope down.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:50.840]   God opened up heaven and he threw the rope down and by his grace he said, "Climb that."
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.020]   And that's what grace is.
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:57.440]   But before you didn't have a rope and now you have a rope.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.840]   And so now you have to climb this rope.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.960]   You got to pray hard.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.960]   You have to give.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.020]   You have to sacrifice.
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.680]   And so I did.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.680]   Prayer meetings, evangelism.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.320]   And I said, "Yeah, I got to pray hard."
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.440]   And again, I had zeal.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.480]   I had passion.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:26.520]   After what, 33, almost going on 34 years as a Christian, I'm nowhere near climbing up
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.880]   this ladder than I did when I first started.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:36.020]   The only difference now and then was this rope was much further away than I thought
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:37.700]   it was.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.860]   And I was a lot weaker than I thought I was when I first started.
[00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:48.200]   When I first started, I thought, "Yes, Lord, I'm going to change the world for you.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.320]   I'm going to change the world for you.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.680]   I'm going to tell all the people, everybody who doesn't know you, I'm going to tell them,
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.640]   I'm going to travel to strange places."
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:01.040]   And then I remember when early on I used to think to myself, "I'm going to die early.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:05.240]   I'm going to live hard and I'm going to do hard things and I'm going to preach the gospel
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.860]   and I'm going to go to difficult places.
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:10.400]   And I'm going to die in glory.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.740]   I don't need to live here a long period of time.
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:16.300]   Just do my work and be in heaven."
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:22.580]   But after all these years, I realized, if there's anything that I realized, just how
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:30.060]   far God was and just how weak I am.
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:34.700]   He said, "Salvation by grace," first says, "do not say, 'Who's going to go up to heaven
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:42.400]   and bring him down or is going to go to the abyss and raise him up?'"
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.600]   How can you possibly?
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:50.160]   What is it that you have to offer to God that God will look down upon us and say, "You know
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.160]   what?
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.160]   That person's worth saving.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:59.880]   So now I'm going to get off the throne and humiliate myself and allow them to stone and
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.320]   kill me."
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:08.920]   And he's looking for somebody precious enough to do that for.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:14.660]   Imagine the ridiculousness of that argument that he saw something in you, he saw something
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:18.080]   in me.
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:22.060]   The only reason that scripture gives us of why he did what he did was because you and
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.140]   I needed it and he loved us.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.640]   And that's the mystery.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.640]   That's the mystery.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:29.640]   It's not because you had potential.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:34.120]   It's not because you're more disciplined or there's something more precious about you
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.680]   than the other person down the street.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:42.760]   It simply says you needed it and he loved us.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.600]   And that's the mystery.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.720]   Hell to me is not a mystery.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.840]   Hell is not a mystery.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:57.480]   I mean, you see something ugly, you know, I personally hate rats.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:02.200]   I think rats were a creation of the fall.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.680]   I don't know if that existed in the Garden of Eden.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.680]   I hate rats.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:15.640]   If I even think a rat is in my neighborhood, it makes me uncomfortable.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:20.800]   There's a place, you know, I understand hell.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:25.680]   I've been angry enough and I think there are certain people in the world that the terrorists
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.520]   and the Nazis did.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.680]   I mean, I could think of people.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.000]   I could think of situations where like, good, there's hell.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.480]   I can understand why a holy God would create hell.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.880]   Hell I understand.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.520]   Heaven I don't get.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.520]   Like why?
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:48.840]   There is no rational reason that justifies in my mind why the Son of God would go through
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.520]   what he did for me.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:55.720]   Why he who knew no sin became sin so that you and I might have the righteousness of
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.200]   God.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.600]   Explain that to me.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.680]   To the best of your ability, explain that to me.
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.520]   Why he would do that?
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.200]   Other than he loved me.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.320]   But why did he love you?
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.880]   Why did he love me?
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.080]   That's a mystery that I'm going to carry.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.920]   You know, I remember when I was younger, I used to think, oh, when you get to heaven,
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:19.680]   you know, what question are you going to ask God?
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.840]   I have a lot of questions.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:24.360]   You know, one of the questions I have is about creation and the other question that I always
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.920]   have is about Andrew.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.760]   What happened to Andrew?
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.640]   He introduces everybody to Jesus and then he's not part of the inner three.
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.640]   What did you do, Andrew?
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:37.640]   I'm curious.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.640]   He talked too much.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:42.120]   I don't know what he did, but he wasn't invited into the inner circle.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.360]   No matter how much I try to dig the scriptures and find out, there's nothing there.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:51.640]   It just says he introduced them and then he's just on the side the whole time.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.400]   That's one of the questions I'm going to ask.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:35:02.260]   But really the biggest mystery when I get to heaven is why?
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:06.040]   He knows every single one of my sins.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:10.800]   And it's not even before I met Christ.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.800]   It's after I met Christ.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.440]   And it wasn't before I became a pastor.
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.320]   It was after I became a pastor.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:22.640]   He knows every one of my sins better than I do.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.840]   Why would you save me?
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:32.200]   Why would you get off your throne and humiliate yourself and go through that and persevere
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:38.640]   not just with me, but a billion times over?
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.800]   It's a mystery that I will never understand.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.320]   That's why he says.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:50.880]   He says if salvation is by grace, he says, then what becomes of boasting in Romans 3
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.880]   27?
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:56.120]   And he simply says it is excluded.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:36:00.000]   It is excluded.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.920]   Boasting and Christianity is a contradiction.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:11.520]   Like pride and the gospel, it's a contradiction.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.200]   You know what causes church breakups?
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.720]   Pride.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:16.720]   People get into argument.
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:17.720]   They don't want to lose.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.360]   They think they're right and other people are wrong.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.800]   That's what breaks up the church.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.480]   What breaks up relationships?
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.440]   Pride.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.200]   What breaks up marriages?
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.840]   Pride.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.440]   Why is it so difficult to maintain relationship with people?
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.440]   It's because of pride.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.000]   Because I think I'm right and I think you're wrong.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:43.720]   I'm not saying that there isn't room for discussion and argument, but the core why it would lead
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:47.200]   to destruction ultimately is pride.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.840]   It's pride is at the core of all of man.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:55.040]   Wanting to have what God has and trying to lift ourselves up.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.480]   When Christ says it is that very thing that you're trying to do in life which is causing
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.560]   the curse to come.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.400]   Trying to be somebody when he said no.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.040]   He wants to live must first die.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:12.560]   He who loses his life for my sake, he shall live.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.840]   That's exactly what Christ did.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:19.000]   He lived the perfect life and he gave it up so that you and I could live.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.640]   He calls us to follow him and do the same so that we may continue to live.
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.920]   I'm going to wrap up for us this morning.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.080]   See Paul, he never had confidence.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:37.400]   Even as an apostle who planted all of these churches in Acts 20, 24, he says, "But I do
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:44.960]   not account my life of any value nor of precious to myself if only I may finish the course."
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.760]   Does that sound like an arrogant person?
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.840]   He says, "I count my life as nothing but I may finish the course."
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:55.360]   Paul, he's like, "I'm going to finish the course because you know how many churches
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.360]   I planted?
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.520]   I'm an apostle of Jesus Christ."
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:06.040]   He says, "It counts to me as nothing that I may hold on to the grace of God."
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:12.440]   Philippians 1.20, "As it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed."
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.080]   He says he knows that death is coming.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.360]   Maybe not this time, but maybe next time.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:22.280]   But he's eager expectation, he said, "Pray for me so that I would have courage to magnify
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:28.200]   Christ even when death comes."
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.040]   Paul's not arrogant.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.840]   He knows his own flesh.
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:37.160]   That's why Paul says 1 Corinthians 9.27 through that passage, "I buff in my body, making
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.160]   my slave."
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.640]   That's possibly after I have preached others that I may be disqualified.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:46.400]   "That he may hold on to the grace of God for dear life because it is not him, it is
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.040]   by his grace and by his grace alone."
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:57.000]   Third and finally, salvation by faith requires belief and confession of the complete work
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.520]   of Christ.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.520]   What does it say?
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.560]   If you can't go up to bring him down, if you can't go down to bring him up, what does
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.560]   it say?
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:07.640]   "The word is near you in your mouth and in your heart, that is the word of faith that
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:08.640]   we proclaim."
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:18.840]   As simple and as foolish as that may sound, well, what do we need to do then?
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:19.840]   What do we need to do?
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.800]   He says, "No, God did not require you to climb up.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.640]   God did not require you to go down."
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.520]   He says, "The word of faith is near you.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:27.600]   It's in your mouth."
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.520]   And then, we're not going to talk about it today, but next week, he says, "If you confess
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:35.760]   with your mouth that Christ is Lord," he was raised from the dead, he said, "you shall
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.760]   be saved."
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.760]   Really?
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.760]   That's it?
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:44.720]   That all these years that we've been trying to keep the law and keep the Sabbath and giving
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:48.920]   and proselytizing, he said, "All of that is nullified and all that we need to do is to
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:49.920]   confess."
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:54.200]   Yes, that's what Jesus says.
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:40:01.280]   In the book of John, chapter 6, 27-30, there's a bunch of people coming to Jesus, and Jesus
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.640]   said, "You're not coming to me because you saw signs.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.200]   You're coming to me because you ate and you want more."
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:11.400]   And he gives them this instruction, "Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:16.440]   the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you, for on him
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.320]   God the Father has set his seal."
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:22.760]   Then they said to him, "What must we do to be doing the works of God?"
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:30.480]   Jesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent."
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:37.840]   If we want to labor for things that are eternal, not temporary things, what should we do?
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.880]   Our immediate thinking is, "Well, get organized.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.200]   Plant churches.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.200]   Let's go do these things.
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:46.200]   Feed the poor."
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:51.480]   Now, all of these things are things, these are imperatives in Scripture that tell us
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.720]   what to do, but he says, "But what do we do?"
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:59.880]   He said, "First, the most important thing," he says, "is to believe."
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:05.080]   Now, superficially, we may sit here and think, "Well, that's it.
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.000]   I've already done it.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   I already believe it.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.240]   I already confessed it, so it's done."
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:19.560]   But do you know how often Jesus pointed out the lack of faith in his disciples?
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:25.160]   When they couldn't cast out demons, he didn't say, "Hey, you lack technique.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:29.720]   Instead of putting hands on the head, put it on the back."
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:34.360]   Instead of speaking Greek, speak Aramaic, because God loves Aramaic better.
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.800]   He doesn't give them instruction.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.800]   He says, "You," what?
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.040]   "Lack of faith.
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.360]   It's because you don't have enough faith."
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:45.560]   He said, before he fed the 5,000, he said, "All these people here, and they have nothing
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:46.560]   to eat."
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.680]   He said, "You didn't think this through?
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.440]   We're so far away.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.440]   You didn't think this?
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.440]   You didn't plan all these thousands of people here?"
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.440]   He didn't say that.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:00.600]   He says, "You lack of faith.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.920]   How long have I been with you?"
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:06.200]   When they were on the boat, and the storm was coming, and they were afraid that they
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.000]   were going to sink, Jesus wakes up.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.320]   He said, "Jesus, wake up.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.720]   Do you not care that we're going to die?"
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:11.720]   He wakes up, but he doesn't.
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.400]   He said, "Hey, hey, hey, wait a second.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:14.880]   You guys are professional fishermen.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.600]   You know we're going to be over there in a minute."
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:17.600]   He doesn't say any of that.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:23.640]   He says, "You lack of faith.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:34.520]   How much of our complacency is directly linked to unbelief?
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:41.880]   How much of our concerns for the future is because we don't believe?
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:50.840]   How much of our lack of desire to read the Word of God is because of unbelief?"
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:57.320]   If you really sit down and think about it, isn't it unbelief that we don't pray?
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:01.040]   Isn't it unbelief that we don't evangelize?
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:06.340]   Isn't it unbelief that we are complacent?
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:12.440]   He said the first and the most important thing that God calls us to do is to believe.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.960]   It is not up in heaven.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.560]   It is not down low.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:21.800]   He's already come.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.040]   He's already been crucified.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:27.920]   He's already been raised from the dead.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:31.440]   But do you believe?
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:37.680]   And I want to leave you with that and for you to really meditate and think about throughout
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.040]   this week.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:47.320]   Superficially, I meet people all the time who reject Christ and they say, "I don't
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.320]   believe."
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.560]   But when I sit down and talk to them, I say, "Oh, I'm an atheist."
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.080]   And then when you sit down and talk to them about the different arguments and why atheism
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:57.640]   doesn't make sense, and at the end of the argument, they say, "They really haven't
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.300]   thought it through."
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:05.860]   So they realize that their belief of atheism or anti-belief of Christianity was a prejudice.
[00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:09.600]   And so I found that through all these years of talking to atheists, it's not really
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:13.640]   that hard to have conversations with an atheist because the majority of the people haven't
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.440]   really thought it through.
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:19.560]   They haven't really read through and know what the argument is and decided.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:25.240]   It's just, you know, I met a bunch of Christians who are jerks.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.600]   And they're all judgmental, therefore, they're all this way.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:32.320]   But if they're willing to have an honest, intelligent conversation, I found that so
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:38.000]   much of rejection of Christ is not based on anything.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.320]   It's just prejudice.
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:46.960]   But then I also meet a bunch of Christians or confessing Christians who also say that
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.520]   they believe.
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:53.440]   So unbelief is superficial, but then I meet people all the time who say that they believe
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:57.880]   when you sit down and ask them, "What do you believe and why you believe it?"
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.200]   They can't argue it either.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:08.320]   So just as people reject Christ out of prejudice, a lot of people say they believe superficially
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.680]   without really believing either.
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:19.560]   So the most important work of salvation by grace alone is to test and see if you are
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:22.960]   really of the faith.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.320]   Do you believe?
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:29.080]   The question is not, "Did you read the Bible?
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:31.160]   Are you willing to serve the church?
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.160]   Did you give?"
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:41.840]   If you have no heart to meet with God, the Word of God just sounds like words.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:45.920]   Prayer just sounds like empty meditation.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:47.520]   Evangelism is just burdensome.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:53.000]   To tell people that if they don't believe in Jesus that there's judgment waiting for
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.480]   them is just inconvenient.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:01.000]   Could that be faith?
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:08.840]   How much of what you and I experience in life really is unbelief?
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:17.560]   So my encouragement and challenge to us before we make plans to do more things is to think
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:21.800]   carefully and seriously.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:22.800]   Do you believe?
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.960]   It is not far.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.960]   He is near.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.240]   But do you believe?
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:36.040]   Let's take some time to pray.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:43.020]   As we come before the Lord, again in prayer I want to encourage you.
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:50.440]   You can live the rest of your life just kind of filing away certain things that you hear.
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:54.220]   But I guarantee at some point it will resurface.
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:47:00.680]   When life gets hard and your heart becomes so numb that you don't care and you're okay
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.800]   with that.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.220]   But it will resurface.
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:12.240]   At some point in your life, if you don't believe, it will resurface.
[00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:17.120]   So my encouragement to all of us as we come to the Lord in prayer, that whatever it is
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:22.760]   that you have before God, whatever it is that you are doing or not doing, to be sincere
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.760]   about it.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.560]   You're not just running this race and one day you're going to wake up and say, "How
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.800]   did I get here?"
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:38.320]   To ask meaningful, serious, life-changing questions.
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:39.320]   Do I really believe?
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:42.600]   And if I do, what does that mean?
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:46.160]   take some time to pray as our worship.
