[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400]   Let's bring him out.
[00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.800]   Jimmy Donaldson, Mr. Beast.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.280]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.740]   What's up, brother?
[00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.240]   How's it going?
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.240]   What's up, everybody?
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.720]   [MUSIC - "I'M GOING HOME"]
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.600]   Let your winners ride.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.840]   Rain Man, David Sack--
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.800]   I'm going home.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.520]   And it said--
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.440]   We open sourced it to the fans, and they've
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.480]   just gone crazy with it.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.280]   Love you, Wesley.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.760]   Ice Queen of Quinoa.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.240]   I'm going all in.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.720]   So--
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.720]   Look at the phone.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.800]   Wow.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.720]   Wow.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.840]   Guys, no selfies.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.440]   No selfies.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.520]   I mean, everybody's sending it to their kids as we speak.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.160]   Do your fans have like a name, like Beasties or something?
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.160]   No.
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.660]   Beasties?
[00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.160]   Besties?
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.660]   Besties?
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.400]   Besties?
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.760]   That's Taylor Swift.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.200]   Beasties is pretty good.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.480]   So I think everybody, all of you guys know Jimmy.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.080]   But let me just tell you the quick story.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.640]   I hate when people describe me in front of me, but go for it.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.720]   Jimmy started YouTubing when he was 13 years old.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.840]   And this is an incredible example.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.400]   I mean, Jimmy's basically an athlete.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.480]   So if you take a guy who basically spends
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.440]   10,000 hours at something, and there's a Steph Curry outcome,
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.960]   there's a LeBron James outcome, and there's a Jimmy Donaldson
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.460]   outcome.
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.120]   So what does this one look like?
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.240]   He starts posting videos online.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.680]   He starts iterating, iterating, iterating at 16.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.680]   I think he had like--
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.320]   I don't know, 2016 or so, he had like 30,000 followers,
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.600]   some nominal number.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.280]   Kept tweaking, putting in the thousands and thousands
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.880]   of hours, stumbled into college for two weeks, stumbled out.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.000]   And then fast forward now a decade since he started this,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.600]   he's basically the most followed human on Earth
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.600]   after Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.280]   Although in terms of content creation,
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.360]   he's basically the top two or three most followed people
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.200]   on YouTube, Twitter, TikTok--
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.840]   sorry, not Twitter.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.340]   X.
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.320]   X. Billions of views, event-based viewing.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.320]   So when he launches videos noon Eastern time on Saturdays
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.520]   every two weeks, if you're not watching them,
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.120]   probably people you know, definitely your kids,
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.920]   their friends, it's just a spectacle.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.200]   And so that's how you've become you.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.600]   So let's start at the beginning.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.440]   How did your mom react?
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.720]   Because Sue seems like--
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.040]   and she works for Jimmy.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.920]   She's like a head of compliance, OK?
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.400]   She just makes sure no one steals money.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.640]   It's a nice fun role.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.960]   So what happened when you showed up and you're like, hey, mom,
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.840]   I've been streaming secretly and I have these followers?
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.480]   Well, you know what's interesting, actually,
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.640]   is you should encourage your kids to have hobbies
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.680]   and want to do these things.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.600]   My mom thought it was crazy that I was talking
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.680]   to people on the internet.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.200]   So I ended up just lying, like, oh, it was a joke.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.480]   I just have a friend I'm talking to every night online
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.560]   or on Skype or whatever.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.120]   And then once I hit 10,000 subscribers, I told her,
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.040]   yeah, I was a lie.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.080]   I don't have any friends.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.200]   I'm just making videos.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.640]   And she just didn't understand it.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.040]   She was just like, what does this mean?
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.320]   Where did the idea for all these spectacles originate from?
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.080]   The first few that really broke through,
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.000]   how did you guys come up with them
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.320]   or how did you come up with them?
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.600]   Well, the thing is, for people, if you
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.120]   want to get hypothetically 100 million views on a video,
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.040]   the easiest way is to do something cool no one's
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.920]   done before.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.360]   And one of the first ones was I saw
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.000]   no one had ever counted 100,000 in a row.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.920]   So I was like, I'll just count 100,000.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.800]   I watched that video for about five minutes.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.480]   It's pretty great.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.400]   It's more than normal.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.640]   It's 40 hours long, but the retention's two minutes.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.240]   And you look like-- how old were you in that 15 years old?
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.000]   I was like 18.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.500]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.360]   It's hilarious.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.760]   So I just started because I didn't have money.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.240]   So I just started with--
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.560]   How many views does that have?
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.200]   I think that one's like 30 million.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.700]   Yeah.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.040]   Just me counting.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.000]   But it's funny because it's like, look at this idiot.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.120]   He counted to 100,000.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.000]   How much money has it made?
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.520]   That one?
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.640]   I don't know.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.200]   Ballpark.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.560]   What do you think?
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.400]   I mean, most videos probably have like $5 RPM, so 150 grand.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.040]   OK.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.200]   Great.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.560]   OK, so you launched this thing and then it starts to go.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.120]   And then how do you scale the ideas?
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.120]   Because it does become a bit of a hamster wheel.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.680]   Like, how do I one-up myself?
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.120]   And do you always feel this pressure
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.560]   to have to one-up yourself from the last video, literally?
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.760]   Well, essentially, obviously, I've just
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.020]   been doing this for 14 years.
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.720]   And also, you said 10,000 hours.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.840]   I think people should change that saying to 10,000 days.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.920]   And I'm almost at my halfway point to 10,000 days.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.880]   I think that's how people should start looking at things.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.520]   Because to be honest, 10,000 hours is pretty easy.
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.060]   What is that?
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.240]   Like 10 hours a day for three years?
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.040]   Just a random thing.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.320]   But yeah, just--
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.080]   I don't know.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.680]   We would get 100,000 views on a video, take the money,
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.560]   do another video, get 150,000.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.120]   And I've just kind of reinvested the money for 14 years.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.800]   And even to this day, whatever I make,
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.520]   I just spend it the next month on content.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.120]   And the videos have just progressively
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.480]   gotten bigger and bigger.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.480]   And it's gone from me counting to 100,000
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.800]   to seeing what happens if you put a Lamborghini
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.080]   on the world's largest shredder.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.040]   Just random things.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.040]   Well, you also seem to have some pretty good judgment, where
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.240]   maybe some of your contemporaries don't.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.480]   We've seen that need to get the next view
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.920]   lead to people doing increasingly dangerous stunts,
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.160]   like taking a Model X over some hill.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.160]   I think Dobrik did that.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.440]   Some other person was swinging somebody on a crane.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.760]   Maybe you could talk a little bit about restraint
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.320]   and understanding, like, hey, even though this
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.480]   is going to get a lot of views, and maybe some
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.160]   of your contemporaries--
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.960]   I won't give the specific names of people--
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.840]   but they've done some really idiotic things
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.600]   and gotten hurt.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.280]   So how do you know when a conversation and some
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.960]   of these ideas maybe go over the line?
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.800]   Well, the obvious answer is common sense.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.920]   Great, OK.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.480]   Next question.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.400]   No, no, no.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.720]   The thing is, obviously, there's a lot of things
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.280]   people do that they know will get views because of outrage.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.680]   And it's just easy to do.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.720]   But if you're trying to build a long-term brand,
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.560]   you don't want to just constantly piss people off
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.480]   just to get attention.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.720]   Eventually, it stops working.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.160]   So the real answer is you just got to not go,
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.080]   what is the easiest way to get views?
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.600]   What do people actually want to watch that isn't just
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.160]   going to get views because they're angry, essentially.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.160]   You have a few in Greenville, North Carolina.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.360]   You basically have your own college campus.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.400]   It's like buildings, lots, studios,
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.960]   all these young people dynamically running around,
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.840]   doing all this stuff.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.440]   I mean, when I saw it, I was like, this is a tech startup.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.880]   It felt like Facebook circa 2006,
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.040]   except it's in Greenville.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.520]   Why did you think you could pull this off there?
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.680]   Yeah, well, the thing is, as you scale up,
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.640]   you're not really--
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.080]   especially when you're in your young 20s,
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.080]   you're just kind of doing whatever
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.560]   you got to do to keep up with growing and making the videos.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.320]   So you just kind of blink, and 10 goes to 20 employees
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.440]   to 50 to 100.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.160]   How do you get people to go there?
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.280]   What is it that you're giving them
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.920]   where they would leave New York or LA
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.240]   and whatever their job is to try to do this with you?
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.400]   Yeah, that's the hard part.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.960]   I'm still trying to figure it out.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.440]   Most people, it's a lot of convincing, to be honest.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.120]   I would highly recommend you don't
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.000]   build a company in a middle-of-nowhere woods
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.880]   in North Carolina city like ours.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.080]   Most people don't want to live there.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.560]   So usually, it's just people who--
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.280]   their job is kind of their life, and they're
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.740]   very passionate about what they do.
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.640]   So it's like, we provide you a cool job,
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.480]   where one day you're going to bury me alive.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.600]   The next, you're going to figure out how to send me
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.000]   to space or whatever.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.200]   But the real answer is you just got
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.900]   to find people where work is their life,
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.860]   and so they don't care.
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.160]   But anyone who does, they hate it.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.640]   Well, that's actually a feature in some ways, right?
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.140]   Yeah.
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.360]   Which is how Silicon Valley used to work, by the way.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.120]   This is what I was going to say.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.360]   How do you recruit for that?
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.880]   And what do you do when you find out
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.120]   that there are people that want work-life balance
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.080]   and don't want to do the level--
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.500]   aren't willing to commit the way you're willing to commit?
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.920]   I mean, like I said, that's the part
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.440]   I'm still trying to figure out, to be 100% honest.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.080]   I think at some point, I just got
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.600]   to move out of the middle of nowhere in North Carolina.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.040]   Don't recommend it, building a big company in a small city.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.560]   How many employees do you have now?
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.960]   There, around 250.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.480]   So you consider maybe moving into Los Angeles or something
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.560]   to be closer to Hollywood?
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.960]   No, but just somewhere where it's a decent-sized city
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.960]   would probably be more optimal.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.600]   One that has an airport would be nice.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.560]   Sure.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.080]   One of the things you say a lot is
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.500]   I'm still trying to figure it out.
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.680]   I think that's the key to your success.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.240]   Having spoken to you a bunch, I get the sense
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.760]   that you're on this insatiable journey.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.560]   I mean, you speak in a very grandiose way
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.560]   about what you're trying to do.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.120]   There's no frigging limit.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.780]   You see it in your videos, but you also
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.960]   see it in how you've iterated.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.800]   I tell people, there's no one else on Earth,
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.200]   no entrepreneur in history, where
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.760]   you can go track them longitudinally
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.520]   from the first thing they did all the way through to today.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.920]   If you want to understand this entrepreneur,
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.760]   it's all in the open.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.360]   Go check it out.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.020]   And now you'll see the grind, and you'll
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.600]   see what it took to get here.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.520]   And it doesn't stop.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.160]   Every week, you've got some new record-breaking 24-hour video
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.320]   coming out, and it's fucking nuts.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.760]   What's the mission?
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.680]   Where's it all going?
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.080]   And help just frame for the audience, for everyone.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.840]   How do you think about where you're going?
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.560]   The beauty is there's--
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.360]   well, YouTube, that's my main platform.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.040]   Obviously, if you buy an Android phone,
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.980]   YouTube's pre-installed, and Alphabet owns it.
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.720]   So when you search things on Google,
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.340]   it takes you to YouTube a lot of times.
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.280]   So YouTube is just massive.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.440]   I mean, billions of people use it on a monthly basis.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.200]   And so being big on YouTube, we get 100 million views
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.000]   on a video in the first seven days, which
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.640]   before the last couple of years, that's
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.960]   never been possible in history.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.400]   So it's definitely a very interesting time
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.080]   where you can get just unfiltered access
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.880]   to basically unlimited people.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.120]   And then we just--
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.920]   weirdly enough, it's not why I got into it,
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.280]   but it ended up just working out that way,
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.360]   that I spent 14 years of my life just studying
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.800]   how to make the most optimal videos, what type of content
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.840]   people want, and we just kind of mastered
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.840]   the art of going viral.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.100]   And YouTube just so happens to be such a big platform.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.520]   And so it's pretty nice, because now, like they've been saying,
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.400]   we're getting around a billion views a month.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.400]   And yeah, we can just--
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.800]   Where do you want to take it?
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.680]   Well, recently, we started getting into selling--
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.480]   Long term, yeah.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:09.980]   Yeah.
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.480]   Well, we started getting into selling some CPG products.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.000]   So we started with chocolate.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.840]   And it's nice, because the same people who I would take
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.200]   pictures with in Walmart, when they see our product there,
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.820]   they're like, oh, it's the guy from YouTube, and they'll buy it.
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.600]   And so just kind of--
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.000]   right now, just anything in retail
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.280]   is great, because you just put things on a shelf,
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:28.960]   and people buy it.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:35.200]   And it's much easier than doing something complicated.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.560]   I tell people, it's almost as if you think your job is
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.440]   to make people happy.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.800]   Is that a good way to frame--
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.480]   Yeah, of course.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:40.980]   --your job?
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:41.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.640]   Yeah, because--
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.260]   The other thing that I find just extraordinary
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.160]   about your business is you're essentially
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.440]   built Walmart without any of the cost structure.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.760]   Any brand you decide to build will immediately
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.760]   have the first 10 million customers.
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.440]   Yeah, well, the beauty is we don't have--
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.840]   essentially, don't have to do marketing.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.340]   So yes.
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.080]   Zero marketing cost, but also zero distribution cost.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.480]   That can go one of two ways with the Mr. Beast Burger.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.040]   You learned a lot of lessons there.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.280]   Maybe went too fast.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.920]   You didn't expect it to be so popular,
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.520]   and you lost control of that.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.760]   And then with the Feastables stuff, you nailed it.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.800]   So maybe you could tell us the lessons from each
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.000]   of those projects.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.760]   Well, yeah, the beauty of Feastables is--
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.520]   I mean, kind of like I said, you just put it on a shelf,
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.160]   and people go there and buy it.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.280]   I mean, you want to ask me something more specific?
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:31.840]   I don't know.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.640]   No, but be honest--
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.320]   Mr. Beast Burger.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:33.820]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:34.480]   Hold on.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.760]   Be honest about the insane amount of product development
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.800]   work you personally do and how deeply you
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.240]   care about making it work.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.480]   I think that's what's missing for a lot of people.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.520]   Well, no, and then my point was Mr. Beast Burger,
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.080]   you kind of loaned your name to it,
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.240]   and it didn't have the same quality control.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.040]   That one I can't talk about, but--
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.920]   OK, no problem.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.440]   I was wondering.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.480]   No problem.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.920]   OK, let's just admit these last few questions were shitty.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.440]   Let's reset.
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.440]   No, I think it's a great question.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.600]   We just can't talk about it.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.840]   Let's bring it back to the--
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.080]   All right, let's go back to the two smarter people here
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.280]   at this level of stuff.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.640]   David, you have a question?
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.600]   I want to ask about--
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.080]   I better get onto a new topic here real quick.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.720]   The thing I've been really blown away by
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.440]   is just how elaborate your productions are.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.720]   I mean, some of these videos are incredibly
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.680]   elaborate in the production values and in the storytelling.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.040]   The one that comes to mind for me is the Squid Game series,
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.000]   which, I mean, that looked monumental logistically
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.120]   to pull off in terms of set design and every other way.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.680]   I mean, I guess tell us more about what goes into that.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.520]   And what I'm kind of hearing from you with the 250 people
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.800]   you have working, you've built this whole town,
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.240]   it sounds like the old studio system,
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.760]   like back in Hollywood, like Warner Brothers back
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.640]   in the 1930s, where they had their own lots, their own
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.920]   actors, their own everything.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.560]   And it was very different back then.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.080]   Like we heard Gwyneth saying that most of her time on a set
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.520]   is like waiting around.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.560]   It doesn't sound like that's what's going on with you.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.120]   So you're back to kind of the original studio system.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.080]   I mean, like I said, the beauty is
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.440]   we don't have a studio that tells us what we can or can't
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.600]   do, or the distribution or anything.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.640]   It's just we own it all.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.800]   So we just make whatever videos we think will be viral.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.520]   And obviously, we have the direct connection.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.880]   And so the big thing is like obviously, YouTube,
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.200]   at the moment, you don't make that much from ad revenue.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.240]   So to do these big multimillion dollar videos,
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.740]   it's just not really possible, which
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.840]   is why doing things like Feastables and other products
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.280]   to generate revenue on the back end
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.680]   is why we're able to do that and other people aren't.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.640]   Because it's like, even if you get 100 million views
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.240]   on a video, the RPM's $5.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.480]   It's only $500,000.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.280]   So it's not that crazy, which is why
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.080]   people aren't able to do these big budget spectacles
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.240]   like we are.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.240]   Because most people don't even get anywhere
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.440]   near that kind of viewership.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.680]   And so it's like the beauty is creating the model where
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.720]   we turn around and we use that to sell products,
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.320]   sell a couple hundred million of that a year,
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.560]   and then we use that to put it back into the content.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.280]   Is there pressure to tone down the consumerism
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.760]   or the giving away money?
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.240]   I'm sure there's a faction of people
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.560]   that either find that offensive or they
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.120]   think it's exploitative.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.800]   How do you deal with that?
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.360]   No, not really, to be honest.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.440]   Most people think it's cool because it's
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.240]   kind of fun to watch someone receive $10,000 or a Lamborghini
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.560]   or a house.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.800]   The last thing we did was I ordered pizza and tipped
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:27.480]   the guy a house.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.360]   And I thought it was cool.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.600]   Not bad.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.680]   I actually ordered two pizzas, one from Domino's
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.640]   and one from Pizza Hut.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.560]   And the guy who got there first got the house.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.040]   I mean, there was.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.440]   The Domino's guy got it.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.520]   So I ordered Domino's.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.480]   I think, no, but didn't you do something--
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.200]   it was curing blindness?
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:45.700]   Yes.
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.920]   Yeah, there was like 10 Karen's who got upset.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:48.840]   And people were like--
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.880]   There were people, right?
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.040]   Like 10 Karen's got upset.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.040]   And it was like, really?
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.480]   At the end of the day, as long as I
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.200]   think what I'm doing is good and helping people,
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.040]   obviously, at the scale of our views,
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.480]   that video got 200 million views.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.560]   Of course, some subsection is going to be mad.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.320]   It's just kind of at that number,
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.120]   it's just inevitable that people will be unhappy.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.800]   There's a piece of your business that actually many people
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.200]   probably don't know about outside the commercial part,
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.640]   which is Beats Philanthropy.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.960]   You want to tell people about the size of the food bank
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.600]   you've built and how that works?
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.520]   Sure.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.320]   So I just-- I feel we're talking about it myself,
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.560]   but we essentially just started a charity
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.880]   and then made a YouTube channel where
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.360]   whatever we do with the money from the charity, we film it.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.120]   So that generates revenue on the back end.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.000]   And obviously, those videos go on
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.680]   to raise a lot of money for donations.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.440]   And so it's just kind of a cycle where we upload a video a week
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.440]   and we were able to build a couple of food banks
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.200]   and feed a couple hundred thousand people,
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.000]   that kind of stuff.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.400]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:52.400]   You want to talk about the business model in the future?
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.360]   So you have basically this YouTube business.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.640]   And that goal is essentially just maximize growth.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.280]   Yeah, just make content people want
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.640]   and get as many views as possible.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.600]   And as J. Cal said, build distribution and direct it
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.880]   at these old legacy companies.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.560]   Are there things-- but you said you
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.480]   wanted to do things that were just like--
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.160]   it seemed less offline, right?
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.000]   So I'm sure you looked at online things.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.840]   I mean, right now, it's just like--
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.560]   the reason we started with chocolate is, obviously,
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.160]   in the last 50 years, there hasn't
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.120]   been any major chocolate company that has spawned up.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.840]   Like Hershey's, Limp, Mars, Farrar,
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.200]   they're all like 100 years old.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.920]   And so it's kind of just a sleepy space
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.240]   where they don't really innovate and it's kind of boring
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.440]   and no one really cares.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.660]   And so obviously, eventually, we'll
[00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.040]   do online because it's much easier
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.500]   to get people to download an app to buy a physical product.
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.000]   But it's just kind of perfect because the shelf space never
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.720]   changed and people want something new.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.120]   And so it was easy to take over.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.120]   How big is that business for you, can you say?
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.280]   This is our second year.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.880]   We'll do a couple hundred million.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.800]   Wow.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.300]   OK, wait.
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.720]   So we just guessed about the math here.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:02.360]   You said a billion views a month at $5 CPM.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.280]   So it's $5 million a month for the video,
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.800]   so $60 million a year.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.280]   And the chocolate bars will do $200?
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.120]   I mean, we're not really public about it,
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.400]   but it'll do a lot of revenue.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.360]   We'll figure it out.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.720]   They'll do something, more than a penny.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.080]   What do you think about the success of Prime?
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.200]   How do you look at that?
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   Yeah, they're killing it.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.440]   I mean, yeah, that's a great case study.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.080]   It's just--
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.880]   Because I heard you can build--
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.380]   You never--
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.720]   I heard two years ago you can--
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.440]   --billion revenue, right?
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.560]   Well, I don't know about that, or at least I
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.360]   can't say publicly.
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.680]   But I can say you never would have thought
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.520]   tens of millions of kids, or at least millions of kids,
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.600]   would be so enthusiastic about a sports stream.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.360]   It's crazy the kind of demand they've
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.240]   created, like kids literally collect Prime bottles,
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.080]   and then TikToks go viral showing off
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.560]   their collection of drink bottles that are like $3
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.080]   or whatever.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.040]   Raise your hand if you've got kids that do that.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.160]   Yeah, it's wild.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.560]   I mean, so Prime was great because obviously it's
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.480]   a beverage, and the more shelf space you get,
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.720]   just naturally the more sales.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.080]   But it was more a lifestyle brand
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.200]   they created where just kids felt cool drinking it,
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.200]   and to the point where they would buy a 12 pack for like $15
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.040]   and then sell them for like $6 a bottle at their school, which
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.080]   is like something that happens in almost every school
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:12.560]   in America.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.480]   It's crazy, still to this day after like a year and a half.
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.200]   One of the things that I think if you taste Prime that it has
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.880]   is a ton of sucralose, right?
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.840]   So it tastes super like bam, big mouth feel.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.040]   Where's your thinking on like the line between nutrition
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.200]   versus just tastes good for the products you have
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.760]   and the products you want to build,
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.160]   and where do you want to take that?
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:34.480]   Oh, great.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.640]   I think that's very important.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.960]   That's why our chocolate, we only use four ingredients,
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.240]   whereas Hershey's uses nine.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.720]   Because obviously, since we have this much influence,
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.160]   we don't want to just make people--
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.080]   whatever we sell needs to be better than what's
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:46.840]   currently on the shelf.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.120]   Or then it's just a net negative,
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:48.640]   you know what I mean?
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.880]   Better for you, higher quality ingredients, et cetera.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.480]   So yeah, I mean, in a nutshell, that's kind of how I view it.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.880]   And so what are these other areas
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.240]   then that just make maybe obvious sense,
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.640]   if you could snap your fingers and just--
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.640]   Yeah, well, I think the simplest thing--
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.800]   the more I've studied chocolate and see it--
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.360]   we started with-- well, funny enough,
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.000]   we started selling dark chocolate, which 65% of kids
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.080]   in America don't even like.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.960]   So that was kind of dumb, but I didn't know any better.
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.480]   So I mean, the simplest thing is do milk chocolate,
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.800]   which is what we're getting into,
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.840]   and then just going down and maximizing chocolate,
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.520]   doing Reese's cups and that kind of stuff.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.080]   So past chocolate, I haven't really thought about it,
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.960]   because that's basically all I'm thinking about for next year.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.040]   Do you think the candy business can be a billion dollar revenue
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:33.680]   business?
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.560]   Oh, yeah, of course.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.880]   I mean, look at Hershey's.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.800]   What are they doing, $12 billion a year, Mars, tens of billions?
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.200]   I mean, in America alone, I think
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:43.680]   people spend $25 billion a year on chocolate.
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.240]   And there's no one in those companies
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.640]   building a Mr. Beast competitor.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.160]   I mean--
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.080]   From a brand perspective.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.000]   There's no one in those companies
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:49.720]   that build the companies.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.840]   They're like 100 years old.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.280]   They're all dead.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.000]   But yeah.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.960]   How do you-- you must have a ton of inbound
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.120]   to do things outside of the Mr. Beast realm, Hollywood, et
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:02.880]   cetera.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.200]   How do you sort through all the inbound opportunities
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.520]   and then organize?
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.880]   Because you could, I would suspect,
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.680]   be drowning in opportunity at this point
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.920]   with this level of notoriety.
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.420]   Yeah.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.960]   Well, that's why we are where we are,
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.160]   is because we just laser-focus on one thing for essentially
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.040]   my entire life.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.480]   And so it's pretty easy.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.840]   I just say no.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:21.600]   Everything.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.680]   And then, yeah, because it's like, obviously,
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.400]   to make the videos of the caliber we need,
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.680]   it's just like, that's been my obsession for the last 14
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.520]   years, almost every waking hour of the day,
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.120]   just obsessing over every little thing.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.560]   Even simple things like when you click on a video,
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.100]   the brightness in the video matters.
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.680]   Like if it's a little too dark, people
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.800]   are more apt to click off and not watch it,
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.920]   because not everyone has their phone screen brightness turned
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:46.920]   up.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.280]   You did something with your mouth being open or closed
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.320]   in the thumbnail, and it changed click-throughs.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.360]   That was a new A/B test.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.360]   Well, the problem is whatever I do, a bunch of other people do,
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.480]   and I started opening my mouth in my thumbnails,
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.600]   and it's kind of annoying.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.480]   And then a bunch of other creators did it.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.520]   And I was like, OK, we're not doing this anymore.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.640]   So I switched them back.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.440]   What's the budget?
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:04.920]   So everyone else will switch them back.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.680]   What's the budget on each video now?
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.880]   So every two weeks, how much money goes into that video?
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.120]   I think right now it's around $2.5 million per video.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:12.600]   Oh, OK.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.480]   That's like making an independent film
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.240]   every two weeks.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.520]   But I mean, I don't think it's that crazy, though,
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.320]   because they're getting like 100 million views in seven days.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.480]   So if anything, any other medium outside of social media
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.900]   that got that kind of viewership,
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.200]   their budget would be like 50x.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.120]   Absolutely.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.520]   Do you think that you're building a library?
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.600]   Do you expect that the video that you created,
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.720]   the Olympic games thing you did a few weeks ago, in five years,
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.480]   that that'll still be--
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.080]   that'll have some value 15 years from now?
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.120]   Well, 15, I don't know.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:41.880]   But five, yes.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.840]   Usually, whenever we upload a piece of content,
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.040]   we'll get a couple million views a month.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.360]   As of right now, forever.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.480]   But obviously, eventually, it'll probably die off.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.040]   But they're usually pretty evergreen.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.760]   Because right now, because we have the model where
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.640]   we're making money outside of YouTube so I can spend more,
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.320]   it's like you have this video that's
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.920]   $2.5 million budget or another video that's $2.5,000 budget.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.920]   And so right now, usually people end up
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.520]   just clicking on the cooler stuff.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.880]   And then how do you think about just the axis of going
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.960]   outside the United States?
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.800]   So different languages, different countries.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.560]   How do you deal with that?
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.400]   That's the best part.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.140]   So as you know, we hired voice actors
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.720]   to dub our videos in every language.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.880]   And I assume a lot of you guys here are content creators.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.960]   And the crazy part is only 10% of the world speaks English.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.760]   So if your content's only in English,
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.800]   it's pretty hard to obviously reach most of the world.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.240]   Even subtitles, most people don't prefer it.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.960]   So if you dub your videos, hire voice actors or whatever,
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.360]   your viewership will skyrocket.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.760]   And so right now, over half the people that watch my videos
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.840]   don't even speak English, which is pretty crazy.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.200]   Tell me about the relationship with YouTube
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.800]   and how that's evolved over the years.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.360]   Because I don't know they anticipated
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:52.320]   that the footprint of the top creators on YouTube
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.160]   would get so large.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.880]   Are they deeply involved in communicating with you?
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.280]   Or are they just like, hey, we're a platform.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.520]   Post a video if you like it.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.800]   It's that.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.640]   That's extraordinary to me.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.560]   I mean, I kind of like it because then no one
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.600]   can say there's favoritism or they're helping us in any way.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.920]   But agreed, even when I was coming up,
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.760]   people were getting 10 million views a video.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.520]   And that was mind-blowing.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.120]   And their life cycle would be like a year, and they'd fall off.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.880]   So it's kind of crazy.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.640]   I don't really know how we ended up getting this big.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.180]   Was there ever a thought to tell them
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:25.280]   to make a higher minimum per RPM,
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.640]   and I'd like to cut a deal with you to hit these numbers
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.800]   and be treated differently?
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.760]   They'd be like, well, then everyone's going to want that.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.200]   Because if they do it with me, then
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.480]   they would open the floodgates.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.960]   They would just tell me, spend less money.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.460]   Got it.
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:37.920]   Interesting.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.120]   Because no one's forcing me to spend this much money.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.000]   It's kind of the problem.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.080]   Technically, most people don't spend hardly any money.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.640]   But there was a moment in time where
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.360]   Microsoft started stealing away some YouTubers and folks
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.840]   for their Twitch competitor.
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.400]   Did you get those kind of offers?
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.820]   And then how did you evaluate them?
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.320]   Well, the problem is, like I said at the start,
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.780]   YouTube's where all the viewers are.
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:01.000]   So it's like, sure, you can get a little bit of money.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.620]   But ultimately, the real game is if you
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:05.600]   can get a billion views a month for 10 years,
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.280]   whatever, the amount of brands we could build is insane.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:08.780]   Yeah.
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.120]   I mean, it is the great success of YouTube
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.840]   that they've hit this level of scale.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.340]   Exactly.
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.960]   And the features and stuff on that--
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.180]   YouTube is the only platform right now
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.420]   where you can upload a video in different languages.
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.440]   So if someone clicks my video in Mexico, I'll speak Spanish.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.720]   Whereas if you click it in America, I'll speak English.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.600]   That feature is in beta right now.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.100]   Yeah.
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.400]   Well, they rolled it out to other people.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.000]   But on TikTok, Facebook, no other platform can you do that.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.520]   So YouTube's the only place right now
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.440]   where you can actually have a global audience.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.980]   Do you provide the voiceover person?
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.280]   Or is that done automatically?
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.020]   Because they're working on an automatic version, I was told.
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.600]   For the first-- or the next two years,
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.480]   it'll probably sound terrible.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.920]   But of course, at some time in the near future,
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.320]   AI dubbing will--
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.680]   We get hit up about that all the time for the all-in-one.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.060]   Right now, I've trained a ton of different voice models.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.480]   And they sound terrible.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.520]   But it is obviously getting better very quickly.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.100]   Have you published any to see what the viewership looks like?
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.640]   AIME versus real voice actors?
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.140]   We have.
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.880]   And it's usually-- so if it's a one-minute video,
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.580]   and the retention with normal voice actors
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.360]   is 45 seconds, it'll be like 42.
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.040]   But it'll also be a lot of comments like,
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.340]   why does he sound slightly off?
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.580]   So the retention isn't as bad as you would think.
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.900]   But it's still like--
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.540]   You can tell the quality score's lower.
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.360]   The thing is, when you're using dubs,
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.500]   you're already at a disadvantage.
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.580]   Because they can choose to watch someone
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.240]   in their native language, or watch you
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.200]   with a guy speaking over your lips.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.120]   And so if it's not as good as--
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.920]   you're already down here a little bit worse.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.800]   And then if you use AI dubbing, it's even worse.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:34.280]   I think video games are six times the revenue for movies
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:34.800]   today.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.800]   Have you thought about video games?
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.280]   I've got to assume folks have approached you.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.600]   And how do you think about the video game industry?
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.480]   Because you have a lot of audience overlap,
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.280]   I've got to imagine.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.020]   To be honest, I tried to build one.
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.760]   And then six months in, I was like, oh,
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.760]   these things take years.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.720]   And then I was like, I'd rather sell chocolate.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.160]   So yeah, that was kind of the extent of it.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.740]   I mean, obviously, it's a no-brainer.
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.040]   Because it's much easier just to tell people to download it.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.340]   Just click the link in the description and download it.
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.640]   But I've just found that--
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.360]   I don't know.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.720]   I just keep going back to it.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.060]   Making confectionery products is just so much more fun.
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.600]   And 100 million people are walking to Walmart every month.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.320]   And if you don't have a product there,
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.360]   there's nothing for them to buy.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.080]   And so I just want to maximize that,
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.960]   getting something in every retailer in America first.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.840]   One of the things that you've done
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:24.600]   is you've mentored younger content creators coming up.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.220]   Who are people that you look at that
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.400]   are creating things that you think are interesting,
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.800]   whether it's formats or--
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:30.300]   I'm curious.
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.360]   How many of you guys make content out there?
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.840]   Like, anything?
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.600]   OK.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.640]   I mean, we do.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.240]   A little bit.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:37.760]   I guess so.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:38.840]   Actually, do you have--
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.080]   I guess we're many podcasters.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:40.920]   --podcasts for us?
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.640]   I mean, our viewership on YouTube
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.480]   is embarrassingly small compared to yours.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.860]   One of the things he did first was
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.280]   he ripped apart our thumbnails.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:48.780]   Oh, yeah?
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.520]   He said our thumbnails were total shit.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.160]   I mean, that--
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:51.660]   Remember?
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:52.920]   And we gave that to Nick.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.440]   Was I joking, or was I being serious?
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:54.960]   No, you were--
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.440]   Oh, I mean--
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.320]   So I think you guys, like--
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.560]   I mean, clearly, it's working.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.200]   I think that no one cares about your guys' thumbnails.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.360]   I think the big thing is the value you guys provide
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.640]   and that it's a--
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.720]   Should we not close our mouths now in thumbnails?
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.200]   Oh, you should.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.040]   Aren't the mouths open?
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:07.840]   Yeah, the mouths are open.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:08.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:08.760]   I would close them.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.600]   I mean, there's something different about--
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:10.840]   James, another--
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.920]   Each week of--
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.200]   Especially for this age group, definitely close them.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:14.700]   Well, no.
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:15.440]   I mean, there's--
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:15.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.400]   No one wants to see a shock face.
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.320]   There's something distinctly different about what you do.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.240]   Every week, it's something new.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.680]   It's something original.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.160]   We're trying to have a conversation, McLaughlin group--
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:26.660]   Of course.
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.400]   --kind of format.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.720]   So I think some of those tips don't work.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.480]   But our audience--
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.040]   Agreed.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:35.080]   --on YouTube, I think, now will exceed what we're doing
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.960]   in podcasting, ultimately, because it
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.120]   does seem that people like to watch us
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.560]   and put it on in the background.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.440]   So we're seeing that.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.480]   I think we have 380,000.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.320]   You guys are doing great.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.000]   To be honest, I remember when you first started it.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.040]   And I was like, oh, this is an interesting combo.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:48.720]   But it works.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.640]   And whenever something weird in the world happens, I'm like,
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.560]   oh, I'm going to go see what they think of it.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.560]   It's cool.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.560]   Where do you see this--
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.520]   We met Jimmy at poker, by the way.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.520]   Do you think we could--
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.840]   No, where do you think this is going to be in 20 years?
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:03.920]   What, your podcast?
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.420]   You.
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:06.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.120]   No, I mean, we have an idea where this is going.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.920]   I don't know where this will be in 20 days.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.040]   But to be honest, the only thing in front of us right now
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:16.520]   are The Daily from The New York Times,
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.440]   A Priest Reading the Bible, and Serial Killer Podcast.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.440]   Serial Killer Podcast.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.440]   Yeah, I mean, it's really not much ahead of us.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.720]   But all the podcasts are in news.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.840]   All the podcasting, those are the three ahead of us.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.340]   Yeah.
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.120]   And just to build on J-Kal's question,
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.120]   are you being--
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.680]   do you feel pressured to elongate the content?
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.600]   Or you feel like you've optimized now
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.920]   the amount of time where you maximize viewership?
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.280]   Well, yeah, I mean, that's actually
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.880]   something we've been focused on a lot recently.
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.760]   I think the problem is people are like, we waited two weeks,
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.320]   and it was just 15 minutes of content.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.560]   They actually get annoyed when it's too short.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.240]   So we're working on elongating it,
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.200]   but not because of algorithms or anything.
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.040]   It's just like people just actually
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.720]   don't like waiting two weeks for just 15 minutes of content.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.240]   They want more or more frequent videos.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.480]   And the problem is the spectacles are so big,
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.440]   it's much easier just to make it longer than do a whole new one
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.600]   to upload more.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.880]   So yeah, they're naturally getting longer and longer
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:08.400]   right now.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.480]   I wonder if you did a behind the scenes on the off week
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.680]   and just had another group--
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.080]   because I was watching the one you did where you were all
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.320]   on a raft, and you decided to torture your team.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.560]   We spent seven days on a raft in the ocean.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.560]   I mean, it was torture.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:23.880]   I mean, it was painful to watch.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.360]   But a behind the scenes of that done
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.760]   by another group of video editors on the off week,
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.200]   I bet you would do as many views.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.040]   Yeah, the thing is, though, the mystery
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.200]   is part of what's cool.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.640]   How does this random YouTuber give a million dollars
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.720]   away to someone on the street or things like that?
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.840]   So part of it is them not knowing how it's even possible
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.280]   is why it's so interesting, and they click on it,
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.640]   if that makes sense.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:47.200]   Can you talk a little bit about the point of view
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.680]   where folks say content creators on YouTube have an audience,
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.280]   and that audience ages out, and then they lose that audience?
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.520]   And how you continue to be able to grow your audience?
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.680]   Yeah, well, everything is--
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.800]   Some of the folks you started with have gotten older.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.680]   Yeah, it's just like the problem is every advice is--
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.400]   there's no one size fits all advice.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.920]   And so obviously, if we're talking to someone who
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.880]   unboxes toys, their audience is going to grow,
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.840]   and there's nothing they can do about it.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.480]   But for us, ideally, one day, you guys
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.400]   aren't going to be like, oh, my kid loves you.
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.640]   You'll be like, I also like your content.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:23.000]   But we try to make content that no matter what age you are,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:23.680]   you'll enjoy it.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.640]   So usually, they don't--
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.680]   Who here personally watches Beast?
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.360]   Oh, more than I would have thought.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.560]   Oh, yeah, us too.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.160]   All right, everybody.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:31.880]   Jimmy Donaldson.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.680]   And the timer says 25 seconds.
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.840]   Oh, we went over 25 seconds.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.440]   We went over.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.560]   We gave you an extra.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.240]   Well, you can stay up here if you want.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.800]   We're going to take questions from the audience.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.400]   I'll take a question from the audience.
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:41.720]   All right, well--
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.800]   I flew out here for this.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:43.680]   Let's do some more.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.300]   OK, I'm going to moderate the question.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.440]   Raise your hand.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:51.720]   How do you stay consistent with executing so frequently?
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.840]   I think that's the hardest thing for entrepreneurs.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.720]   I'm going to repeat.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.800]   I'll repeat it.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.440]   How do you stay so consistent with what?
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.720]   With your execution.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.960]   So incredible execution, so hard,
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.600]   being spot on all the time.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.840]   Yeah, he said, how do you be so consistent with execution,
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.760]   spot on all the time?
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.000]   So the thing is, you just have to obviously just
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.240]   train great people.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.080]   Because if you're doing everything yourself,
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.920]   eventually you're going to burn out, get different interests,
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.620]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:19.440]   And so I actually--
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.960]   my top people--
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.560]   I bought a house, and we all lived together for years.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.440]   I just kind of trained them to think like me
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.760]   and see the world like me.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:31.400]   And so my top probably 12 people, 95% of the time,
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.800]   if you ask them something and ask me in different rooms,
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.200]   we'll give the exact same answer.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.400]   And the other 5% of the time will just
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.560]   be very slightly different.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.200]   Have you thrown away a video because you
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.240]   were unsatisfied with it?
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.480]   Oh, of course, all the time.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.760]   That happens all the time.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.440]   So out of 10 videos, how many would be--
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.460]   Well, the thing is, if you want to build viewership over time,
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.080]   if you want to go from 10 million to 20 million views
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.420]   a video to 30 million views a video,
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.800]   you just have to get it where every time they show up,
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.800]   they're happy.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.720]   They feel like they got value out of it.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.320]   It was worth their time and investment.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.680]   So yeah, if something's not good and they click on it,
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.800]   then they're less likely to click on future videos.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.640]   So you can only-- yeah, to grow viewership like that,
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.360]   it has to be--
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.160]   Want to take a second one?
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:06.800]   Yeah, take one.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:07.300]   Right here.
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:07.800]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:24.660]   Thank you.
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.080]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.120]   You repeat the question.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:28.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.120]   I don't know how to repeat that one.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.120]   Not as easy as it looks.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.120]   That's how he does it.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.400]   He would like to know how you're a normal person
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.520]   and you stay so authentic given this incredible--
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.360]   Keep your humility.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.360]   Yeah, how do you keep your humility?
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:41.760]   And stay humble, yeah.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.120]   Well, I think the beauty of it is I usually spend 99%
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.120]   of my time in my studio.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.200]   So I don't really--
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.200]   like, the 100 million number on the video
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.960]   just looks like pixels on a screen.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.880]   Like, I don't really experience it that much.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.620]   So I think that's kind of the best part.
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.840]   How do you walk through an airport these days
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.720]   or walk through a city?
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.120]   It is pretty crazy, huh?
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.960]   I was really worried about getting you here.
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.360]   I kept asking them, how are we going to get him through LAX?
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.320]   I don't understand how this is going to happen.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.200]   The thing is you throw a hood on and wear some glasses,
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.200]   and you're pretty good.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:10.520]   You're pretty good, yeah.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.040]   And you just don't talk out loud or anything like that.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:13.560]   Yeah, I know.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.320]   Same thing.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.240]   All right, everybody.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.560]   Give it up for Jimmy Donaldson.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:18.060]   Thank you.
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:18.560]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.520]   It was fun.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.320]   That was awesome.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.020]   These are great.

[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.340]   And it said--
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.300]   We open sourced it to the fans, and they've
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.820]   just gone crazy with it.
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:36.420]   Love you, Wes.
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:37.820]   I'm the queen of Kinwan.

[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:41.280]   What?
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.740]   You're Winners Live.

[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:45.740]   Besties are gone.
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.340]   That is my dog taking a piss in your driveway.
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:52.800]   Oh, man.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.800]   My athlete, Asher, will meet me at place.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.300]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:58.800]   orgy, because they're all just useless.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.800]   It's like this sexual tension, but they just
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.800]   need to release themselves.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:03.300]   What?
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:04.800]   You're the B.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:05.300]   What?
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:05.800]   You're a B.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:06.300]   You're a B.
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:06.800]   B.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.300]   What?
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.300]   That's going to be good.
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.300]   We need to get merch.
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:09.800]   Besties are gone.
