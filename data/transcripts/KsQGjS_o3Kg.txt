[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.360]   Father, thank you for this retreat.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.160]   Thank you that we are able to spend time together
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.200]   as a church, to connect with each other
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.040]   and to connect with you, Lord.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.160]   At this retreat and onward, may we strive to build up your church
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.280]   and love with eager hearts to fellowship with one another
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.160]   and spur each other on toward love and good deeds.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.120]   Above all, let us seek you first, your kingdom
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.760]   and your righteousness, that our greatest desire would be to know
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.600]   and treasure Christ and to make him known.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.360]   May the praises that we sing now be a blessing to you,
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.000]   that our hearts would be encouraged
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.080]   to sing together the great truths about the gospel
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.600]   and that you may be glorified.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.480]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.

[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:28.880]   You may be seated.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.880]   Well, welcome.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.880]   You came back.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.880]   This is good.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.880]   Well, it's good to see you.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.880]   Now, this is the hard session of the entire retreat because it's after lunch.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.880]   All right?
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.880]   And I understand how that is, sugar levels and the whole thing.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.880]   So, I'm going to do my very best, stopping short of standing on my head in the corner
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.880]   and spitting nickels.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.880]   I'm going to do my very best to keep you awake and keep you going and focused on what's happening
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.880]   here.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.880]   Well, we want to turn to the issue of repentance.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.880]   All right?
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.880]   Now, why is this so important?
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.520]   Why is this so important? because when you read books, secular books as well as many
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:12.560]   Christian books, this is a strangely, again, neglected topic when it comes to conflict
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.600]   reconciliation.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:22.000]   And yet, reconciliation is critical here, but you can't get there without going through
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.960]   the territory of repentance.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.960]   You can't do that.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.960]   It's impossible.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.160]   There are no roads around this.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.520]   There's no way to fly over it.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.960]   You have to go straight through the process of repentance.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:39.840]   And as I'm talking about this this afternoon, I want you to really focus on you, not the
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.920]   person you may have a conflict with.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.720]   I want you to focus on you.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.080]   What are we talking about in reference to you?
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:54.080]   Now, one way I can probably illustrate this is by sharing with you a really quick story
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.880]   about how I got involved in biblical counseling.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:03.160]   You've got to understand, I did not get involved in this willfully.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.120]   God dragged me into it kicking and screaming.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.120]   Okay?
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.120]   He did.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.640]   I went to seminary and graduated from seminary.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:17.040]   I loved everything that I received in seminary, especially the biblical languages.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:23.000]   I just ate those up and I got to a point where I loved Hebrew so much.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   I was a...
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.400]   When I was a young boy, I was dyslexic.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.920]   If you took a look at my third grade homework, I wrote everything perfectly backwards.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.720]   And if you held it up to a mirror, you could read it.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.720]   All right?
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.720]   And I think that's one of the reasons why I loved Hebrew.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.840]   It was natural for me to read that direction.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.840]   All right?
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.280]   Just natural for me.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.280]   And I just loved it.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.600]   So I ended up teaching Hebrew.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.480]   I added Hebrew lexicons and everything for publication.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.140]   And I just loved doing those kind of things.
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.760]   So I graduated from seminary.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.600]   And one of the things that I really wanted to do, my whole focus through seminary was
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.520]   to learn how to preach well.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.520]   All right?
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.400]   And I still think to this day, I'm a whole lot better preacher than I am a counselor.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.440]   I have to really work at counseling.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.440]   Okay?
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.880]   It takes a lot of work, a lot of effort.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:16.120]   So I graduated from seminary, and there's probably no one on the planet more dangerous
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.640]   than a person straight out of seminary.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.920]   All right?
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.200]   Because they believe that they have the entire world figured out.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.520]   They got everything together theologically.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.160]   They've got it all nailed down.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.280]   And I was one of those people.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:38.780]   And I went on staff of a church, and eventually with the goal of actually planning a daughter
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.400]   church off of that particular church.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.400]   That was the goal.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.320]   So I was all excited about it.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:48.360]   But the senior pastor of the church required everybody on staff, secretaries, all staff,
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.680]   everybody on staff, to get biblical counseling training.
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:56.000]   Now, you understand, I just spent four years in college and four years in seminary.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.040]   The last thing I wanted to do was go back into a classroom.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.920]   I really had a bad attitude about it.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.800]   "Oh, my goodness, I have to do this."
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:08.560]   A good deal of my undergraduate work and even a lot of my seminary work was in the area
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.520]   of psychology.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.360]   And especially in the seminary work was in the area of Christian psychology.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.520]   That was the focus of the whole thing.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:23.320]   So in order to be on staff of this particular church, I had to jump through that hoop.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.720]   And I had a real bad attitude.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.160]   Made matters worse, this class I had to take was a three-hour drive away.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.400]   It started at 9 o'clock in the morning, went all day long, and ended at 10 o'clock at night.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.680]   And it went on for 12 weeks, every Monday for 12 weeks.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.440]   All right?
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.620]   So, you think your classes are long.
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.640]   My goodness, 12 weeks of intensive work.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:56.000]   And I went, I remember the first day driving there on the freeway, grumbling, complaining,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.320]   sinning all over the freeway.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.320]   Okay?
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.520]   "Why am I doing this?
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.040]   I don't understand why I'm doing this.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.520]   I'm going to jump through this hoop and get through this type of thing."
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.840]   So I went, the class started at 9 o'clock.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:14.840]   I sat in the very back, hunched down like this on my Bible notebook, hoping nobody will
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:21.240]   see me, and just going to endure the next 12 weeks.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.400]   Went through the class until about noontime, broke for lunch.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.880]   After lunch, we were assigned to sit in on actual counseling.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:36.760]   Myself, another pastor was assigned to sit in on a counseling that a good friend of mine,
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.660]   Dr. Bill Gooden, at that time, I didn't know Bill, but later on he became a really good
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.660]   friend of mine.
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:47.820]   Bill really loved the Lord, and he was the counselor.
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:52.020]   And so I sat at one end of the desk, this other pastor sat at the other end of the desk,
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.020]   and Bill was at one end.
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:58.460]   He said, "You know, I've got people coming in that drove out of state, from out of state,
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.740]   to come and receive counseling here.
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.460]   I don't even know why they're coming."
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.780]   He says, "But let's pray about it."
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:05.780]   So we prayed.
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:10.420]   Eventually, that couple showed up, and they came in, and this was an elderly couple, probably
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:14.100]   in their late 70s, early 80s.
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:20.180]   He was really well-dressed, three-piece suit on, tie, cuff links, the whole shoot and match.
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:24.780]   She had a beautiful dress on, but I noticed none of them, neither of them looked us in
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.780]   the eye.
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.220]   They just acknowledged our existence.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.380]   Bill had told us, "Now, you guys are in training.
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.600]   We don't want you to say anything.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.580]   Just observe, unless I call on you."
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.700]   I was more than willing to do that.
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.060]   All right?
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.780]   So I'm going to sit there and be a little fly on the wall.
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.260]   I could be a really good fly.
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:45.160]   So I'm going to sit there and just kind of observe what happens here.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.780]   So Bill had prayer with them.
[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.740]   After prayer, he said, "I understand you've driven from out of state.
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:50.900]   You've come a long ways.
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.460]   Obviously, what's going on in your life is really, really important.
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:58.080]   Tell me why you are here."
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.820]   And there was this long silence.
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:10.500]   Very soon, the husband spoke up and he said, "I have a company that I own.
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.340]   I have about 600 people that work for me.
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:20.420]   I have been the chairman of the board of our church for the last three decades.
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:25.700]   And this past week, I was arrested in a public park for flashing people."
[00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:33.500]   Now, they tell you in counseling, you're not supposed to look shocked at anything.
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:42.860]   But I'm sure that I look something like, "What is an almost 80-year-old guy doing in a public
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:51.020]   park in the middle of winter flashing people?"
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:56.140]   Did not make any sense to me whatsoever.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:00.300]   And I thought to myself at that particular point, "Hmm, this ought to be interesting.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:06.660]   I want to see how Bill deals with this thing."
[00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:17.740]   And this elderly man went on to explain the fact that in their community, he and his wife
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:22.140]   and their family had been at the pinnacle of respect in their community.
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:27.300]   And when all of this came to light, they went from the pinnacle of respect to being rejects
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.300]   overnight.
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:32.820]   Appeared on the front page of the paper, brought his name through the mud, brought his church's
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.460]   name through the mud, brought his company's name through the mud.
[00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.580]   All of this was just everything overnight.
[00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:45.620]   Boom, instantly gone.
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.900]   His wife was devastated.
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:58.860]   She had no idea that this was something that her husband was participating in.
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.780]   No idea.
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:06.120]   So I'm sitting there thinking, "Hmm, this ought to be interesting."
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.200]   So I'm thinking to myself, "Okay, John, you just graduated from seminary.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.980]   After all, you know everything.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.820]   How would you deal with this guy?
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:20.020]   Where would you go in Scripture to address this problem?"
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:28.260]   And the first thing that came to my mind was David dancing naked before God.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.340]   I knew that that was not going to help things.
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.540]   It was going to make matters worse.
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.400]   Can't use that passage.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:43.700]   I started thumbing in the back of my English Bible for the word "flashing" just in case
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.340]   I had missed it.
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.480]   It's not there.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.820]   So it's easy to conclude, "Wow, you know, the Bible really doesn't deal with this issue.
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:59.560]   We're going to have to reach out to other sources in order to address this particular
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.560]   issue."
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:12.660]   And then I saw Bill Good open his Bible and begin addressing that man's heart, much in
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:17.460]   a similar way that I talked about in our first session.
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:24.880]   What are the central, commanding, dominating cravings that are idolatrous in your heart,
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:33.540]   and at the same time minister hope to that devastated wife?
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:42.300]   And it dawned on me at this particular time, "Wow, seminary taught me how to dispense the
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:47.460]   Bible, but it didn't teach me how to minister the Bible.
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:52.740]   It taught me how to deliver truth, but didn't teach me how to minister where people are
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.980]   really hurting.
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.300]   Didn't teach me that.
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.580]   I had no clue.
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.420]   I had no clue.
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:06.580]   I could parse verbs and participles in the Hebrew and Greek language with the best of
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:11.140]   them, but that didn't mean I knew how to minister the Bible.
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:16.980]   It didn't mean I knew that at all.
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.660]   I went home that night, three-hour drive home.
[00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:27.700]   I had to repent and ask God to forgive me.
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.100]   I thought I had everything figured out.
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.140]   I didn't have everything figured out.
[00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:41.020]   I got home and my wife had just gone to bed, and I woke her up.
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:43.180]   She was kind of half asleep.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:47.380]   And she rubbed her eyes and looked at me and squinted a little bit.
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:51.580]   And I knelt next to the bed and I said, "Sweetheart, I'm a lousy husband.
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:52.900]   I'm a lousy father.
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.660]   I'm a lousy pastor.
[00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.080]   Will you ever forgive me?"
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:02.180]   And she looked at me and she goes, "I don't know what this class is doing, but I like
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:09.700]   it."
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.340]   That was a turning point in my ministry.
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.500]   True story.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:21.300]   All of a sudden now, addressing serious problems strictly from a biblical point of view now
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:29.020]   become paradigm, a very important paradigm in my life.
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:33.620]   It became critical for my ministry.
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:40.100]   That was almost 45 years ago, right?
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.500]   Long time ago.
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:49.700]   And since then, I have never regretted for one nanosecond the direction that God took
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.420]   me in.
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.300]   Never regretted it.
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:27:02.880]   I've seen God take the most horrible circumstances and turn them around for good with people
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:16.580]   who are murderers, with people who are sex abusers, with people who have serious, serious
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:25.820]   struggles with depression, with people who are fearful and plagued by what the world
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:34.340]   would call panic attacks, people that are overwhelmed with anxiety, people who have
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:39.860]   problems in their interpersonal relationships.
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:46.300]   And I've seen God take them just simply and carefully ministering, not dispensing, ministering
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:50.820]   the Word of God to where people are coming from.
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:55.500]   This is where the change really takes place.
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:28:01.620]   Well, we want to talk about the issue of repentance.
[00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.580]   That's really critical at this point.
[00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:11.100]   So if you have your notes in front of you, there's a little comment that we make there,
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:17.580]   "Resolution of conflict involves a careful understanding and practice of repentance.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:23.620]   Repentance of sin is proved genuine when it's followed by a thorough repentance.
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:28.900]   Repentance involves a change of mind that is so complete that it leads to a change of
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.620]   life."
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.940]   God is clear.
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:37.140]   He does not desire mere peace.
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:43.700]   He desires complete and full reconciliation.
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:51.720]   When there's a conflict, there's an interpersonal conflict, this is what God desires.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:56.760]   The word repent basically means to turn or to change.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:03.220]   And it's best illustrated by the picture of someone who is walking one way, does an about
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.060]   face and heads the opposite direction.
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:12.420]   When I was in the military, that's what we used to call it, to do an about face, go the
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:16.300]   opposite direction.
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.420]   Repentance is a necessary component of genuine conversion.
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:26.180]   Luke chapter 3 verse 3, 2 Corinthians 7, 10, "Unsaved people must turn from sin, which
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:31.340]   is the status self-rule that they've lived in as their own Lord and Master."
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:35.980]   Romans chapter 10 verse 9, 1 John 3, 4.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:40.380]   But repentance also remains continually necessary after conversion.
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.740]   We see this in the life of David in Psalm 51.
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:47.940]   You can see this in Jesus' teaching in Luke 17 verses 3 through 4.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:54.600]   "Saved persons must turn from sins, which are the specific symptoms of a lingering disease
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.660]   called the flesh."
[00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:04.420]   Now all true repentance has reference to a turning from the state or occurrence of a
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:11.500]   sin and turning to God for forgiveness and renewal.
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:17.900]   Scripture often alludes to a false repentance that does not actually bring forgiveness.
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:24.500]   So we've got to understand some elements, some effects and examples of repentance in
[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:31.820]   order to practice it ourselves and to help others do so as well.
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:36.140]   So let's talk about this for a moment.
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:41.580]   Let's talk about some of the elements of true repentance.
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:48.860]   And the first thing that's really key here is that of comprehending.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:58.700]   We must understand the truth relevant to our sin and our Savior before we can repent.
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:08.340]   The Greek word most often translated repentance is the term metanoeo, which denotes a change
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.820]   of mind.
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:21.780]   In fact, it's a compound word which actually means meta, which means after, and mind or
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:29.140]   noeo, which means mind, that would be the verbal form, or nous, which means mind, that
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.840]   would be the noun form of it.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:44.400]   So it means afterthought or hence change of mind about a particular attitude, a deed,
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:56.260]   or behavior, or words, or circumstances, real change in conflict reconciliation has to go
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.420]   through repentance.
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:06.160]   Now, the way that the word is used, if you just take a look at the etymology of the word,
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.920]   you're not going to get the full sense of it.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:16.900]   You've got to trace through the New Testament the way in which metanoeo is used.
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:23.440]   And when you trace it through, you find out that it means more than just a change of mind.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:28.340]   Every time it's used, it's used within the context where there is a change of mind that
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:34.520]   is so complete that it leads to an entire change of life.
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:39.800]   In other words, it's fundamental to changing everything within us.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:45.120]   It is fundamental.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:51.760]   It's way more than just saying, "Oh God, I'm sorry about this."
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:56.120]   Nowhere in the Bible does it ever say we're supposed to say we're sorry.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.320]   It doesn't say that.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:04.100]   What do you mean by that when you say you're sorry?
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:07.120]   You just want to get rid of your guilt?
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:12.540]   The question is, what did you do that was wrong?
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:16.880]   And what do you need to do in order to make it right?
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:21.400]   And who do you need to make it right with?
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:31.800]   All sin involves a breaking of a relationship, first and foremost with God, but then secondly
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:39.380]   with the people around us, because sin always brings alienated relationships.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:48.800]   It always yields the fruit of alienated relationships, first with God, then with others.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:58.940]   So if I'm truly repentant, I see what I've done, I comprehend it to be an awful sin that
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:05.900]   is really an attack upon the God that I say that I love and the God that I say that I
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:15.100]   serve, first and foremost, and then I have to understand how my sin has affected others
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.220]   around me.
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.940]   How has it affected my wife?
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.940]   How has it affected my husband?
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.900]   How has it affected my children?
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.100]   How has it affected the people that I work with?
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.300]   How has it affected my friends at church?
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.260]   How has it affected all of my relationship?
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:36.740]   Because there is an effect there, even though at first you may not even perceive it.
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:46.460]   Sin, there is always that lingering effect that's always going to be there.
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:51.340]   So the question is, how has it affected those relationships?
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:35:02.860]   I can't really deal with that interpersonal relationship until I see my own sin, I comprehend
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:09.580]   that it has been first a rebellion against God, and then it has affected my relationship
[00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.860]   with others.
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:20.140]   I've got to see the vertical impact as well as the horizontal impact of my sin.
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.660]   I've got to see that.
[00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:27.820]   If there's going to be real change in interpersonal relationships, you've got to be able to see
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.020]   that on your personal level.
[00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:33.980]   You've got to be able to comprehend that.
[00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:42.980]   What did you do or think or want that was wrong?
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:48.100]   What's guiding your desires?
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:53.020]   What is it that you're craving in the depths of your heart, as we talked about in our first
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:54.380]   session?
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:36:02.460]   What seems to dominate or rule your thoughts at that particular time?
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:06.780]   That's where you need to repent.
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.820]   So you have to comprehend this.
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.940]   What is the idea that's here?
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.620]   There's a second element here.
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:19.380]   The second element has to do with confession.
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:23.540]   Now the twofold nature of inward confession is revealed in the meaning of the Greek word
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.500]   homo legao.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.140]   It means to say the same thing.
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:33.060]   That's what it means, to say the same thing.
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:40.460]   Homo means same, legao means to speak or to say, hence homo legao, to say the same thing.
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:49.060]   So when I confess my sin, listen to this, I say the same thing about it that God says.
[00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:52.740]   I acknowledge that that is a sin.
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:58.940]   The attitude that I have, the desire that I have, the craving that I have, the actions
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:06.420]   I have, the verbal way that I respond to other people, that's sinful.
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:10.980]   Even the very disposition of my heart is sinful.
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:16.660]   It's like a husband and wife that gets into an argument in their morning before he leaves
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:17.660]   for work.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:26.220]   She's upset, he's upset, he storms out the door, slams the door, jumps in the car, wheels
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:32.900]   the car around spinning real estate all over the place, jumps on the road, off onto the
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:41.020]   freeway weaving in and out of cars, thinking to himself, "I hope the children make her
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:46.480]   day miserable."
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.180]   What is that?
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.660]   That's malice.
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:53.300]   That is malice.
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:59.260]   She's standing there in the kitchen, she's thinking to herself, "I hope he has a rotten
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.260]   day."
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:04.500]   "Everything goes wrong at work."
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:08.540]   Malice.
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:09.540]   What is that?
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:14.940]   A general wishing of ill will towards someone else.
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:21.580]   General wishing of ill will towards someone else.
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:26.220]   I remember when I was in high school, I sat next to a girl, no matter how hard I studied
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.260]   for that particular subject, she always got a better grade than I did.
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:35.180]   I remember sitting there thinking, "Oh God, if you just let her flunk one exam."
[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:38.100]   That's malice.
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:39.100]   That's just malice.
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.220]   That's wicked.
[00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.600]   That's just wicked maliceness.
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.780]   You wish bad on somebody else.
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:49.740]   That comes out of the heart, and it comes from what you want.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:55.660]   You think that there is something there that's going to bring you happiness that you're receiving
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:39:02.100]   or you're not receiving, or that you're not receiving, and sometimes it's something that
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:07.020]   you wish we were receiving that would bring us happiness and we don't receive it.
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:12.260]   And that causes maliceness, because you see that other person as an obstacle to getting
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:16.940]   what you really want.
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.420]   So you've got to be willing to say, "No, no, no, you know what?
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:20.820]   That is sin."
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:24.300]   You have to acknowledge to God the fact of your sin and agree with God about the nature
[00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.300]   of your sin.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:29.300]   That's really key.
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.340]   Let's go to an Old Testament passage real quickly.
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:34.580]   Let's go to Proverbs 28, verse 13.
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:39.740]   You're familiar with this passage, I'm sure.
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:43.820]   But I will frequently use a passage like this in counseling.
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:51.580]   "He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.300]   them will find compassion."
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.380]   Proverbs 28, 13.
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:01.220]   "He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper," God says.
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:07.020]   I will make sure that if you decide to hide your sin and not to confess it before me,
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:13.060]   I'm going to make sure your life will not prosper.
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:19.580]   But he who confesses and forsakes them will find compassion.
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:25.020]   Wow, that's significant.
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:31.860]   In fact, early on, let's go back to Psalm chapter 32.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:37.780]   Look at this Psalm of David, Psalm 32.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.940]   This is a masculine.
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:45.180]   That means it was a regular teaching song in the temple area.
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.980]   Regular teaching song in the temple area.
[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:53.740]   This is what was regularly taught over and over and over again.
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:41:00.340]   Psalm 32 says, "How blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:05.780]   How blessed is the man whom the Lord does not impute iniquity and in whose spirit there
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.440]   is no deceit.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:14.580]   When I kept silent about my sin," verse 3, "my body wasted away through my groanings
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.420]   all day long, for day and night your hand was heavy upon me.
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:22.300]   My vitality was drained away as with the fever heat of summer."
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.540]   Let me stop there just for a moment.
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:30.460]   You know, over the past 40 years, I've worked with a lot of people who struggle with depression.
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:38.700]   I'm absolutely convinced 60% of them, if not 70%, 60% of people who struggle with depression
[00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:44.140]   are really at the very core struggling with guilt.
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.820]   Everybody that's struggling with guilt here.
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.900]   And notice how he describes himself.
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:54.580]   He says, "When I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away through my groaning all
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.740]   day long, for day and night your hand was heavy upon me.
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.940]   My vitality was drained away as with the fever heat of summer."
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:08.100]   That's describing somebody severely depressed because of guilt.
[00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:12.640]   Nobody taught them how to deal with guilt.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:19.860]   Verse 5, "I acknowledged my sin to you," there's the confession, "and my iniquity I did not
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:24.700]   hide," or actually that word "hide" is the word "cover" in Hebrew.
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:28.340]   "My iniquity I did not cover.
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:33.340]   I said I would confess my transgression to the Lord, and you forgave the guilt of my
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:34.340]   sin."
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:38.500]   Now, listen, I hope you're adding this up.
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:47.460]   He's basically saying in verse 5, "What I uncover and become naked before God, God covers,"
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:50.380]   verse 1, "with His forgiveness."
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.380]   See that?
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:58.540]   "What I uncover," in verse 5, "and become naked about before God, God covers with His
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:02.380]   forgiveness," verse 1.
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:03.380]   Look at verse 1 again.
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:06.940]   "How blessed is He whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered."
[00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:12.740]   Now, by the way, we're going to come back to that when we talk about forgiveness because
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.820]   that becomes a really key verse.
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:16.580]   All right?
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:18.940]   That becomes a really key verse for us.
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:24.660]   But right now, I just want you to see that when we decide to uncover ourselves before
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:30.900]   God, when we decide to confess our sins before God, when we become naked before Him, "Lord,
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:37.860]   here I am with all of my iniquity, with all of my sin, I'm revealing it all to You," then
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:41.940]   God covers with His forgiveness.
[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.220]   Wow.
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:49.380]   That's significant.
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:56.820]   So the idea is that we've got to be able to comprehend both vertically and horizontally
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:03.920]   how our sin has had its impact on our relationship to God and then how our sin has had an impact
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.260]   upon our relationship with others.
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:13.780]   We've got to be willing to confess our sins and repentance is, or I should say, confession
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:19.380]   is proved genuine through repentance.
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:22.340]   So we need to follow it through.
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:27.260]   Now, let's go to 2 Corinthians chapter 7.
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:32.540]   2 Corinthians chapter 7.
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:40.220]   Because there is a fake repentance.
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:47.340]   There is a fake sorrow.
[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:59.900]   And in 2 Corinthians chapter 7 and verse 10, Paul contrasts worldly sorrow with godly sorrow.
[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:03.620]   Worldly sorrow with godly sorrow.
[00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:05.620]   And he starts with godly sorrow.
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:10.980]   He says, "For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance,"
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:20.620]   here you are, "without regret, leading to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:23.180]   death."
[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:28.220]   The sorrow of the world produces death.
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:38.820]   Now, godly repentance has a, or godly sorrow has a repentance without regret.
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:39.980]   What does that mean?
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:47.180]   That means that when you turn away from your sin, you don't regret leaving it.
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.200]   What it means?
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:53.420]   When you turn away from your sin, you don't regret leaving it.
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:56.660]   Remember the story of Lot, Lot's wife?
[00:45:56.660 --> 00:46:01.920]   God had commanded Lot and his wife to leave Sodom and Gomorrah because they had become
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:06.860]   an LGBTQIA community.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:10.260]   That's the reason why he commanded them to leave.
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.060]   Get out of there.
[00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:15.320]   That place is headed for destruction.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:20.760]   And by the way, when you leave, don't even look back.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.840]   So they left.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:29.860]   And even though Lot's wife, her body had left Sodom and Gomorrah, externally her actions
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:33.780]   said that she had left that, her heart was still back there.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:34.980]   How do you know?
[00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:42.220]   She's looking longingly over her shoulder back at her hometown, where that's where all
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:44.140]   of her friends were.
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:47.100]   That's where she raised her family.
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:52.460]   That's what she's known for most of her life.
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:58.940]   She's looking over her shoulder, regretting having to leave there.
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:02.540]   God turns her to a pillar of salt.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:04.260]   Why?
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:12.100]   Because her body had left, her body was doing the right thing, but her heart was still there.
[00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:17.140]   It still regretted leaving.
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:23.540]   Genuine repentance leaves no regret.
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:26.780]   It leaves no regret.
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:32.140]   When you leave your sin, you're happy that you're leaving your sin.
[00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:36.000]   That's how you know you're genuinely repentant.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.740]   I'm so happy to have this behind me.
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:42.700]   I don't want to go back to it ever again.
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:46.700]   Lord, help me.
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:50.420]   People leave and they say, "Oh yeah, I'm repentant."
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:55.820]   But their heart is still back in their sin.
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:48:01.220]   Too many times as a counselor I've had to deal with men who have cheated on their wives
[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:05.060]   or wives who have cheated on their husbands.
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.620]   They left their lovers.
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:11.900]   They're going to try to make their marriage work, but you can tell their heart's still
[00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:14.460]   back there.
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.180]   You can tell their heart's still back.
[00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.980]   They're not repentant.
[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:21.920]   And by the way, first opportunity they think they can get away with it, they'll be back
[00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:24.000]   in that sin.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.140]   First opportunity, they'll be back in that sin.
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:29.500]   That's not genuine repentance.
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.340]   That's not godly sorrow.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:36.860]   Godly sorrow leaves no regret.
[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:37.980]   I don't regret leaving.
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:43.540]   I'm happy I left.
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:49.340]   Worldly sorrow, on the other hand, it's like Esau.
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:57.860]   Esau sold his birthright for porridge.
[00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:02.100]   Gave up his birthright, which was the Abrahamic covenant in essence.
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:03.100]   He knew it.
[00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:04.100]   He understood it.
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:08.540]   But he gave it up for a momentary desire to eat food.
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:14.460]   He gave it all up for that particular purpose.
[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:22.460]   And then he expresses sorrow over it later on.
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:29.100]   Not sorrow in the sense that he really wanted the Abrahamic covenant, he really wanted his
[00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:35.460]   birthright.
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:39.300]   Not because he wanted to do the right thing.
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:42.780]   He was stuck.
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:46.660]   There's a worldly sorrow that's there.
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:50.740]   Judas evidenced worldly sorrow, right?
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:54.380]   Judas betrays Jesus, and then what happens to Judas?
[00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:59.380]   After he betrays, he's smitten in conscience over the fact that he has betrayed an innocent
[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:05.660]   man so much so that he goes back to the temple, takes the 30 pieces of silver, throws them
[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:11.940]   back in the temple, and he has a chance at that particular point to genuinely repent
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.340]   before God.
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:16.640]   He could do that, but he doesn't.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:21.020]   He goes out and commits suicide.
[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:23.420]   That's worldly sorrow.
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:28.220]   That's not godly sorrow.
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:39.740]   Plenty examples in Scripture of worldly sorrow, but godly sorrow leaves no regrets, none whatsoever.
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:41.500]   It leads to salvation.
[00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:49.740]   It shows a true Christian, but the sorrow of this world produces all kinds of death.
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:57.900]   If you're confessing your sins, you're calling that particular sin what God calls it.
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:01.500]   You're saying the same thing that God says about that sin.
[00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:06.500]   You're saying, "That attitude in my life, those actions, those words in my life are
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:08.860]   sinful and I know they are.
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:10.900]   I'm going to call it a sin.
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:18.940]   And because it's repugnant to you, God, it's repugnant to me, and I'm leaving that behind.
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:20.940]   I'm confessing that."
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:28.500]   And then notice this, not only does repentance involve this comprehending and involves a
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:34.100]   confession, but it also involves a choosing.
[00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:44.300]   It always includes a willful resolve not to repeat the sin again.
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:51.980]   A willful resolve not to repeat that sin again.
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:58.580]   You're not going to cover it up, as Proverbs 28, 13 says.
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:05.980]   You're asking for forgiveness, but you're not going to be like the person who says,
[00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:07.660]   "Well, you know what?
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:13.380]   I know that God will forgive me, but I'm going to go ahead and do it anyhow."
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:15.500]   Have you ever heard somebody say that?
[00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.180]   You know, God's a big enough God.
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:19.180]   He can forgive me.
[00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:20.460]   It's not about the bigness of God.
[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:27.820]   And by the way, the bigger you make Him, the bigger He can deal with you in judgment.
[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:33.380]   I know God's going to forgive me, but I'm going to go through with the divorce anyhow.
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:41.820]   It's like a man who robs a bank, gets caught, says he's sorry, but refuses to return the
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:46.420]   money.
[00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:51.500]   That is not repentance.
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:57.260]   Several years ago, probably many of you know the story of Bill Clinton, former president
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:58.260]   of the United States.
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:03.060]   I think he's a perfect example of this kind of wrong view of repentance and forgiveness
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:12.420]   and his actions with Monica Lewinsky, the affair that he has with her.
[00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:20.540]   He goes on national television saying to everybody in America, "I'm sorry for what I was caught
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:27.100]   with," and at the exact same time where the president was saying he's sorry, his lawyers
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:32.820]   were trying to prove that he was innocent of what he was saying that he was sorry for.
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:35.260]   That's the way a lot of people are.
[00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:39.140]   Lots of Christians are that way.
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:44.740]   They say they're sorry, but they're trying to convince everybody else that they're innocent
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:48.540]   of what they're saying they're sorry for.
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:51.220]   That's not repentance.
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:53.980]   There never was repentance.
[00:53:53.980 --> 00:54:01.340]   No, if you're going to repent, there's got to be a choice.
[00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:04.420]   Take your Bible, let's go over to 2 Peter 2, verse 22.
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:07.460]   Great illustration that Peter gives us here.
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:08.460]   Look at this closely.
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:16.900]   2 Peter 2, verse 22.
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:20.900]   Peter says, "It happened to them, according to the true proverb, a dog returns to its
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:27.740]   vomit and a sow, after washing, returns to wallowing in the mire."
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:28.820]   Think about that for a moment.
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:33.820]   Why does a dog, it's really gross, sorry about this, but why does a dog go back and eat its
[00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:34.820]   vomit?
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:36.420]   Why does a dog do that?
[00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:40.180]   Why does a pig wallow in the mire?
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:46.380]   You can take a pig, wash a pig, perfume a pig, put a big red bow around that pig, you
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:48.380]   let that pig go, guess what?
[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:53.220]   It's going to find the nearest mud puddle, hop right back in.
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:56.200]   Why does a dog eat its vomit?
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:55:01.140]   Why does a pig keep going back to the mud?
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:06.380]   Answer is, Peter says, it's the nature of a dog to eat vomit.
[00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:10.540]   It's the nature of a pig to wallow in the mud.
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:14.100]   Now, follow me here.
[00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:17.140]   I don't want to lose you.
[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:27.900]   What he's basically saying is this, in true repentance, real genuine repentance, it changes
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:30.260]   our nature.
[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:34.100]   You see?
[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:36.500]   We're no longer dogs.
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.300]   We're no longer pigs.
[00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:40.700]   We no longer eat vomit.
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:44.020]   We no longer jump back into the mud.
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:46.240]   It changes us fundamentally.
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:50.780]   When I'm truly repentant, I am changed on a fundamental level.
[00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:55.220]   There's nothing left in me that's not changed.
[00:55:55.220 --> 00:56:08.620]   I willfully, gladly, willingly, excitedly, with zeal, want to leave my sin.
[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:12.260]   I want to leave it behind.
[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:16.460]   I don't want to ever go back to it.
[00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:25.940]   There has to be this choosing that I will not go back to this sin ever again.
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:27.740]   There has to be that choosing.
[00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:30.340]   There has got to be a devout resolution.
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:33.900]   Now, that doesn't mean that a person can't sin in the future.
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:35.440]   Not saying that.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:40.560]   But if they do, they'll be grieved over their sin, even if they do it again.
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:46.940]   Because as far as their will is concerned, they have decided they will never return to
[00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:49.660]   that sin anymore.
[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:55.760]   They're not going to go back to it.
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:58.820]   I'm not going to go back and say those mean things anymore.
[00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:03.300]   I'm not going to cultivate an attitude of bitterness and resentment and hatred towards
[00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:06.540]   that other person.
[00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:13.380]   I'm not going to be angry with them and cultivate a heart of anger towards them and allow that
[00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:18.220]   to flavor everything I do and see in that person's life.
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:19.220]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:28.140]   I realize that that's sinfulness, and I'm going to get away from that sinfulness.
[00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:31.100]   I'm not going back there.
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:34.420]   All right.
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:39.100]   Now that's the easy part of repentance.
[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:42.580]   You ready for the hard part?
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:46.020]   Fasten your seatbelts and put your crash helmets on.
[00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:49.060]   You ready?
[00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:55.140]   Let's go to the hard part, which has to do with the effects of repentance.
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:58:03.500]   How do we know that I've really repented of this idol in my heart, this idol that's guided
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.380]   me, that's directed me?
[00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:11.980]   How do I know that that's changed?
[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:17.220]   Although repentance itself is an inward turning that takes place in a heart and in mind, it
[00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:21.100]   inevitably leads to change in other areas of a person's life.
[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:25.940]   If it's not accompanied or followed by such effects when they are appropriate, it's not
[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:32.180]   real repentance, but a false one that fails to bring forgiveness.
[00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:40.340]   Let me highlight three things that are key that are a part of the effects of true repentance.
[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:46.300]   Just a biblical theological summary of what it should be in terms of the effects.
[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:49.080]   The first one is this.
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:53.700]   There has to be a desire for restitution.
[00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:57.660]   There has to be a desire for restitution.
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:04.880]   The word means literally to set things right, to set things right.
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:10.060]   When I participate in restitution, I'm trying to set things right that were made wrong by
[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:14.380]   my sin.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:21.760]   We need to fulfill any obligations we have to the party that we have offended.
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:24.440]   That's really significant to see.
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:29.700]   You can trace this through several different places in the Old and New Testament, but let's
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:31.500]   go back to a couple of them real quickly.
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:36.740]   Let's go to Exodus 22 and verse 1.
[00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.540]   Notice what Moses writes here.
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:49.060]   "If man steals an ox or sheep and slaughters it or sells it, he should pay five oxen for
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:51.780]   the ox, four sheep for the sheep."
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:52.820]   What is this?
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:56.660]   This is restitution.
[00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:59.100]   That's restitution.
[00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:13.320]   Anything you've broken, stolen, taken, destroyed, used, that's restitution.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:20.960]   When you take somebody else's wife that's not yours or husband and uses it for your
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:29.760]   own, uses them for your own personal, greedy, covetous, sexual desire, you're using someone
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:33.720]   else, restitution needs to be made.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.240]   Needs to be made.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:44.500]   It's not true repentance unless there's restitution.
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:52.060]   Let's jump to the New Testament and look at this in Luke chapter 19 and verse…well,
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:59.420]   we don't have time to go through the whole thing, but you know this story.
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:08.420]   It's the conversion of Zacchaeus.
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:14.180]   And in verse 8, Luke chapter 19 and verse 8, Zacchaeus is truly saved.
[01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:18.960]   Verse 8 says, "Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, 'Behold, Lord, half of my
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:23.700]   possessions I will give to the poor, and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:27.260]   give back four times as much.'"
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.940]   Notice what Jesus says about him.
[01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:36.620]   He says, "Today salvation has come to this house because he too is a son of Abraham.
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:42.400]   For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost."
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:46.220]   It showed the genuineness of Zacchaeus' heart to do that.
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:50.900]   Zacchaeus was a tax collector, and back in ancient times, tax collectors would collect
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:57.660]   tax from Rome, and they had the right by law to collect additional taxes to support themselves.
[01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:04.020]   It's just that most tax collectors took way beyond what they needed, and so tax collectors
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:11.100]   were filthy rich and had the power of Rome behind them, and they would bilk people out
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:15.900]   of money way beyond the normal taxes.
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:18.580]   And that's why the Jews hated him.
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:24.460]   Most of the people who were tax collectors were Jews, but they were Jews taking advantage
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:28.020]   of other Jews.
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:34.780]   And so they were taking money, but to show Zacchaeus and the fact that he was genuinely
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:40.580]   converted and his heart was right before Christ, he says, "Half of everything I'll give to
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:49.260]   the poor, and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I'll give them back 400% what I
[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:50.820]   took from them."
[01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:54.540]   That's a change of heart.
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:59.660]   That's restitution.
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:07.380]   Back several years ago while I was pastoring back in Ohio, we had planted our church and
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:10.220]   it was growing, everything was going really, really well.
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:15.960]   There were a couple of young men in our church who were pretty sharp young men.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:23.700]   They were entrepreneurial type, and they had this idea to start a business, and they went
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:27.660]   around to all the older men in the church and said, "Hey, what do you think about this?
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:29.580]   We want to start this business.
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:30.580]   We want to get your input.
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:31.580]   Do you think this is a good idea?"
[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:35.020]   And all the older men in the church who were businessmen thought, "Hey, this is a great
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.020]   idea.
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:38.300]   Yeah, looks like you got it all figured out.
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:39.300]   Go for it."
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:47.100]   The only problem is, and this is always true with young men, they had no money.
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:51.180]   Lots of great ideas, no money.
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:55.100]   There was a widow in the church a couple of years before her husband had died, left her
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:57.420]   with a little bit of money.
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:01.660]   So these two young men went to the widow and said, "Listen, if you're willing to loan us
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:09.020]   six figures, we're going to launch this and we will pay you back with interest after we
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:11.340]   get this business launched."
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:14.140]   She was a really sweet gal.
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:19.020]   She thought about it for a while and then she went and said, "Okay, I'm willing to loan
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:20.540]   you the money."
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:26.940]   She didn't have a real lot, but she loaned these two young men this money and they started
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:30.580]   their business and it started with gangbusters.
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:33.100]   They were making money hand over fist.
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:36.200]   It was crazy money.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:46.420]   But eight months after they started their business, the American economy crashed.
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:53.780]   They lost everything, including everything that they had earned.
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:54.780]   Nobody saw it coming.
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:57.160]   The older men in the church didn't see it coming.
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.940]   Nobody saw it coming.
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:02.100]   Lost it all.
[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:05.300]   These two young men were crushed.
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:13.180]   They went back to the lady in our church and they said to her, "We're so sorry.
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:16.740]   We had no idea this was going to happen to the economy.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:17.860]   We've lost all the money.
[01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:19.340]   We don't have any money to pay you back.
[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.900]   Will you forgive us?"
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:25.620]   She was a very sweet gal and she needed that money.
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:30.460]   And she said, "Well, yeah, I'm willing to forgive you."
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:33.220]   The young men said, "We're so thankful.
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.700]   Thank you so much for forgiving us."
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:41.780]   And they're ready to walk away from this until their meddlesome pastor got involved.
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:45.660]   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:46.660]   Back up the train.
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:47.660]   No, no, no, no.
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:52.460]   I want to ask you guys, listen.
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.540]   Does your word mean anything?
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:56.820]   "Well, yeah, pastor.
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:57.820]   I mean..."
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:58.820]   No, no, no.
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:04.420]   Does your word mean anything?
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:09.820]   What did you promise her?
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:12.300]   That we would pay her back?
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:15.740]   With what?
[01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:18.380]   With interest?
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:20.460]   So are you going to do that?
[01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:22.220]   "Well, we had no idea."
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.580]   No, I'm not asking you about what happened.
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:27.380]   You promised her that.
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:33.980]   Does your word mean anything?
[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:36.820]   I don't care if you have to get a job flipping hamburgers.
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:38.780]   I don't care.
[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:41.420]   You need to pay her back.
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:45.620]   You need to make restitution for this.
[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:49.260]   They had young families.
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:50.260]   You know what?
[01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:51.260]   They did.
[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:53.660]   Took them five years.
[01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:57.020]   They paid her back with interest.
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:02.220]   Now, those young men, their word is as good as gold.
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:05.060]   As good as gold.
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:09.980]   But they were ready to walk away from this.
[01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:12.540]   You say you're repentant?
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:17.660]   You say, then you make restitution.
[01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:24.620]   Genuine repentance means you're willing to make things right that your sin and your wrong,
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:33.260]   your promises that you were willing to break, made wrong.
[01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:37.860]   That's restitution.
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:43.060]   Fasten your seatbelts, put your crash armaments on, number two.
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:48.300]   Real repentance also involves reconciliation.
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:49.860]   It also involves reconciliation.
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:56.940]   That's what we're talking about here in conflict reconciliation, right?
[01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:02.060]   When your sin has resulted in a broken relationship with another person, true repentance will
[01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:10.340]   cause you to do whatever you can to transform that conflict into a peaceful and edifying
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:13.620]   friendship.
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:18.200]   It's not where you resolve the issue, the conflict, and then you walk away from it and
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.020]   never speak to that person ever again.
[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:21.260]   No, no, no, no.
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:25.060]   That happens way too much in churches.
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:28.900]   That's why we're not for conflict resolution.
[01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:32.740]   We're for conflict reconciliation.
[01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:38.180]   When parents are dealing with a brother or sister or two brothers or two sisters, and
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:45.580]   they have a fight over a toy or whatever the case may be, parents will often step into
[01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:48.020]   that and say, "Now, stop that, stop that.
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:50.660]   You go to your room and you go to your room.
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:56.500]   Before you go, you need to ask your brother or your sister for forgiveness."
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.260]   And then we do a terrible thing.
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:59.860]   We send them to their respective room.
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:01.260]   No, you shouldn't.
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:02.500]   Never should do that.
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:08.640]   You need to stick them in the smallest room in your house, closet if you will, and teach
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:13.340]   them to play together happily.
[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:15.900]   Really?
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:18.460]   Yes.
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:27.420]   God is after reconciliation, not mere resolving of a conflict.
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:29.580]   God is after reconciliation.
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:39.620]   That means putting that relationship back to where it was better than it was before.
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:45.660]   That's reconciliation.
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:56.060]   It's about bringing parties in conflict together because that is the very fabric of the unity
[01:09:56.060 --> 01:10:05.860]   of the body of Christ, not just in your church but around the world.
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:10.540]   That's the very fabric.
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:14.640]   So the first thing is restitution.
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:19.140]   The second thing is reconciliation.
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:25.100]   And the third thing, tighten your seatbelt, is regret.
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:28.980]   The third thing is regret.
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:30.260]   You say, "Wait a minute.
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:36.260]   I thought you said in 2 Corinthians 7.10 that there is no regret."
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:37.260]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:43.140]   There is no regret in leaving your sin, but there is regret in having done the sin in
[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:44.420]   the first place.
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:46.580]   Follow me?
[01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:51.980]   There's no regret in leaving your sin, but there is regret in having done the sin in
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:54.820]   the first place.
[01:10:54.820 --> 01:11:00.420]   True repentance may not always be accompanied by emotions, especially those that are visible
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:05.740]   to others, but in many cases a feeling of sorrow corroborates other evidences and points
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:13.880]   to a real change in thinking.
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:23.340]   This becomes critical because if a person is truly repentant over their sin, they are
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:40.500]   crushed because of how wicked their sin is before a holy God.
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.380]   Let's go back to James 4.
[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:45.660]   We started there at the beginning.
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:56.180]   Remember when we talked about the issue of the heart earlier in James 4 verses 1 through
[01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:58.780]   3, we talked about that.
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:07.700]   But then he goes back to repentance here and he says in verse 6, James 4.6, "But he gives
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:14.140]   a greater grace, therefore," it says, "God is opposed to the proud but gives grace to
[01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:16.620]   the humble."
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:29.180]   The reason why people don't regret sinning is because of pride.
[01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:36.100]   That's the reason why they don't regret sinning, because of pride.
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:41.300]   Verse 7 says, "Submit therefore to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you because
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:49.340]   pride is at the very core of one of the tools that Satan uses in our life.
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:55.220]   Draw near to God," verse 8 says, "and he will draw near to you.
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:13:01.780]   Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and your hearts, you double-minded."
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:10.420]   Notice how heart is equated with double-mindedness.
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:18.780]   Then he says, here we go, here's true repentance, "Be miserable and mourn and weep.
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:23.820]   Let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy to gloom.
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:27.380]   Humble yourself in the presence of the Lord and he will exalt you.
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:34.460]   When is the last time," listen to this, "you wept over your sin?"
[01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:38.500]   Has that ever happened?
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:44.140]   When was the last time you were so crushed, you wept over your sin?
[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:49.420]   You mourned over it, even though you knew you were forgiven, even though you trusted
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:51.820]   the forgiveness of Christ?
[01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:58.340]   You regretted having done it in the first place.
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:04.260]   There's not going to be true reconciliation among believers until we are grieved over
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:11.300]   the sin that caused the conflict in the first place.
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:16.820]   We have to regret whatever caused that conflict in the first place, regret whatever it is
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:21.140]   in our heart that caused it.
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:23.660]   That has to be there.
[01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:31.500]   Remember, a dog returns to its vomit, a sow returns to the mud.
[01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:41.260]   By the way, there in 2 Peter 2:22, he's actually quoting Proverbs 26:11 about the dog.
[01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:47.820]   So we don't keep entertaining thoughts.
[01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:52.420]   In 1 Peter 1:13, Peter gives us a good exhortation.
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:56.140]   He says, "Gird your mind for action, keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely
[01:14:56.140 --> 01:15:01.860]   on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:05.220]   That should be there.
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:09.100]   That doesn't mean that we're overtaken by our sinful sorrow.
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:13.900]   That doesn't mean that we have to go to our room, curl up in a fetal position, and weep
[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:15.620]   and weep for days and days and days.
[01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:17.920]   I'm not talking about that.
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:23.660]   I'm not talking about allowing sorrow and overwhelming, terrible emotions rule us.
[01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:26.460]   I'm not talking about that.
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:28.900]   Then you're not focusing on Christ's forgiveness.
[01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:34.660]   But I'm talking about being genuinely grieved in your heart over having done the sin to
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:38.540]   begin with.
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:45.460]   That's what we're talking about.
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:50.840]   Two really good examples about this in Scripture.
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:56.120]   For one, you've got David in Psalm 51 where he talks about "against thee and thee only
[01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:57.860]   have I sinned and done what is evil."
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:16:01.900]   You're like, "I don't think that's a really good English translation of that because the
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:06.500]   Hebrew terminology for the word "against" can also be translated "before."
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:10.260]   I think that would actually be a better translation, "before thee and thee only," because David
[01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:14.440]   knows that he had sinned against Bathsheba, he knew against…he had sinned against her
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:16.220]   husband Uriah.
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:24.160]   He knew that, not just against God, but before that he thought that this was a secret sin.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:28.840]   He thought before God and God only he had sinned until Nathan the prophet brought it
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:37.040]   into public view.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:44.640]   But it does serve to illustrate the fact that all of our sin is really a sin against God.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:50.280]   And then in 2 Corinthians chapter 7 verses 9 through 11, we looked at verse 10, he says,
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:54.720]   "I now rejoice not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to the point
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:58.260]   of repentance, for you were made sorrowful according to the will of God."
[01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:05.120]   So there was a genuine sorrow over what had been done according to the will of God.
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:15.080]   Now, you understand at this particular point that if there's going to be genuine reconciliation,
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:21.400]   then you have to go through the territory of genuine repentance.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:24.080]   You have to go through that.
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:31.480]   If you don't, and this is why very seldom, very seldom do Christians ever really truly
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.480]   reconcile.
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:38.920]   They kind of bring some kind of false peace between people, but they don't really reconcile
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:45.520]   because there is no willingness to set aside the pride at this particular point to genuinely
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:53.800]   repent and as a result of that just humble themselves before God and another person and
[01:17:53.800 --> 01:18:00.400]   seek to rebuild that relationship to where it was better than ever before, where it is
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.720]   completely and fully reconciled.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:12.640]   Now listen, at this particular point, I told you in this session, you had to put on your
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:17.600]   crash helmets and fasten your seat belts.
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:23.000]   I want you to bring your crash helmets and seat belts back to our next session along
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.400]   with a flak vest.
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.840]   All right?
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.280]   Are you ready?
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:34.840]   Because our next session, which will be tomorrow, you're going to need every one of them in
[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:37.840]   spades.
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:39.520]   Let's pray.
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:45.680]   Gracious Father, we thank You for Your goodness and Your grace towards us.
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.320]   Even while we were yet sinners, You died for us.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:52.480]   You humbled us.
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:19:02.240]   And Father, we should be grieved over the relationships that we have ruined in our lives
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:10.720]   because of our own pride, our own unwillingness to genuinely repent.
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:18.640]   I pray, Father, that You'll take us through the land of genuine repentance in order to
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:21.440]   get at reconciliation.
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.680]   This we pray in Christ's name.
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:24.680]   Amen.
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:33.680]   Let us all rise as we sing our closing praise.
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:20:02.680]   Now to see the dawn of the darkest day, Christ on the rooter calling.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:22.680]   Trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling,
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:51.680]   trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling,
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:21:17.680]   trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling,
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:46.680]   trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling, trampling,
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:53.860]   And torn His tomb Dead our race to lack
[01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:59.840]   Finished the victory cry
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.340]   This the power
[01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:08.960]   This the power of the cross
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:16.960]   Christ became Sent for us
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:23.960]   Took the blame For the wrath
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:30.960]   We stand forgiven at the cross
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:40.960]   O to see O to see my name
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:48.960]   Written in the wounds For through Your suffering
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:52.960]   I am free
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:23:00.960]   Death is crushed to death Life is mine to live
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:07.960]   Won through Your selfless love
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:15.960]   This the power Of the cross
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:23.960]   Son of God Slain for us
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:30.960]   What a life What a cost
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:36.960]   We stand forgiven at the cross
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:38.960]   This the power
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:46.960]   This the power of the cross
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:54.960]   Son of God Slain for us
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:24:00.960]   What a life What a cost
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:08.960]   We stand forgiven at the cross
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:16.960]   Let's pray together.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:22.520]   Heavenly Father, we want to take this moment as we sing that song to thank You, God, that
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:27.960]   You have brought us to repentance through Your mercy and grace and kindness.
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:30.960]   It leads us, Father God, to trust You with our entire lives.
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:35.720]   For we know, Lord, in the future there will come a time when You will cause every single
[01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:41.060]   man to submit themselves to You, but You will leave them in their hardened state.
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:47.440]   So Lord, help us, having seen Your grace, to fully entrust ourselves to You, relinquishing
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:48.440]   all things.
[01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:55.680]   And, Lord, sometimes we feel the hardness of our flesh and our hearts resisting, resisting
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:01.720]   feeling as bad as we are, justifying ourselves and not willing to either acknowledge what
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:07.320]   You have said, to come to points of humility, but we pray, Lord, that Your Spirit would
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:12.400]   guide us to that end, for we know that God, truly the greatest, most blessed place to
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.600]   be is under Your grace.
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:19.240]   Lord, we thank You, God, today it's in Christ and we pray, amen.
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.200]   Please take a seat.
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:26.920]   So at this time, what we're going to do is take what's called like a necessities break,
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:30.240]   aka PP break.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:36.160]   Just we're going to try to start our Q&A session shortly after.
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:40.560]   So just bare necessities, if you guys need to go and do a run, please go ahead and do
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:41.560]   that.
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:45.200]   But in about five minutes or so, we're going to start pulling people together and start
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:50.200]   the Q&A, which also means, A, you have a moment to submit more questions.
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:54.720]   I'm going to put my phone numbers on the Facebook group.
[01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:57.120]   We'll put it up on the screen as well.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:00.120]   And then we'll meet back here.
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:02.120]   I'm sorry, real fast, Jason, did you have an announcement?
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:03.120]   No, you're okay?
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:04.120]   All right.
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:06.560]   Everyone, we'll see everybody back in about five minutes.
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:16.560]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
