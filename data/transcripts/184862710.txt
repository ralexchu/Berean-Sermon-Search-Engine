[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.920]   Okay.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.340]   Okay.
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:22.760]   Alright.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.000]   Well, as we begin our second lesson,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.660]   I want to begin with
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.380]   just a quick review.
[00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.780]   Last time, Pastor Peter
[00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.780]   focused our study
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.600]   on the character of God and His holiness.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.440]   Okay?
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.380]   Just want to jog your memory a little bit
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.780]   and ask you,
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.520]   in what ways did He define
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.180]   that holiness to be?
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.120]   You know?
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.620]   I'm just going to go through a couple of lists here.
[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.140]   He mentioned that the holiness that God
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.640]   is described as,
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.480]   first and foremost,
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.240]   the definition we typically think of
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.840]   is that He is perfect in His morality.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.680]   Right?
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.900]   That there isn't evil in Him.
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.360]   That there isn't sin and wickedness in Him.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.500]   Right?
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.200]   But He elevated that by saying,
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.500]   it's not just that God is moral,
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.420]   but He is the standard of morality.
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.540]   He is the standard of perfection.
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.620]   Okay?
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.460]   Now,
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.940]   I'm not going to ask for volunteers,
[00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.780]   it's a big room,
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.220]   so just kind of getting you to think about,
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.500]   and then as He stated that God in His morality,
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.300]   or in His perfection,
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.640]   is the standard,
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.480]   He went on to talk about how God is truly unique.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.380]   That there is nobody like Him.
[00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.980]   And this uniqueness about God
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.440]   contributes to our understanding of how God is holy.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.280]   And what's more,
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.440]   as God is unique,
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.280]   and therefore,
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.500]   as the only one
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.240]   who truly has those character traits,
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.820]   He is priceless.
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.680]   There is this value innate with Him,
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.600]   which we would call glorious.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.440]   Okay?
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.560]   And then He used this term that God is weighty.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.240]   So just really quickly running down
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.960]   through some of these concepts,
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.360]   He is morally perfect.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.400]   He is the standard of perfection.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.680]   He is entirely unique.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.840]   And He is glorious and weighty.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.680]   Okay?
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.980]   Glorious and weighty.
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.600]   And those are concepts that,
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.480]   obviously,
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.040]   you and I are not going to exhaustively understand
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.880]   and be like,
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.960]   ah, that's exactly it.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.440]   A lot of that is transcended,
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.400]   and it's just beyond us.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.800]   But that causes us to just worship and be in awe
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.520]   of the fact that God is that holy.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.240]   However, today,
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.800]   as we make our transition into the topic
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.840]   that we're gonna be learning about today,
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.240]   when God,
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.960]   in His holiness,
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.940]   essentially appears
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.880]   and is revealed to us,
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.840]   there is a reaction.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.040]   Almost as two elements in chemistry,
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.400]   when, you know,
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.160]   introduced to each other would have a chemical reaction,
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.640]   there is a sense to which God in His holiness,
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.280]   as He appears and is present in this world,
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.320]   there is a reaction.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.200]   And that's really what I'm gonna be focusing on
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.080]   today's lesson.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.200]   The question primarily is,
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.560]   how does this holy God relate to mankind?
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.400]   Okay?
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.720]   How does this holy God relate to mankind?
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.960]   And the first thing I wanna say
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.920]   is this.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.440]   That as our God relates to man,
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.160]   He is, first and foremost,
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.680]   as the scripture reveals it to us,
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.880]   repulsed by sin.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.880]   Aw, man.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.360]   I need 20 of these points for us to post
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.160]   to come up one by one.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.760]   Now they're all up there.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.160]   [laughing]
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.000]   Okay.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.820]   Well, well, bam.
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.360]   There it is, okay?
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.400]   So here are gonna be my points.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.960]   Now, I was trying to use my words carefully.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.880]   I mean, we don't really use the word like,
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.200]   aw, you repulsed me, you know?
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.920]   But what do we mean by that?
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.360]   Is,
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.080]   as there was such an intense emphasis,
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.960]   okay, first and foremost,
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.120]   as there was such an intense emphasis of God's holiness
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.000]   in the scriptures of the Old Testament,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.400]   when I look through the Old Testament,
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.720]   and particularly, there's gonna be some
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.800]   digging into the book of Leviticus,
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.240]   there has been a contrasting emphasis on sin.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.680]   And for, again, we don't use the word often,
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.840]   but how sin is so repulsive to the Lord.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.080]   I wanna begin by saying this.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.760]   That the book of Leviticus, when you read it through,
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.080]   you will find that the word sin
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.720]   is used so many times,
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.360]   as a matter of fact, it's used 194 times.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.240]   Can you imagine that?
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.000]   And there is this emphasis, not just on,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.400]   you know, the general concept of sin,
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.840]   but there is an emphasis on the various kinds of sin.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.680]   Okay?
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.240]   There's an emphasis on the various kinds of sin.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.080]   What do I mean by that?
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.960]   In the book of Leviticus,
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.840]   God is not just generally saying,
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.640]   ah, there is this general concept of sin.
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.520]   He is almost meticulous,
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.360]   describing every category of sin.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.680]   He describes various categories of sin,
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.080]   such as sins that are of being defiled,
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.200]   sins that are of uncleanness or blemishes.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.880]   There are sins that are of the heart,
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.920]   such as wicked intent, evil,
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.320]   and then there are sins of rebellion and transgression.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.240]   There are unintentional sins,
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.760]   there are intentional sins,
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.320]   there are weighty sins.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.200]   I mean, he goes through the full gamut
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.440]   of all the different kinds of sins.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.280]   Okay?
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.680]   And the reason why I think,
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.680]   you know, when you think about that,
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.360]   somebody, when somebody is starting to tell you
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.380]   and trying to define for you what something is,
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.760]   but they're able to tell you
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.040]   what that is in all its different contexts.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.380]   Categorically tell you where all that fits.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.040]   Now there's an emphasis on what that definition is.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.960]   But what's more,
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.120]   there's an emphasis on everyone's sin.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.960]   Okay?
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.840]   And what do I mean by that?
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.720]   For your devotional passages,
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.200]   I had you guys look at Leviticus chapter 16.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.440]   And if you're able to quickly turn there
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.520]   to Leviticus chapter 16,
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.280]   I'm gonna read verses,
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.120]   let's see here.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.040]   Give me one second,
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.520]   I wanna hit the right verse.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.420]   Okay.
[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.360]   Turner, with you?
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:14.600]   There's a really important verse here,
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.240]   starting from verse 16.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.800]   Okay?
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.640]   It says this,
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.240]   "Thus he shall make atonement for the holy place
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.080]   "because of the uncleanness of the people of Israel
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.540]   "and because of their transgressions,
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.160]   "because of their transgressions, all their sins.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.820]   "And so he shall do for the tent of meeting
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.520]   "which dwells with them in the midst
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.880]   "of their uncleanliness."
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.720]   Okay?
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.540]   And then verse seven says,
[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.300]   "No one may be in the tent of meeting
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.160]   "from the time he enters to make atonement
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.620]   "in the holy place until he comes out
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.680]   "and has made atonement for himself,
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.040]   "for his house, and for all the assembly of Israel."
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.960]   Do you see that?
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.240]   What I'm highlighting there is this is,
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.000]   everyone from the priest himself,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.640]   then his household,
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.080]   and then the whole nation.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.720]   There is this concentric circle
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.440]   that continues to expound.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.000]   And what he's talking about is from you, the holy guy,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.980]   you know, the one anointed and set apart,
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.380]   to his whole extended family,
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.500]   and then to the nation.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.540]   Everybody needs to be cleansed.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.380]   Why?
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.660]   Because there is uncleanliness in all of you.
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.340]   And what's more, so there's a sense then
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.540]   which when I emphasize this idea of everybody's sin,
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.900]   think about how pervasive that sin is.
[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.700]   That he says, even as he describes this tabernacle,
[00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.340]   the whole house must be cleansed.
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.900]   Okay?
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.940]   So, there is emphasis on,
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.960]   just by the fact that the number of time he talks about it,
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.000]   about the various kinds of sin,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.880]   and how that sin is pervasive in everybody.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.880]   And then, God describes that sin's effect everywhere.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.320]   Okay?
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.640]   And we're gonna talk more about that,
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.920]   but I just want to make mention of this fact,
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.120]   that when you think of the book of Leviticus,
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.880]   what you'll find is just that there's so many rules
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.520]   and regulations, right?
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.240]   So typically, at the start of the new year,
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.840]   people say like, "I'm gonna read the Bible."
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.420]   They get through Genesis, you know, Exodus,
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.580]   and then when they get to Leviticus,
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.180]   it's just like, "What in the world?"
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.860]   And there's just tons of little laws and regulations
[00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.300]   that's very hard to come by.
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.180]   I want to help you categorize that by saying,
[00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.660]   sin's effect is so pervasive,
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.860]   it has affected everything.
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.220]   From the animals, from their house,
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.900]   from their tents of meeting.
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.980]   Sin's effect has been decaying the whole world,
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.800]   and so in Romans, it talks about how this entire generation
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.880]   and the world in its creation
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.140]   is groaning under this sin's decay.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.400]   So, what I'm kind of presenting to you is,
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.960]   just as there was this emphasis
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.640]   on why we need to understand the holiness of God,
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.320]   we know that there has to be a contrasting emphasis
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.280]   of understanding our sin.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.040]   And this is just reality, the spiritual reality
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.920]   that we're blind to and we don't know
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.320]   before we meet Christ,
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.200]   before we know the truth.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.440]   But it's so vital that in contrast to God's glory,
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.420]   there is an understanding of the weight of sin.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:21.180]   Now, the point that I made with this first section
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.800]   is not only that God is pointing out sin.
[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.960]   All right, aw.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.000]   Okay, is anybody back there?
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.600]   Okay, well, you're looking on as on your sheets, right?
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.440]   Maybe I'll,
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.840]   okay, yeah, I don't wanna distract us with that.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.300]   So, as you're looking on on your sheets,
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.740]   maybe I'll just kinda go along here, okay?
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.640]   The point that I was making is not just the fact
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.120]   that God points sin and is like, there it is.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.440]   The idea that I was trying to get us to think about
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.480]   is the fact that in God's presence,
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.680]   he is repulsed by sin.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.320]   He rejects sin, right?
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.720]   Scripture says that he casts sin away.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.560]   So, there's a passage in Leviticus, chapter 22.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.400]   You don't have to turn there.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.800]   I'll read this for us.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.880]   Leviticus, chapter 22, starting from verse two to three,
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.020]   it says this.
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.440]   God commands and says, "Say to them,
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.380]   "if anyone of all your offsprings
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.920]   "throughout your generations," okay?
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.560]   So, not just anybody here,
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.080]   but everybody from here forward in all your generations,
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.880]   "approaches the holy things that the people of Israel
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.060]   "dedicate to the Lord while he has uncleanness,
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.940]   "that person shall be cut off from my presence.
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.640]   "I am the Lord."
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.740]   There is this automatic expulsion, right?
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.720]   There's a rejection.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.020]   If there is uncleanness, there is reproach,
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.960]   there is disgust.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.160]   And that's what I'm emphasizing.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.460]   Can I say this?
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.000]   Maybe you've heard, you know,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.560]   maybe you've heard like, oh, we're just dust of the ground.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.400]   Right?
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.960]   Maybe you've heard we are low because we're sinners.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.860]   But truthfully, from the Scriptures,
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.840]   we're worse than that, right?
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.440]   The way Scripture describes us through the words of God,
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.280]   God is trying to show them
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.480]   that there is this uncleanness like mold,
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.800]   like fungus, like dead carcasses.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.560]   And sin is described in such a way
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.520]   where it is detestable, abominations.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.560]   And the kind of words that are used is really shocking.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.760]   It's really eye-opening.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.280]   You know, there was a time
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.080]   when our church was doing Korean barbecues.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.600]   You know, some of you guys who used to do that.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.900]   It was hard work and stuff,
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:42.360]   and we used to make huge batches of rice and meat
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.200]   and stuff like that.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.380]   And after each barbecue,
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.560]   we typically have a whole lot left over.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.960]   What ended up happening is, you know,
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.480]   because at the time, when I was like a single guy,
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.360]   or whatever, we would take most of the leftovers home.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.560]   One time, we brought home an entire cooler of rice.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.520]   So imagine just like one of your big coolers,
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.920]   and it's just filled with rice.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.320]   Sometimes you get lazy to clean that stuff.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.800]   And there was this time when all of a sudden,
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.120]   like everybody in my apartment
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.040]   started to smell something funky.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.040]   And we all kind of had, in the back of our minds,
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.800]   like, oh my God, we forgot to clean that stuff, right?
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.360]   So we got there and opened, and we're like,
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.640]   oh, what is that?
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.240]   'Cause it gets all colorful, right?
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.340]   I made a mistake because I left it open,
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.280]   and then I ran away.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.800]   Within just like a day or two,
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.640]   it's crazy how vibrantly colorful rice can get.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.880]   It's white, but if you guys have ever had rice mold,
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.120]   and it mold progressively,
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.120]   somebody's like nodding their head, okay?
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.080]   When we think of mold, you typically think like,
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.440]   oh, it's the green mold.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.800]   No, no, no, no, rice can mold,
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.800]   and then there'll be like pink stuff.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.160]   There'll be black stuff.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.680]   And then there's gonna be like fuzzy white stuff.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.960]   And then it gets even worse and worse after that.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.080]   And the thing about it is when we went outside,
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.000]   like the stench was so bad, we would smell it,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.720]   and then be like, no, I can't clean it, man.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.680]   And we'd run back inside,
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.680]   but we felt like the stench was like chasing us, you know?
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.000]   It's like following us outside and all that kind of stuff.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.880]   It was so bad, we had to throw the entire cooler away.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.840]   You know?
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.040]   It was so crazy.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.080]   And the stuff that was growing inside,
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.160]   obviously, like there was like moving maggots,
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.800]   and it was just getting gross.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.840]   Now, I'm going at length to describe this to you
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.880]   because of this.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.160]   God, through his command,
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.920]   he was teaching the nation.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.240]   He was teaching them,
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.200]   I wanna give you rules about animals and dead carcasses.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.520]   And I wanna show you what is unclean versus clean.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.400]   I'm gonna show you based on animals
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.640]   and things with blemish
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.120]   to show you what's clean versus unclean.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.360]   I wanna show you through rituals, sacrifice, drama,
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.640]   through the people, through the buildings.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.720]   He would talk about examples such as this.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.920]   There would be examples of animals,
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.680]   about different forms of animals.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.440]   There'd be examples of gnats.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.640]   There'd be examples of mold in the house.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.480]   I wanna read you some of these things.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.320]   In chapter 11, verse 44 to 45,
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.800]   again, for the sake of time, I'll read it for us.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.240]   It says this, "I am the Lord your God."
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.280]   He begins with his character.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.240]   He says, "Consecrate for yourself therefore,
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.920]   "and be holy because I am holy.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.700]   "You shall not defile yourself with any swarming thing
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.080]   "that crawls on the ground,
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.740]   "for I am the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:25.840]   "to be your God.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.320]   "You shall therefore be holy for I am holy."
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.080]   And then he gives the example of a house
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.900]   when there's green or colorful mold
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.720]   that they scrape everything off,
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.440]   they throw it outside the camp,
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.480]   and then the priest comes over, takes blood,
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.200]   and then he anoints the house.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.780]   What does an animal that swarms on the ground
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.700]   have to do with holiness?
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.600]   What does sprinkling blood on the walls
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.960]   have to do with mold?
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.560]   God is teaching them.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.800]   This is what's holy, this is what's unholy.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.840]   This is what's clean, this is what's unclean.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.920]   And there must be a recognition by the people.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.200]   There has to be an ability to distinguish.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.040]   By those people who God calls as his people,
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.260]   they have to be able to tell what is clean versus unclean.
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.680]   There is a very pivotal passage
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.840]   that comes from Leviticus chapter 16, verse 10.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.880]   You can jot that down.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.120]   Jot that down as a passage reference.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.960]   Leviticus chapter 16, verse 10,
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.360]   where God says to them,
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.740]   you are to distinguish between the holy and the common,
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.960]   between the unclean and the clean.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.840]   Because I was preparing for this study tonight,
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.240]   that's why I preached what I preached on Sunday.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:51.080]   I was so convicted that for people who say they know God,
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.400]   that means they have to have a light shine on them,
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.920]   that means they have to have truth,
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.520]   and the teaching of God given to them
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.200]   so that they can tell what's clean and unclean,
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.720]   so that they know the difference between left and right.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.920]   And then there is this moment,
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.600]   and then there is this pivotal recognition,
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.060]   epiphany as you would put it.
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:20.040]   As God is teaching them through the rituals and sacrifices
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.800]   of what is clean and unclean,
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.920]   that the people would realize, I'm unclean.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.000]   I'm detestable.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.120]   Because if there's anything that these sacrifices
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.680]   are showing, that what cannot enter
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.640]   into the presence of God,
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.440]   it is anything that is unclean,
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.080]   but what's really been represented,
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.760]   what's really been covered with blood,
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.560]   what's really been going through the drama is them.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:51.160]   And there has to be an oh my goodness,
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.280]   through all this God is showing us,
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.040]   I am the one who is unclean.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.600]   And now this world might say something like,
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.520]   well, God hates the sin, but not the sinner.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.580]   But the truth of the matter is the book of Leviticus
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.520]   teaches us men die at the altar,
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.240]   because God judges both sin and the one who sins.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.000]   Because the one, the man who offers,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.560]   the man who enters into his presence,
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.880]   the man who sinned is himself unclean.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.680]   That's one of the biggest lessons that we realize
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.560]   from the book of Leviticus.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.360]   That's one of the biggest lessons that God is teaching us
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.080]   through all of that in history.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.440]   And so as we see again, the character of God,
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.280]   and how he is repulsed by sin and sinners,
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.640]   we realize that there's such a contrast and discrepancy,
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.800]   and God highlights it by pointing out
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.460]   that he is going to judge such sin.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.980]   So we move to number two,
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.080]   where when we ask the question, how does God relate to man?
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.520]   And we wanna make this statement,
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:01.440]   that God requires and demands holiness because he is holy.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.480]   So in answering the question, how does God relate to man,
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.000]   we wanna answer with number two by saying,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.960]   he demands holiness.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.040]   God knows we are sinners, God knows we're unclean,
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.040]   God knows we're incapable, but he demands holiness
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.640]   from anything and anyone that approaches him.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.680]   Anything in his presence, he requires that it be cleansed,
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.760]   because he himself is holy.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.160]   And so I don't know how else to put it,
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.680]   except that God's standard is God's standard.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.660]   We're gonna do a quick exercise here.
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:37.920]   I wanna highlight that when God's command is given,
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:44.240]   God gives, in some ways, commands based upon a certain tag,
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.120]   a repetition by which he's emphasizing a truth,
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.640]   and what he says is this, you shall be holy because
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.760]   I am holy, because I am God.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.240]   For example, I'm gonna read some of these passages.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:01.280]   The Leviticus 19, verse 17 one, you guys know well,
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.280]   because some of you guys have memorized it,
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.480]   and it's a short statement.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.020]   He just simply says, be holy as I am holy.
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.120]   What's more, I'm gonna read to us Leviticus 18,
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.400]   'cause I read the chapter 11 earlier.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.120]   Leviticus 18, verse four through five,
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.520]   he says, you are to perform my judgments,
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.660]   keep my statutes, to live in accord with them.
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.400]   I am the Lord your God.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.520]   So you shall keep my statutes and my judgments
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:28.000]   by which a man may live if he does them.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.680]   I am the Lord your God.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.600]   So what essentially is happening is,
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.080]   God is relating to the individuals,
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.880]   and he's teaching them that they're sinful,
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.480]   and there's a sense in which, perhaps,
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:46.480]   if you think about it, of what we maybe assume of God,
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.560]   that he might give some conditions.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.520]   He might give some, what you would call, handicaps.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.160]   He might give some leniency.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.000]   He might give some X, Y, or Z.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.280]   But what's surprising about the book of Leviticus,
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.960]   all the Old Testament, and how God operates is,
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.640]   God's standard is God's standard,
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.600]   and it never gets diminished.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.240]   I want you just to take a moment
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.800]   and think about that standard, right?
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.000]   Be holy 'cause I am holy.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.720]   Abide by all of my statutes.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.080]   I am the Lord, God's standard of himself
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.480]   is being posed to these sinful people,
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.360]   and then he warns them, should you fail,
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.760]   you will be judged, right?
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:34.840]   So, I wanna give a couple of these passages as well.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.440]   A couple of these passages as well,
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.240]   kind of deriving it from chapter 26.
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.840]   I had you guys read chapter 26.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:44.880]   Let me see if this thing's working.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.600]   Thanks for clicking it for me.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.440]   It's not, okay.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.960]   From chapter 26, you guys can turn your Bibles there,
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.000]   'cause let's take a look at that passage.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.760]   Okay, please turn your Bibles to Leviticus chapter 26.
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.500]   And my train of thought and reasoning is this.
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.160]   There is something contrary to maybe
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.120]   what typically we would expect.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.680]   God is showing us that we are sinful.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.600]   We're clearly very far from his standard,
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.760]   but yet still, God's standard does not change,
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.000]   because God's standard is God's standard.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.280]   And then, God warns them, should you fail,
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.160]   you will be judged.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.640]   And in very alarming, very sobering words,
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.020]   this is what God says.
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.360]   So, chapter 26, verse 18 says this.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.600]   And if in spite of this, you will not listen to me,
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:41.200]   then I will discipline you again sevenfold for your sins.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.240]   Verse 24.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.280]   Then I also will walk contrary to you,
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:50.360]   and I myself will strike you sevenfold for your sins.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.640]   Then I will walk contrary to, sorry, and then verse 28.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.800]   Then I will walk contrary to you in fury,
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.140]   and I myself will discipline you sevenfold for your sins.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.680]   And the reason why I read those things
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.640]   is because it is sobering, isn't it?
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:10.560]   I mean, it's sobering for us to hear those words like,
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.640]   if even after all this explanation,
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.880]   and all this teaching, you sin,
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.040]   I will judge you sevenfold.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.000]   It's like, wow.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.600]   And then he says, I will stand contrary to you,
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.640]   and then he says, I will stand contrary to you in fury.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.800]   Right?
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.640]   It's escalated, it's elevated.
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.320]   And it's an incredibly sobering thing,
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.520]   and this stands, again, in such stark contrast
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.760]   to perhaps how we think about things.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.920]   You know what's something interesting
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.840]   in the way that we think?
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.220]   Is that there's a lot of times
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.680]   in which we understand that truth,
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.000]   I cannot bring holiness to the table and altar of God.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.520]   Right?
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.440]   And in moments when we sin,
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.960]   there are times when we say something
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.720]   to the extent of, yeah, you know,
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.280]   and we all know, and already know,
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.960]   that we couldn't have obtained righteousness
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.000]   and approval by God by our merit anyways.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.400]   Right?
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.840]   But then, all of a sudden,
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.500]   that transitions and changes
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.280]   into something altogether different.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.800]   It changes into, like, an excuse.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.500]   And so, therefore, that's why I am just the way I am.
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.600]   And then, that somehow, in this day and age,
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.960]   and perhaps a lot of times in our own private lives,
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.440]   and the way that we think,
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.380]   it not only turns into an excuse,
[00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:29.200]   but it turns into a presumption.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.520]   It turns into a presumption about God's standard
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.080]   and says something to the extent of,
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.640]   and therefore, God's gonna be okay with it.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.380]   And God always still accepts me.
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.200]   But the fact of the matter is
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.360]   that the idea and truth that we are sinners
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.920]   is a wake-up call of reality.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.640]   It says nothing about how we are excused,
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.920]   and it says nothing about the standard of God.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.600]   Rather, the rest of scripture informs us
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.720]   the standard of God is still up here,
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.640]   and yet you are still sinful.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:02.480]   Do you see what I'm saying?
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.400]   When we, in our lives,
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.920]   start learning the doctrines of grace,
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.640]   and we know that statement of truth,
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.680]   where we say, "Righteousness cannot be earned by my works,"
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.000]   that is absolutely true,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.080]   but that states nothing about God's standard.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.600]   It just simply gives us the reality that we are sinful.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.840]   And so, those individuals who use that statement
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.960]   as a means by way of excusing them,
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.060]   or presuming God's gonna just naturally accept them,
[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.280]   they don't understand the standard of God.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.320]   And I'd go as far as to say
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.880]   they don't actually understand how sinful they are.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.720]   Right?
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:42.800]   Now, the examples of this that Pastor Peter gave last week
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.880]   are the people like Nadab and Behu.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.000]   You know what they were guilty of?
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.440]   They were guilty of the sin of presumption.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.340]   Scripture says that when you offer something before God,
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.540]   and then you know that it's blemished,
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:00.900]   you know that it's not perfect,
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.500]   and you know that's not the standard of God,
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.660]   but you put it there anyway, do you know what you do?
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:08.460]   You assume that the table of God is contemptible.
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.980]   You assume God is okay with subpar.
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.040]   You assume God is okay.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:19.060]   And that is the sin of Nadab and Behu, the sons of Aaron.
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.460]   And what's really crazy about that
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.500]   is when God judges Nadab and Behu,
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.260]   and the fire comes out of the altar
[00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:28.340]   and immediately judges them, and they die.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.220]   Just to show all the nation, and just to show Aaron
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:35.620]   that God's standard is righteous, do you know what God says?
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.060]   He looks over at Aaron and says,
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.120]   "I don't want you to weep, wail, or say a word.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:44.060]   "I want you to accept this as right."
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.340]   Because, and then he describes,
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:50.840]   "Because at his temple, he will be regarded as holy."
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.740]   That's so sobering.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.020]   If you would please turn your Bibles
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.460]   to Malachi chapter one, verse six through 14,
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.400]   this is another just sobering passage of scripture.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:08.060]   Something that just naturally causes us to evaluate
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:11.180]   where we are, what we're doing,
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.980]   and what we're offering up as a sacrifice,
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.380]   what we're offering up as worship before God.
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.460]   Addressing this whole topic that I'm talking about
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.900]   of not being presumptuous before the Lord,
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.020]   this is what the scripture says.
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.460]   Again, Malachi chapter one, verse six through 14.
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:33.380]   A son honors his father, and a servant his master.
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.500]   Then if I am a father, where is my honor?
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.380]   And if I am a master, where is my respect?
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.300]   Says the Lord of hosts to you.
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.540]   Oh, priest who despise my name,
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.420]   but you say, "How have we despised your name?
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:49.380]   "You are presenting defiled food upon my altar."
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.300]   But you say, "How have we defiled you?"
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:56.620]   In that you say, "The table of the Lord is to be despised."
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.780]   But when you present the blind for sacrifice,
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.260]   is that not evil?
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.460]   And when you present the lame and sick, is that not evil?
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.300]   Why not offer it to your governor?
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.060]   Would he be pleased with you?
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.080]   Or would he receive you kindly, says the Lord of hosts?
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.420]   But now, will you not entreat God's favor,
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.320]   that he may be gracious to us?
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.100]   With such an offering on your part,
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:20.060]   will he receive any of you kindly, says the Lord of hosts?
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.600]   Oh, that there were one among you who would shut the gates,
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.860]   that you might not uselessly kindle fire on my altar.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.140]   I am not pleased with you, says the Lord of hosts,
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.300]   nor will I accept an offering from you.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.580]   For from the rising of the sun, even to its setting,
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.860]   my name will be great among the nations.
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.180]   In every place, incense is going to be offered to my name.
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.800]   And a grain offering that is pure for my name
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.340]   will be great among the nations, says the Lord of hosts.
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.860]   But you are profaning it, in that you say
[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:48.980]   the table of the Lord is defiled.
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.020]   And as for its fruits, its food is to be despised.
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:56.260]   You also say, my, how tiresome it is.
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:59.740]   And you disdainfully sniff at it, says the Lord of hosts.
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.580]   And you bring what is taken by robbery
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.200]   and what is lame or sick, so you bring the offering.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.080]   Should I receive that from your hands, says the Lord?
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.540]   But cursed be the swindler who has a male in his flock
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:13.180]   and vows it, but sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord.
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:16.100]   For I am a great king, says the Lord of hosts.
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.140]   And my name is feared among the nations.
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:25.540]   Dang, doesn't that just cause us to take a moment and think?
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:30.080]   If ever we've griped and complained,
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.260]   like why do I have to do this in church service?
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.620]   Why does it have to be like that and it's inconvenient?
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.420]   And why, and then all of a sudden,
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.740]   every expectation and standard that we feel
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.860]   from the church, from the people, from the pastor,
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:46.980]   from the word, all of a sudden becomes burden to us.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.360]   And then, if we've ever succumbed to that burden
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.660]   and then started to reduce our standard,
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.160]   and just to simply assume, God is gracious,
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.860]   maybe God is far, does God even see this stuff?
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:04.000]   And then you start to offer things that are to you,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.700]   not even priority, not to you,
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.020]   even not even their best efforts.
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.420]   Does the scripture say God's standard all of a sudden
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.100]   has been lowered because we're in the New Testament?
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.860]   Does the scripture say that God has changed
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.020]   because all of a sudden we're in the New Testament?
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.340]   Does the scripture say that God's holiness
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.340]   not all of a sudden become diminished
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.500]   because God simply understands our sin?
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.820]   No, God's standard is God's standard.
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.540]   And the way that God, the holy God, deals with his people
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.860]   is he demands perfection.
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.080]   He demands holiness.
[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.140]   That is the truth of scripture.
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.980]   God does not simply say, I understand, it's all right,
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.060]   everybody tries.
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:50.100]   That is not the way scripture talks.
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:55.380]   But at this point, if you're feeling a sense of like, dang.
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:58.420]   If you're feeling a sense of like, dang,
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.120]   so what can we do?
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.480]   If you are feeling a sense of at a loss,
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.940]   like, oh my gosh, that is the standard of God,
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.520]   that is absolutely appropriate.
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:12.420]   'Cause that is where the gospel places us.
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:16.660]   We are in a place of being completely lost.
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:18.380]   But we don't know what to do.
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:21.120]   How do we approach the holy God
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.980]   who is holiest of all holies?
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:27.780]   And how do we, as sinners who are so wretched,
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.420]   unclean, and sinful, and defiled, approach God?
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:31.940]   We can't.
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.460]   And so all the book of Leviticus is telling you,
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:35.900]   can't come here, can't come here,
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.580]   don't even come close to the mountain,
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.140]   don't even come close to the cloud,
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.020]   don't even touch, don't even do this,
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:43.020]   don't even do that, because you can't.
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:46.100]   And so thanks be to God,
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.300]   because even in the book of Leviticus,
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.780]   Old Testament book of Leviticus,
[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:54.100]   there is that truth presented to us
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:58.380]   in a context of grace, in a context of love.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.060]   And that's my next point,
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:03.480]   which is how does the holy God relate to man?
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:07.280]   By teaching us the way of atonement.
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:10.780]   By teaching us the way of atonement.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.220]   Again, I know we're flipping around
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.540]   lots of different passages in the book of Leviticus,
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:17.980]   but I just wanted to show you
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.860]   that this is not just like one verse, or like one theme,
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:25.500]   it's just such a profound, major thrust
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.020]   of everything that's happening in the Old Testament.
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.400]   But take a look at this, chapter 16, verse one through three.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.380]   Chapter 16, verse one through three.
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:40.100]   And he says this, I had you guys read this passage,
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.140]   but I'm just gonna read verse one through three.
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.500]   And it says this, the Lord spoke to Moses
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.860]   after the death of the two sons of Aaron,
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.440]   Nadab and Abihu, okay?
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.180]   Their death actually set like a precedence
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:54.940]   for how the people were supposed to come before God.
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.460]   And then he says this, when they drew near
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:01.220]   before the Lord and died, and the Lord said to Moses,
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.580]   tell Aaron your brother not to come at any time
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.860]   into the holy place inside the veil
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.020]   before the mercy seat that is in the ark,
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:11.540]   so that he may not die, okay?
[00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:15.620]   For I will appear in the cloud over the mercy seat,
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:20.620]   but in this way, Aaron shall come into the holy place.
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.740]   And in my Bible, and in my notes,
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:26.760]   I've highlighted in circle with a little heart this way.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.020]   Okay?
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.520]   Because when God is telling Aaron, you can't come in,
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:35.500]   because if I allowed you, if I didn't say stop,
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.140]   you would have died.
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.000]   That's God's grace.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.660]   And then by God's saying, and in this way,
[00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:46.180]   you shall approach me, that is the profound grace of God,
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:50.100]   teaching them that during this time, during this era,
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.540]   this is the way by which Aaron is going to approach
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:55.020]   the holy God towards his what?
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.260]   Mercy seat.
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.740]   And it was supposed to be so clear
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.660]   to all the nation of Israel.
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:06.100]   Chapter 16 is a profound chapter of the entire Bible, why?
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:09.580]   Because this is the chapter on the day of atonement.
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:11.940]   The day of the atonement for the nation of Israel
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:16.940]   is the greatest, the holiest, most profound day of all.
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.340]   If you guys have Jewish friends,
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:19.740]   they disappeared during what?
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.340]   Yom Kippur, okay?
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.960]   Yom means day, Kippur means atonement.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:28.360]   It's the day of atonement in which God has given them
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:32.480]   this profound way by which they would sacrifice
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.520]   and they would atone for their sins.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.480]   There is a need then for us to pay attention
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.920]   and ask this question, what does atonement really mean?
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:41.760]   Okay?
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.560]   Atonement means in scripture,
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.640]   to simply make amends or to make right.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.340]   That is just a simple definition.
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:54.400]   But symbolically, there has been so much
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.480]   that's been taught to the nation of Israel
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.400]   in terms of what atonement means.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.900]   You guys know the various, there's been like,
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.360]   there's five major sacrifices in the book of Leviticus
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:08.920]   and then on top of that, there are lots of descriptions
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.220]   about each one of those sacrifices.
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.200]   The main description is the pre-common ones
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:16.800]   come from a sacrifice of the sin offering, okay?
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.320]   Of the sin offering.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.200]   And the whole offering.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:22.440]   And the description about that, as you guys know,
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.280]   is just the sacrifice of the animal.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.720]   And then the lifeblood of that animal that is spilled
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:32.520]   covers, covers everything, right?
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:38.560]   The term atonement in the Hebrew is figuratively to cover.
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.120]   And the way that it comes about essentially is to say,
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.600]   how do we reconcile that distinction and contrast
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:48.080]   between the holy God and the sinful man?
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.040]   There needs to be covering.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.280]   There needs to be a covering of the sinful individual
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.440]   in order that God may enter into his presence.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:58.160]   But what's more, what's more,
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.340]   included in the idea of atonement,
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:04.040]   there is this term, propitiation, okay?
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.360]   Propitiation.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.780]   And this is where I wanna take a little bit of time.
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:09.080]   Just a little bit of time.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:16.040]   There is a concept that's gonna hit us a little bit weird.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.600]   And that concept I'm talking about
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.240]   is the idea of appeasing God.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.360]   Essentially, if you could imagine two individuals
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.720]   who are in an argument or a fight,
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.080]   and then something incredibly offensive happens, right?
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:33.960]   Typically, even when guys fight, even when brothers fight,
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.840]   nobody ever slaps each other in the face.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:40.540]   'Cause to hit the face is like disrespect, you know?
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.000]   It's offensive.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.440]   But if you would imagine something like that, okay?
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.840]   Imagine something like that.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.440]   And where an offense has happened.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.340]   And then one individual gets incredibly angry.
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:54.380]   What needs to happen, right?
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:59.200]   If an individual's incredibly angry or bitter, right?
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.040]   What needs to happen is that person's anger
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.280]   needs to be pacified or appeased.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.220]   Now, the reason why I say we might not like that idea
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:12.220]   is because that idea sounds a lot like pagan gods, you know?
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:16.120]   The Greek gods, or the gods of some Eastern religions
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.280]   or whatever it may be.
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.200]   Like there is this unpredictable, angry god,
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.440]   and then his anger has to be dealt with.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.840]   So you do crazy stuff like sacrifice a bunch of animals,
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.640]   and you sacrifice all this stuff, right?
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:35.580]   Now, I'm not gonna say that God's anger
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.480]   and the way that we're supposed to approach God
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.040]   is just a simplistic thing where it's one-faceted.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.080]   But one clear facet that the Bible says
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.200]   is in terms of that appeasement of God,
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.060]   it's absolutely true.
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:55.740]   Meaning, there is a wrath and anger of God
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:37:00.480]   that is fiery and burning and is waiting to be poured out.
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:04.840]   And there is a truth and fact of the matter
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:09.060]   that you need to deal and appease that anger, right?
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:13.640]   That is something that perhaps oftentimes escapes us,
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.740]   but that is at the core of what it means
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:18.040]   to atone for sin.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.560]   That in you making it right,
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.400]   in you rectifying the situation,
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.580]   you are dealing with the anger of God, right?
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:28.200]   And so this is why I think it's super important,
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.400]   as I connect the dots a little bit,
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:32.520]   is because perhaps a lot of times in our day,
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.360]   when we think about our sin,
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.520]   when we think about our shortcomings,
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.360]   oftentimes we deal with it in terms of our pain,
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.380]   our hurt, our suffering.
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:42.960]   When we think about our sins,
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.220]   we start to think about it in terms of
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.860]   other categories and contexts without connecting it
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.660]   as though God is displeased with that sin.
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.860]   Am I making sense?
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.020]   If I can say this as clear as possible,
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:01.300]   you're dealing with your sin,
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.580]   you're dealing with your guilt for your sin,
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:06.140]   you're dealing with your shame for your sin.
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:08.860]   It is not the people, it is not your church,
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:09.920]   it is not your family,
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.940]   it is definitely not you and your standards.
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:17.340]   You and your sins has to do with God's displeasure.
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.180]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.980]   It has to do with God's anger, God's wrath,
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:23.540]   it has to do with God.
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:28.780]   But so many times we miss that point.
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:30.780]   And I use this analogy all the time.
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:35.260]   I use this analogy with Catholics and people who struggle
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:39.220]   with trying to work, trying to do something,
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.720]   trying to just simply do self-improvement.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:43.980]   And I essentially say this,
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.820]   given that same example of a fight
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.380]   or some kind of conflict between two people,
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:52.260]   if you slap me and you offend me
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:54.420]   and then you disrespect my wife,
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:57.660]   you talk ill of Bia and you disrespect my kids,
[00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:01.220]   maybe you punked them around in the nursery or something.
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.180]   And then you come back the next week and you say,
[00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:07.140]   but Pastor Mark, I listened to your sermon, it was so good.
[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:12.000]   If you say, but Pastor Mark, I serve snacks,
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.160]   I'm gonna look you square in the eye and say,
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.160]   what does that have to do with you and me?
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.800]   And what happened between you and me, right?
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:24.400]   But that is a lot of times what happens for Christians,
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.080]   and especially those individuals, let's say,
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.560]   who are given, who aren't Christian,
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.960]   who are in the Catholic faith struggling so hard
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.040]   to work out something to appease God.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.680]   That's not the way it works.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:42.720]   And so, this is kind of a weird way to wrap things up,
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.720]   but I wanna wrap it up with this.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:48.880]   In asking the question about how does God deal with man,
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:54.040]   we realize there is a huge dilemma, right?
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:58.520]   This is an essential part of the truth that we believe.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:02.960]   This is an essential element of the story of redemption
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:05.960]   that we are called to understand.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.520]   There is an incredible dilemma
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.960]   where the holy God who is absolutely powerful
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:16.960]   is repelled by us, rejects us because of our sin,
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.440]   and we who are so defiled and unclean,
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.200]   we're incapable of drawing even an inch
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.220]   to the holiness of the Lord.
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.420]   Oh, what a dilemma.
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:29.960]   And regardless of what we try, regardless of what we say,
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.520]   there's an element by which even what we do and say
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:36.060]   is still producing more stain and uncleanliness.
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:39.360]   So what are we supposed to do?
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.760]   How are we supposed to bridge that gap?
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.100]   What do we do with that kind of animosity?
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.640]   And this is where we can look to the gospel of Christ
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.640]   and say, thank you so much, Lord,
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:53.000]   because to all and every of those questions,
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.440]   we find the answer yes in Christ, amen?
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.140]   That is to the depth and degree
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:01.280]   that we're supposed to be grateful for the work of Christ
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:05.400]   in both covering, in both appeasing and propitiating,
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.200]   in both satisfying the demand of God,
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.680]   in both transforming and sanctifying,
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:14.400]   and in revealing to us the greater glory of God
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.560]   by which we cannot see on our own accord, amen?
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.960]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:30.400]   Lord God, we took just an hour to talk about
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.040]   what you've been trying to teach the nation
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:34.300]   for generations upon generations.
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:38.400]   And Father God, we know that we have not
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:43.000]   even began to cover just how holy you are.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.160]   We have not began even to exhaustively think about
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:49.080]   the kind of chasm that exists between the holy God
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.960]   and maker of this universe
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.680]   versus creating beings as ourselves.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.120]   But Lord, I pray that we would understand
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.240]   to greater measure that to that measure,
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:01.800]   we would grow in our appreciation for Christ.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.480]   And to that measure, we would grow in our adoration
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.720]   and worship of your name and your work in our lives.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:11.040]   Father God, we pray that as these are foundational truths
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.520]   to the gospel and these are foundational truths
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:17.600]   to the church, would you grant to us a spirit of conviction
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.800]   that these things would dive deep into our hearts
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.800]   and truly cut us so that Lord,
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.000]   there would be no arrogance thinking
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.120]   that we're not so defiled.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.360]   Father God, there would be no arrogance thinking
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.720]   that we could reach you however and any way we want.
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.080]   But rather God, we would be so broken
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:38.400]   and God, that we'd be so appreciative for your great grace.
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.200]   Lord, we thank you, it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
