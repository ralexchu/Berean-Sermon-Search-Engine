[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.140]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 11 verse 35 and we're going to be
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.740]   reading all the way to verse 40.
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:22.340]   Hebrews chapter 11 verse 35 all the way to verse 40.
[00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.500]   Reading out of the NASB it says, "Women received back their dead by resurrection and others
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.620]   were tortured not accepting their release so that they might obtain a better resurrection
[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.780]   and others experienced mockings and scourging, yes also chains and imprisonment.
[00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.500]   They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.700]   the sword.
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.100]   They went about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated, men
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.900]   of whom the world was not worthy, wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.880]   in the ground and all these having gained approval through their faith did not receive
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.700]   what was promised because God had provided something better for us so that apart from
[00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.500]   us they would not be made perfect."
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.500]   Let's pray.
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.060]   Grace Father we pray that your word would speak to us, allow our hearts Lord God to
[00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.020]   be molded according to your purpose and will.
[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.660]   Lord search us and know us and see if there's any hurtful ways in us that all that we have
[00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.460]   we would surrender and that our hearts Lord God in our mind our will will all be molded
[00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.980]   according to your purpose in Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.900]   You know when I first became a Christian I think most people in my generation was trained
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.700]   how to evangelize through the four spiritual laws.
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.220]   Some of you guys may know what they are.
[00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.620]   It was created by a man Bill Bright from CCC and I actually had an opportunity to meet
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.300]   him years ago at a conference and so there was a small number of us maybe about about
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.220]   a 30 of us were able to sit in a room and just pick his brain and a very godly man and
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.380]   I didn't realize that CCC, Campus Crusade for Christ was actually started at UCLA in
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.440]   1951 and so we were able to pick his brain and ask some questions and he was really into
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.220]   praying and fasting at that time so we were very challenged.
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.060]   Some of you guys who you know are maybe a little bit older may have been trained in
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.340]   the same way this four spiritual law basically begins by saying God loves you and has a wonderful
[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.140]   plan for your life and then the second part is but all have sinned and fall short of God's
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.540]   glory and we've been separated from this and third Christ came and died for us to bridge
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.300]   that gap in order that we may have life again and then fourth God requires all men and women
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.700]   to repent and receive this forgiveness and so those are the four spiritual laws and again
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.300]   you know paraphrased but in a nutshell those are the those are the meaning.
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.300]   Again for many years I would say for seven eight years of early life in as a Christian
[00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.420]   I would go through the four spiritual laws because that's how I was trained and and I
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.260]   realized after time passing that the first part of that can easily be misunderstood and
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.700]   I don't think that was the intention of Bill Bright and that that that his intention was
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.420]   to present the full gospel but that first part where it says God loves you and has a
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.140]   wonderful plan for your life I started to see how some people were twisting that to
[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.280]   think that God's ultimate plan for us is for us to prosper.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.180]   He wants us to be healthy.
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.620]   He wants us to be wealthy and so again I met the man and I know that that was not his intention
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.500]   but I started to see how some people can easily twist how the gospel is presented and said
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.260]   well God wants me to be happy right God wants it there's nothing I can do and God God wants
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.820]   me to be happy and so the gospel is a way for me to achieve happiness and I can't do
[00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.560]   that unless I repent and I receive Christ.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.420]   Now the problem with that type of thinking one is completely unbiblical because the Bible
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.660]   does not teach that in fact the Bible completely contradicts that the text that we're looking
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.820]   at up to verse 35 he's been given examples of men and women of faith how sometimes even
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.340]   in their great suffering and sacrifice how God used that to lift them up and to glorify
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.060]   and to save Israel and to do many great things for God but then we get to the second part
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.220]   of chapter 30 verse 35 and he just simply says you know all women receive back their
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.540]   dead by the resurrection and others you know no big hoopla he doesn't even say but he just
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.620]   says and others were tortured not accepting their release so that they might obtain a
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.100]   better resurrection and then he goes down a list of all these things that these people
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:51.140]   experience and they never experienced this abundant life they were tortured they lived
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:59.620]   homeless they were mocked they starved and some of them just died that way so it doesn't
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.820]   fit this narrative that God's ultimate purpose is so that we can have a wonderful life not
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.380]   in the way that many people experience or think that they are you've probably heard
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.180]   of the health and wealth gospel preachers Joel Osteen probably in our generation is
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:21.140]   top in the top of that list and no like you know I don't know for whatever the reason
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:28.020]   that some churches are afraid to call false teachers out because that's part of our job
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:34.000]   right it's part of our job to recognize that when false teaching and false teachers begin
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.180]   to propagate things that are unbiblical it's not just difference of opinion they are actually
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.540]   going against what the Bible teaches and it prevents certain people from coming to Christ
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.820]   Joel Osteen on the top of that list wrote a book called Best Life Now and this is what
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:56.820]   he says God didn't make you to be average God created you to excel therefore if you
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.580]   will start acting like it talking like it seeing yourself as more than a conqueror you
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.100]   will live a prosperous and victorious life obviously what he means by prosperous is being
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:14.180]   very wealthy Benny Hinn is another man who is very well known and had decades of ministry
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.580]   teaching the same false gospel and this is what he is quoting saying God will begin to
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:28.380]   prosper you for money always follows righteousness clearly he never read the Bible clearly never
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.740]   read the Bible Jesus says when people were coming to me I want to follow you said birds
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.140]   of the you know fox have holes birds of the airs have nests but the Son of Man has nowhere
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:42.460]   to rest his head in other words I'm homeless if you follow me you're also going to be homeless
[00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.860]   so he warned them to make sure that you know what you're getting into all the disciples
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.580]   they didn't live a better life they didn't get a better job most of them with the exception
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:58.540]   of one were martyred because they believed in Jesus Christ we have countless number of
[00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:04.940]   people because of their faith have ruined their lives Apostle Paul a perfect example
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:11.900]   of one who was on the you know like he's pretty much achieved what every Jew would have wanted
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.060]   in education and in wealth and position and even religiously and yet he ruined all of
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:23.340]   that because he met Christ I remember years ago there was a man named Fred Price so you
[00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.820]   guys most of you guys who are younger will probably not remember him but he was a famous
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:33.420]   preacher in LA and his church bought the Coliseum some of you guys who remember the Coliseum
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.820]   and it could fit probably about 50 to 60,000 people so it was one of the largest churches
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:43.580]   in this area probably in the United States excellent preacher and so not knowing who
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.100]   he was early Sunday morning before I went to church I wanted to hear a sermon and I
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:52.860]   had him on and one of the sermons he had people stand up and said anybody who's on welfare
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:57.700]   stand up so he had a bunch of people not knowing what he was doing just starting to stand up
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.660]   anybody who's who's not you know getting minimum wage stand up anybody who doesn't get paid
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:08.660]   this much stand up then after they stood up he began to rebuke them and this is on national
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:14.940]   television he said the reason why you're on welfare is because you don't have enough faith
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:19.960]   the reason why you don't have a house is because you don't have enough faith the reason why
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.660]   you don't drive a certain type of car is because you lack faith and then he began to expound
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:30.780]   upon his wealth how he has so many Rolls Royces and how he has so many house what kind of
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:36.380]   clothes he wears and how much his shoes cost and all of that on national television and
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:41.300]   you can see just the demeanor of these people who stood up just kind of you know shriveling
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:48.420]   in shame and I remember watching that being so disgusted that this man was publicly shaming
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:55.140]   these people simply because they weren't making money sad to say even though we may be disgusted
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:01.260]   by what he says this health and wealth gospel has so deeply in have been embedded into our
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:08.860]   psyche we practice it without even recognizing that that's what we're doing even in biblical
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:14.920]   even in biblical Bible teaching churches even like ours I remember years ago at a conference
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:20.460]   John Piper came to speak and he was the keynote speaker and he got up on the pulpit and he
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:25.860]   said you know I had this message prepared but I really felt convicted to preach a completely
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:31.900]   different sermon and then he began to preach about suffering as a Christian and that's
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:39.260]   a whole sermon was based upon how God ordained suffering for the sake of his glory it was
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.420]   a great message I always wondered why he decided to change the message I found out later on
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:48.500]   what the reason was which I'm not going to get into this morning but I remember at that
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:55.180]   conference there were about 27 Russian pastors who used to pastor in the old communist regime
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:59.480]   and they were coming in and out of prison and so they invited that to come pay for their
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.860]   airfare got them to stay and they were they happened to be in the room when he was preaching
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:09.100]   the preaching that then after John Piper finished they asked the leader of that group to come
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.980]   up and give his testimony and I remember that Russian pastor sit up and the first thing
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.940]   that he said was I want to thank John Piper for preaching that sermon because I never
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:25.020]   thought that I would hear a sermon in America to American pastors about suffering so it
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.540]   was in one sense thanking him for the sermon but at the same sense backslapping everybody
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:37.300]   else right because they said we never thought that this would ever be taught in an American
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:47.020]   church the author of the that's writing this letter remember why he's writing this letter
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:53.900]   he's writing this letter because the persecution in the church wouldn't let up remember in
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.940]   the beginning they were rejoicing in their property being confiscated when their friends
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.540]   were being arrested they went them visited them and and they were rejoicing we're suffering
[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:07.100]   for Christ and they were willing to put up with that for a short period but it wouldn't
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:12.820]   let up 10 years passed 20 years passed 30 years passed so by the time this letter is
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.660]   written they're in their second possibly even third generation Christians and they're beginning
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:24.700]   to drift back into their old line now backsliding usually doesn't happen overnight you don't
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.220]   wake up one morning and say you know what it's too hard following Christ so I'm just
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:35.180]   gonna go and make money you don't do that usually backsliding happens because you compromise
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.980]   but God calls you to do something say oh what if I do this God didn't call everybody or
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:44.300]   what if this and you start to make small compromises and you begin to see your heart starting to
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:50.340]   harden up you've never in your mind you've never abandoned your faith you've just made
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:55.460]   series of compromises that cause you to drift further and further away from God physically
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:00.780]   you're still at church you're still at Bible study but you know deep in your heart you
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:07.500]   have a limit to how far you will go in following Christ so the Christianity that we've created
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.580]   is a Christianity that's that doesn't look like the scripture the Christianity that we've
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:17.460]   created is the breaking of the second commandment of the 10th commandment where he says thou
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.700]   shall not worship any other God and the second commandment is thou shall not make any brave
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:27.500]   images of me and worship me in other words don't make up a God that is more palatable
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:34.180]   to you and worship that and say you're worshiping me backsliding typically happens gradually
[00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:40.740]   because we avoid suffering at every end if I do this I might lose my job if I do this
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.220]   my friends are gonna be happy if I do this I'm not gonna not be able to get this if I
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:50.020]   do this I might be not be able to get that house and so after a series of compromises
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:56.620]   we have created a Jesus that doesn't look anything like the scripture so he's writing
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:02.180]   this letter to challenge them that Christ is better than anything that you are you are
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:07.380]   backsliding into that Christ is better than that do you recognize who Jesus is he's better
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.620]   than the angel he's better than Moses he's better than the sacrifices he's better than
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:16.700]   the priests he's better than the temple he's a he has a better covenant so the whole thing
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.940]   that we've been talking about in the whole book of Hebrews is he is better do you believe
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:28.780]   that so if that is the priest if he's writing a this letter to a group of people who are
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:35.420]   having a hard time with suffering you would think that he would leave this out because
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:41.460]   this would be completely discouraging right leave it at the first 35 women receive back
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:46.100]   their dead by resurrection all these great things happen because they believe God but
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:53.200]   then he said but others they're tortured some of them died experienced mocking scourging
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:59.900]   chains imprisonment sawn in two tempted experienced death sheepskins goatskin destitute afflicted
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:04.740]   ill-treated wandering deserts mountains and caves and holes in the ground and it doesn't
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:10.400]   end with they did all of that but God lifted it up them up and so therefore they experience
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:19.380]   greatness and then they die no they just died I mean if your goal is to write this letter
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:25.340]   to encourage people who are suffering to continue and persevere you would think that he would
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:31.660]   say relief is coming for a short time you're experiencing this but after that you're going
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:36.400]   to experience glory just just put in a year put in a two years and if you continue good
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:45.240]   things are coming he doesn't say that some experience this some experience this the heroes
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:50.960]   of the faith that he talks about some experience their children being resurrected and some
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:56.520]   voluntarily give their life and he says the reason why is because they wanted a better
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:04.040]   resurrection because they believed that the payoff wasn't here they were willing to even
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:12.040]   give their life because they knew that the hope that they had wasn't here it was after
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:20.520]   and that's why they were able to persevere you know I was at a conference not that long
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:26.700]   ago and you know when I was when our church was struggling and we were small we had like
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:32.640]   30 35 people for many years you know we did a podcast you know describing our our church
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.040]   in the beginning because it wasn't a normal church plan we just got thrown out we just
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.240]   try to survive right and I just had a kid another kid and then another kid eventually
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:48.320]   another kid right we had many kids and in the midst of what we were doing in ministry
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:53.720]   you know we were just trying to survive and no one asked me about ministry advice back
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:59.320]   then right in fact everybody was giving me ministry advice right you say oh you should
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.320]   go to that church you should go to this conference oh if you talk to that pastor oh if you were
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:07.520]   discipled by this by maybe your church would do better but as soon as our church started
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:12.120]   growing to a certain number you know 300 400 and and then they said what are you doing
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.560]   over there how do you do your bible study what is your teaching like and all of a sudden
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:22.320]   they want to know so I remember I I was at a conference and I was asked that question
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.620]   and you know we had smart men there's like three or four of the churches that are larger
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.360]   in size and so they asked us to give a presentation about our church and ministry philosophy what
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:36.360]   we're doing and each one of them were going around and smart guys articulate you know
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:41.120]   talented gifted and and I was blown away you know I felt like I don't belong here I don't
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.800]   even understand some of the words that they're using you know and they came to my turn so
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.600]   Peter what happened at your church and I told him the story that I we told you in the podcast
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:55.080]   like I didn't want to be a pastor I just felt bad for the kids and I just held on for dear
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:04.640]   life right and that's how we got here and I remember it's like huh it was nothing useful
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:12.160]   that I said oh then I just didn't quit right and I remember after I said that the the pastor
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:17.200]   was presiding to kind of wrap things up and he said who knows if you did what Peter did
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:22.680]   maybe your church would be the next Berean and I remember and then I remember I ended
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:30.200]   up by saying or not it was awkward it was very awkward right clear I didn't belong there
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:36.760]   right because the point that I was trying to make was that it wasn't ingenuity it wasn't
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:40.240]   anything because we're not doing anything different that we did the first seven years
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:46.680]   and then next seven years that that caused it to grow but our natural tendency is to
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:54.240]   think that if we do certain things right good things are going to come and good things is
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:01.960]   like bigger church better finances better homes healthier wealthier and long life and
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:08.880]   then when that doesn't happen we deconstruct what did we do wrong what should we do better
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:15.000]   what's our plan and then we're constantly deconstructing and reconstructing because of
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:22.160]   what because we have what we think God wants better life healthier life longer life better
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.080]   bank account right our children are safe better taking care of better education and so we
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.800]   have the same standard that the world has we just brought it into our Christian life
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:37.160]   and we don't we don't normally filter that out we just kind of you know because it has
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:42.160]   that Christian name on it we don't recognize that as the health and well it's so deeply
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:51.160]   embedded in us this passage completely obliterates those thoughts it says that some were sawn
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:57.240]   in two now it doesn't mention any names none of this has any names because prior to that
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:02.880]   it was mentioning Abraham and Moses and Joseph and Jacob and all these great men and women
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:08.080]   who by faith did these great things but then he says but the others who are tortured and
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:14.880]   killed and you know and they were imprisoned and changed wandering in deserts none of their
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.200]   names are mentioned I think the reason why none of the names are mentioned because there's
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:25.840]   too many because we have a tendency like when you read missionary books you usually read
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:32.440]   a book about an individual who went and bore ridiculous fruit whether it's in China or
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.720]   India wherever it is and then we put them on a pedestal we read about them I want to
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:42.720]   be like Hudson Taylor I want to be like William Carey I'm gonna be the next Billy Graham I'm
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:50.880]   gonna be the next John something and so we put them on pedestal so we know a lot about
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:59.960]   very few people majority of the people that have gone before us for every one person that's
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:06.000]   been highlighted there's probably hundreds of thousands of people who just labored couldn't
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:15.400]   pay their bills just barely surviving constantly tempted to quit and just making it and it
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:21.400]   is God using those people to continue to establish his kingdom we didn't get here by the Billy
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:28.240]   Graham's of the world we got here by the grace of God there were some Billy Graham's there
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:34.760]   were some William Carey's there were some Hudson Taylor's but majority of the people
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:41.880]   that is described in verse 35 to 38 are never mentioned in fact for every one Moses you're
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:47.880]   gonna see hundreds of other people that God used that you never heard of but they're in
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.640]   scripture hundreds of thousands maybe millions of people that have walked out into desert
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:21:00.840]   and never bore fruit church planters who suffered for years and just closed up missionaries
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:06.400]   who've gone to places and never saw a single convert I don't know how many pastors that
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:12.440]   I know dedicated their lives and in retirement didn't have a single penny in their name no
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:17.920]   house no retirement no car nothing and they were dependent on other people just just to
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:24.400]   make the end part I have missionary friends who've been out in the field for 20-25 years
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:31.200]   come back and they said they feel like beggars because they have nothing in their name I
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:37.520]   know countless number of missionaries who've lost their children in their faith they dedicated
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:42.520]   everything to follow Christ and went out to foreign land and their children got caught
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:50.880]   up in in something and they walked away from their faith for every one Moses's and William
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:57.320]   Carey's and Amy Carmichael's these people that we write about and put on pedestals many
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:05.280]   of them experienced verse 35 to 38 he says some were sawn in two we don't know when you
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.960]   think of Isaiah Isaiah is probably the most quoted Old Testament prophet in the New Testament
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:17.720]   Isaiah according to Jewish tradition was martyred for his faith Manasseh King Manasseh was one
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:23.320]   of the worst kings that Israel had and just got sick and tired of Israel of Isaiah constantly
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:28.960]   telling them you need to turn from your sins or judgment is coming and they got sick he
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:35.680]   got so sick and tired of him according to Jewish tradition he was sawn in two the true
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.400]   prophets who were speaking and trying to turn Israel from their sins they were the ones
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:45.320]   who were stoned the false prophets kept on coming and saying peace peace when there is
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:50.640]   no peace the reason why the false prophets were popular is because that's what everybody
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:58.780]   was looking for peace you know what peace the modern-day translation for pieces health
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:05.920]   wealth and safety and that's what the false teachers were propagating peace peace when
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:14.940]   there is no peace Jeremiah here's a man who lived a miserable life he's known as the weeping
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:23.040]   prophet he wrote a book called Lamentations because the whole book is about lamenting
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:29.580]   in verse 37b it says they went about in sheepskins goatskins destitute afflicted ill-treated
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:34.440]   men whom the world was not worthy wandering in deserts mountains and caves holes in the
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:40.840]   ground now any prophet probably can recognize that maybe this is their life as well but
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:48.400]   Jeremiah exemplifies this I mean he lived such a miserable life because God was using
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:55.000]   him to warn the nation of Israel and everywhere he went to speak they hated his guts God had
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.280]   him do such weird things just wandering in the desert and and doing walking around you
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:07.160]   know in places where he's gonna be harmed all his life just weeping not simply because
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:13.400]   of what was happening to him externally but internally he was saddened by what was coming
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:22.120]   pleading with Israel to turn and they would not turn you know when I think about my life
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:27.360]   there are four periods that you know like watershed moments that I can pinpoint and
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:34.280]   say that that completely changed my life first is coming to America obviously and I didn't
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:38.160]   choose that right that happened to me because my parents chose to come to United States
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:43.560]   and that's the reason why I don't speak Korean here I'm speaking English right the culture
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.840]   where we grew up all that changed because my parents decided come to United States so
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.640]   that was a a watershed moment for me at that time secondly which is probably the most important
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:58.600]   out of all of them was when I became a Christian 1983 December 26 1130 p.m. I remember very
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:04.440]   distinctly when it happened and it was almost like being there for your birth right physical
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.880]   birth that would be gross but that's what it felt like spiritually I knew when it happened
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:13.040]   like my life would never be the same so that that happened so that was the second and that
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.360]   changed everything for me for me the third thing that happened was when I decided to
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.440]   go into ministry full-time ministry the reason why that was a watershed moment it wasn't
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:26.640]   because I was choosing between am I gonna serve God or not serve God I don't know how
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:31.360]   any Christian chooses I'm not gonna serve God right I'm a Christian but I'm just gonna
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:38.400]   do whatever I want right you're not a Christian how can somebody who who believes what we
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.640]   confessed with whether you are an attorney or business or whatever it is that you're
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.000]   doing live your life saying you know what I'm just gonna live my life and some people
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.480]   are gonna go to hell some people are gonna go to heaven I'm just gonna live my life that
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:53.440]   makes no sense to me so it wasn't a decision between my gonna serve God and not serve God
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.760]   but specifically I'm going to full-time ministry and the reason why that was a difficult decision
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:04.560]   is because I'm a third generation pastor I saw the misery that my parents went through
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:11.280]   and children who are in that family and then my dad came from a pastor's family and the
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:15.560]   misery that he experienced as a result of that I remember during the war the Korean
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:20.280]   War because my grandfather was a pastor he had to hide because the communists were coming
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:25.520]   so he was basically gone and my dad had to take care of his family when he was 16 years
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:31.480]   old selling medicine because his dad was a pastor and so when I was wrestling with this
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:36.520]   idea I don't want to like I'll do anything I'll be a businessman I'll go to missions
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:41.280]   I'll do anything but anything but a pastor I don't want to do what my dad did and then
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:48.000]   I had to surrender okay what else am I gonna if this is I want to preach the gospel but
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.160]   if I make a lot of money I'm concerned that I'm gonna be tempted so I'm gonna go down
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:57.440]   this path but then fourth and final thing and I don't know what else is coming ahead
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:05.440]   but the fourth and final thing was in the context of this church after five six seven
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:10.600]   years of struggling in the church and not wanting to just I was literally just dragging
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:15.040]   my feet and only reason why I did what I did is because I felt like the kids that were
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:20.680]   there they're not kids anymore obviously but kids weren't gonna make it so out of guilt
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:25.720]   it wasn't out of great faith or or you know I this vision like what was your vision I
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:31.000]   had no vision like seriously I mean I'm just being honest I had no vision for this church
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.480]   it was out of guilt I can't leave them because if I leave them I'm gonna abandon my kids
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:46.440]   they were like kids to me right my own kids but I remember wrestling with this idea if
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:50.000]   I'm gonna I came into ministry thinking like okay I'm gonna do great things for God I'm
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   gonna preach the gospel I'm gonna plant churches I'm gonna go out to missions and even if I
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.880]   die early that's a good way to live and die and I remember thinking reading about Jim
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:03.400]   Elliott how he prayed that he doesn't have a long life but a meaningful life even if
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.520]   it's short and that's exactly how he went out and I was I remember thinking that's like
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:12.440]   yeah that's what I want to do I want to do hard things for God and if I die early that's
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:19.240]   that's a good way to live your life but then the last part of it I had to wrestle with
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:29.800]   what if God called you to be Jeremiah because Jeremiah just lived a long life just miserable
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:36.000]   preaching to people who didn't want to hear never saw never saw revival never really saw
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.880]   fruit everybody that he cared about that he was preaching to hated him I mean he's the
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:48.720]   weeping prophet and I remember really wrestling with that and as I was digging through scripture
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:54.920]   and I was like wow there's more Jeremias in the Bible than there are Paul's who am I to
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.920]   come before God and say I'm gonna hear my Lord send me there and then God said well
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:03.800]   guess go to the Israelites who stiff neck and they're not gonna listen to how long until
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:13.120]   you die because they're not gonna turn will you still go and I couldn't answer that question
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:19.560]   I'll go to China North Korea you know and I remember during that period like I wanted
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:24.640]   to do the craziest things because there was some sense of glory in that so I used to do
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:28.600]   a lot of public preaching you know go out in the streets and I would see the end of
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.400]   the parade and I would be the last person at the parade and I would preach the gospel
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:38.480]   right and I remember this one thing in Cal State LA they were having the anti-war rally
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:44.120]   because of the first first war in the Gulf and there were hundreds of people over there
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:48.360]   who probably didn't want to go to class and they were out there as an anti-war chants
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:52.760]   and they had a mic set up and and we just happened to be witnessing there in LA and
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.640]   I thought maybe this is a good place so I just kind of you know took about 40 minutes
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:02.280]   to gear up you know courage and at the end when we were about to leave I said give me
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:10.320]   a minute I said oh shoot what's he gonna do so I stood up and I got the mic and I started
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:14.720]   I started preaching and they they didn't know what I was preaching obviously until I said
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:22.920]   name Jesus and if you ever want to know what it feels like to have 300 people flip them
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:30.600]   off all at once I'll explain it to you what that felt like right and it was not fun but
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:35.360]   afterwards there was a sense of glory in that like I did something hard for Jesus right
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:41.840]   I did something hard for Jesus I was willing to do all of that even if it meant being living
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:45.840]   in poverty even if it meant having homeless people in my house I was willing to do all
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:53.480]   of that but I did not want to live the life that my dad lived struggling in the small
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:57.680]   church taking care having a hard time paying his bills always worried about what the church
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.600]   people are gonna think if he did this and if we bought this car what are they gonna
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.560]   think that we spent too much money on this we can't buy this house we can't take a vacation
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:16.800]   because we can't do this I don't want to do that but what if God called you to do that
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:26.080]   and I couldn't say yes I said yes to everything else even homeless ministry my wife experienced
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:35.080]   having homeless people in my house I said yes to that but I couldn't say yes to pastoring
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:42.600]   a church because I didn't want to repeat what I saw but the question that was brought to
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:50.200]   me was clear are you gonna come before God and say here my Lord send me over here to
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:55.560]   these people at this time so I can do this or are you just gonna say here my Lord send
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:32:05.680]   me even if it's to this man that broke me more than the initial time when I decided
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:10.920]   to go into ministry more than when I became a Christian because when I became a Christian
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:21.080]   it was just good God loves me God created the universe loves me and he died for me like
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:27.320]   it was all good nothing that I had nothing that I sacrificed at that time seemed worth
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:36.400]   holding on to but the fourth watershed in my life was what really broke me and I realized
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:45.760]   that even in the way that I wanted to do ministry I had my own plans I had my own desires I
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:52.320]   had my own glory in mind what if God calls you to serve people who don't want to be served
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:33:02.040]   all your life will you still say yes Apostle Paul when he was called here's a guy who had
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:09.680]   everything money already famed religiously on the top of the ladder meets Christ and
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:19.520]   his life is ruined literally his life is ruined when he meets Christ Jesus says from the get-go
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:25.400]   I will show him how much he must suffer for my name he didn't say he's gonna glorify me
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.800]   it's all like all that stuff you know he said no I'm gonna show him how much he must suffer
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:35.160]   for my name when he's writing 2nd Corinthians he's writing to a group of people who are
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:40.960]   questioning his apostleship because he was not the greatest speaker you know Apollos
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:47.240]   was the great speaker Peter was a great leader you know Paul was the latecomer and they were
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:50.760]   questioning his because they didn't like what he was saying so they were kind of disqualifying
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:59.560]   him saying he's not a true apostle but Apostle Paul in defense and he is defending himself
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:04.440]   because people were questioning I mean I think naturally he just was not the best speaker
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.920]   in fact the book of Acts says that he was a habit of preaching so long people actually
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:13.840]   died that's what it said he was in the habit of preaching on and on and somebody fell up
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:17.680]   and died and so you have to resurrect that guy right that's how bad of a preacher he
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:24.360]   was right he didn't know when to stop but he in defense this is what he says in 2nd
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:29.120]   Corinthians 11 24 five times I received from the Jews 39 lashes three times I was beaten
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:33.920]   with rods once I was stoned three times I was shipwrecked a night and a day I spent
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:38.680]   in the deep I've been on frequent journeys and dangers from river dangers from robbers
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:42.560]   dangers from countrymen dangers from Gentiles dangers in the city dangers in the wilderness
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:47.160]   dangers in the sea dangers among the false brethren I have been in labor and hardship
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:51.760]   through many sleepless nights in hunger and thirst often without food in cold and exposure
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:57.640]   and so his credential is not his upbringing his credential is not the many churches that
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:07.520]   he planted his credential wasn't his knowledge his credential was his suffering he said you
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:12.840]   question my apostasy look at my suffering but along with that verse 28 apart from such
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:19.880]   external things there's a daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches I mean
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:26.280]   it's hard enough the external things the stoning and the hardship and persecution and the whipping
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:31.800]   that he got but he says on top of that there's this internal pressure because he's concerned
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:39.760]   for the churches for the people as he's sitting in prison he's concerned for the Philippians
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:48.000]   as he's waiting to die in 2nd Timothy he's writing to his protege because he's concerned
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.640]   that even as he is facing death he sees his internal pressure who is weak without my being
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:36:04.520]   weak who is led into sin without my intense concern this is a man who understood that
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:11.040]   he was called to supper just like Jesus said he wasn't just called so that he can stand
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:16.640]   on a pulpit and hear the say it the Lord and there's where Jesus is it's like no he did
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:22.120]   that in the midst of much suffering this flies in the face of all the people that I quoted
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:28.440]   in the beginning of the sermon we hear so many times about how Christianity is flourishing
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.800]   all over the world and I've traveled enough and talked to enough people out in the field
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:39.940]   to know that the number of Christians have been so bloated I remember talking to a pastor
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:46.780]   in an underground church in China and I've heard numbers as as big as 350 million Christians
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:52.380]   and I asked him is that true and he said not even close he said most of the numbers that
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.220]   you're hearing about are people who are coming to faith because of the health and wealth
[00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:02.700]   gospel Kenneth Hagin Kenneth Copeland all false teachers because they promise that if
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:08.660]   you believe in Jesus that you can have the wealth that these missionaries have so they
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:15.200]   want to be like Americans that if you believe Jesus and Jesus is is their ticket to get
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:21.820]   wealth and a lot of the people who are coming to faith are coming for that reason it's not
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:26.260]   the true gospel it's the health and wealth gospel that's spreading all over the world
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:33.820]   Jesus clearly said that the path to life is narrow and it is difficult and few would be
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:42.220]   found in it he says all of this and reminds us again in first Peter 4 12 beloved do not
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:47.220]   be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you you shouldn't be surprised because Jesus told
[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:51.700]   us the Bible made it very plain to us there is examples after examples that are given
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:56.380]   to us in the scripture which comes upon you for your testing as though some strange things
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:04.260]   were happening to you you notice how whenever hardship comes we think what did we do wrong
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:12.160]   if a church is planted and it doesn't bear fruit it doesn't grow what did we do wrong
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:17.640]   people begin to leave because you're preaching the gospel what did we do wrong if we started
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:21.700]   having relational issues and and sinners don't appreciate what you're doing what did we do
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:27.280]   wrong we planted a church and we're trying to share the gospel and nobody's interested
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:32.580]   and what did we do wrong we have a tendency to kind of deconstruct everything that we
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:36.780]   think isn't meeting our standard and so we need to reconstruct constantly deconstructing
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:41.740]   reconstructing deconstructing reconstructing in order to get what what the world has taught
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:49.500]   us what success is when all he told us to do is to be faithful do not turn from your
[00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:56.860]   the word to the left or to the right in season and out of season whether they listen or don't
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:00.580]   listen whether you bear fruit or don't bear fruit whether you the church grows or doesn't
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:06.940]   grow in season and out of season I only gave you one thing preach the word in season and
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:16.140]   out of season sometimes the children are resurrected sometimes they are not sometimes you will
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:20.140]   experience well sometimes you will not sometimes people will thank you and praise you and sometimes
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:30.180]   you will not God uses that all for his glory would you still follow Christ if following
[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:35.860]   Christ meant you can't get into the school that you want if you have to forfeit your
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:41.820]   career would you still follow Christ if you can't get the house that you want would you
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:46.940]   still follow Christ if your children are not safe and given the best that you want to give
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:54.540]   them would you still follow Christ are there conditions upon following Christ you see the
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:59.540]   problem with the health and wealth gospel is we don't break the first commandment the
[00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:03.220]   first commandment thou shalt not worship any other God but the second commandment is thou
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:09.620]   shalt not make grave an image of me and worship it in other words don't create an idol and
[00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:15.380]   then attach my name on it and then worship it thinking that you're worshiping me when
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:22.180]   we deconstruct everything that doesn't get us to a better life we've created a Jesus
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:31.460]   that's not in the scripture if the only Christian faith that that we have embraced always leads
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:42.020]   to a better comfortable life then that Jesus is not the Jesus of the Bible see verses 35
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:45.980]   through 38 completely blows that out of the water you know the health and wealth gospel
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:51.980]   people verse Jeremiah 29 11 is a verse that they love it says for I know the plans that
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:56.940]   I have for you declares or plans for welfare not for calamity to give you a future and
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:02.180]   a hope the way that the health and wealth gospel people see this is and sometimes we
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:06.900]   even use it to encourage other people that though it's hard now if you if you endure
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:14.660]   a little bit better things are coming tomorrow like tomorrow put put in your time and and
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:20.540]   discipline and sacrifice now then better things will come tomorrow now is that anything different
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:25.900]   than the world I go to the gym I wake up 5 in the morning and I you know outwork everybody
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:30.460]   else like this is why I got a million dollars because I put in the hard work early and I
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:34.740]   suffered you know and I did what the other people are not willing to do and that's why
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:39.980]   I was successful and the health and wealth gospel people use this verse to basically
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:45.260]   perpetuate the same thing same wisdom that the world is giving put in your time now sacrifice
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:53.340]   now discipline now then when you're 30 when you're 40 you're going to be wealthy healthy
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:42:00.900]   when he says God has a wonderful plan for your life clearly the wonderful plan is in
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:07.980]   health and wealth the wonderful plan he's talking about with that though some died and
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:12.060]   experienced resurrection the others voluntarily gave their life and were tortured for what
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:21.020]   purpose for a better resurrection the wonderful plan that the Bible talks about is an eternity
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:32.260]   when Christ comes when Christ comes and if we miss that you didn't just miss a part of
[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:38.420]   Christianity if you miss that you didn't miss you know you weren't a B+ student as a Christian
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:46.820]   but you weren't a if you miss that you missed Christianity period the Christianity that
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:51.060]   we practice is a health and wealth gospel mentality is no different than the Buddhist
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:58.180]   going to the temple you ever go to you know the Asian countries and the ancient ruins
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:04.300]   are all Buddhist temple you wonder why they went through so much trouble to build statues
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:09.260]   of Buddha and temples and just weird places up in mountains and you know like this is
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:15.300]   this is a thousand Buddha mountain right this is a hundred feet Buddha mountain this is
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:22.020]   mountain Buddha this is river Buddha I mean I remember the first time visiting China and
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:29.420]   we must have gone to about a hundred Buddha something so why why was this so important
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:36.620]   because that was their avenue to get health and well that was their way of getting a better
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:45.300]   life if we're not careful Christians could do the same thing by becoming a member in
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:51.620]   the church by being faithful and serving and giving that I'm going to trade in something
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:44:01.740]   because I'm expecting something bigger and then when that doesn't happen God's not real
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:09.220]   you're right that God is not real the God that many of those people turn away from was
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:16.900]   never real because he never promised that that is not the God of the Bible the God of
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:24.140]   the Bible tells us in Hebrews 11 39 to 40 and all these having gained approval through
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:28.940]   their faith not through their hard work not through their sacrifice but sacrifices came
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:33.980]   because of their faith did not receive what was promised because God had provided something
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:40.740]   better for us so that apart from us they would not be made perfect 2nd Corinthians 4 17 for
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:47.140]   momentary light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:57.740]   comparison do you believe that even in our suffering it is producing in us a glory that
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:04.740]   you cannot possibly imagine that can be fulfilled here it's far beyond that when his glory comes
[00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:10.580]   why did some people experience this great deliverance and why did some people just die
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:16.100]   in their difficult state the answer is simple it may be difficult to understand but the
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:21.060]   answer is simple because in Isaiah 42 verse 8 it says I am the Lord that is my name I
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:26.180]   would not give my glory to another nor my praise to given images God says over and over
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:33.420]   again he says for my name's sake for my glory over and over again for my glory so the answer
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:40.780]   is simple why was why did Joseph go through that and then experience why did he experience
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:45.900]   what he experienced he said for my glory why did Isaiah live his life and then was sawn
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:55.900]   in two for my glory why was Moses lifted up and experienced all of that for his glory
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:46:04.580]   why did Jeremiah live in misery for his glory his glory in our comfort his glory in our
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:10.140]   suffering his glory in long life his glory in life cut short his glory in living in peace
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:15.060]   and it is for his glory that we live a life of turmoil it is his glory when we are financially
[00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:21.660]   wealthy and it is his glory when we are struggling financially all things good and bad says ultimately
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:34.540]   for his glory I know what a non-believer will say when I say this that's checked up he's
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:41.540]   playing with us so he's he's toying with us and letting some people suffer and some people
[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:50.300]   do this and that and he's a jerk some people will say that because they don't believe because
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:58.980]   they do not see because they only see this life and if this life is all that matters
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:06.220]   they're absolutely right because it didn't pay off some people are suffering and some
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:14.300]   people are doing fine he's unfair the end but you have to understand the Bible says
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:18.180]   that you and I have been created to be his image bearers that's our whole purpose why
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:24.220]   we exist is so that we may reflect his glory so salvation is for the purpose of restoring
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:33.660]   us so that we may live according to how he created us now keep that in mind now why is
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:44.140]   that beneficial to us because we live when he is glorified let me say that again we live
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:52.380]   we experience the greatest life when he is magnified the most imagine if LeBron James
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:56.020]   okay I know some of you guys are not fan of LeBron James Steph Curry whoever you want
[00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:03.380]   to say right if LeBron James came into came in on the court and he started to interview
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:08.340]   everybody how can I make all of you happy right just make a list and then he started
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:12.940]   reading all that okay so I'm gonna design my game to make everybody happy first of all
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:18.140]   that's impossible because 30,000 people are gonna have different ideas right pass more
[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:25.820]   shoot more sit down sit up right and I'm like the criticism of LeBron James like man that
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:33.300]   guy he doesn't you know he passes too much he's not clutch you know he should he should
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:38.980]   take the shot then when he takes the shot he's like dude he doesn't pass all he wants
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:46.620]   his own glory there's nothing he can do to satisfy anybody everybody to begin with but
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:52.060]   the best way to make the most number of people happy is to play the best game that he's able
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:49:04.380]   to play when he is glorified on the court everybody everybody experiences euphoria it
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:14.100]   brings people together we experience koinonia high-fiving and you talk about that for years
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:21.940]   remember remember when you were there when he did this remember when Kobe shot 81 points
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:33.100]   remember when he did that what did he do other than glorify himself so selfish so egocentric
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:40.780]   why did we experience this life because Kobe glorified himself because you and I were created
[00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:51.300]   for worship so when God is glorified we experience the best life so salvation is to restore us
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:57.700]   so that our eyes may be open to see this glory and for eternity we're going to be seeing
[00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:03.420]   his glory in a in a greater and more magnificent way so we're going to be experiencing this
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:11.460]   life so this momentary suffering this momentary this blip of a life this mist of a life that
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:15.340]   whether you live comfortably whether you live uncomfortably whether you are rich or whether
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:25.260]   you are poor all this is producing in us eternal glory that we may have in his presence that's
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:32.660]   why sometimes some people are called and they live in North Korea and some of us live in
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:42.500]   America there's a kind of glory that God can receive only when rich people are giving there's
[00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:47.860]   a kind of glory that God gets when we are suffering there's a kind of glory that God
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:53.900]   gets when we live a long life living for Christ and there's a type of glory that God gets
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:51:03.460]   when our life is cut short because when he is glorified what happens the world sees the
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:10.220]   world sees because what God is interested in is an eternity that more and more people
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:19.500]   may see his glory and come to him so sometimes God will use our suffering for that purpose
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:24.940]   let me read the final passage and I know it's a little bit long this is a the verse that
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:29.660]   I know elder James used to quote when he was younger all the time right and I don't know
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:36.020]   his suffering in inside but this was one of his favorite verses and Habakkuk is written
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:40.100]   during a period when Israel it's kind of like like Isaiah he's preaching to people don't
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:45.460]   want to hear it he's wondering God why are you allowing the unjust to to punish the just
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:51.300]   and and at the end conclusion of his grumbling before God he says this though the fig tree
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:57.260]   should not blossom and there be no fruit on the vines though the yield of the olive should
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:02.540]   fail and the fields produce no fruit no food though the flock should be cut off from the
[00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:09.120]   fold and there be no cattle in the stalls yet I will exalt in the Lord I will rejoice
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:18.380]   in the God of my salvation it doesn't in the end it's not about the vines being plenty
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:24.700]   and revival and all that in the end is do you believe this God do you believe this God
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:34.600]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
