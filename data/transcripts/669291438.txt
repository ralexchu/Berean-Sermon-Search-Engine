[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   All right, mic check.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Okay, perfect.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   All right.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   My name is David Kim, and I'm a girl dad, a husband/servant, photographer, cheerleader,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.520]   social media manager, and whatever my wife says I am, to my wife, Tessia.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.760]   But most importantly, I'm a sinner saved by grace and adopted into the family of God.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.160]   Before I continue with the rest of this testimony, I just want to put a disclaimer out there.
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.280]   If any part of this testimony speaks to you, and if it convicts anybody, that's from God.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.600]   If I totally botch it, and it just goes all kinds of haywire, and nobody knows what I
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.240]   said, that was all me.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.240]   So all glory to God, all the mistakes come down to me.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.000]   So I just want to put that out there first.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.080]   But anyways, thank you for taking the time to hear my testimony and witnessing my baptism.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.720]   I know most of you didn't really have a choice and didn't know this was even happening, but
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.920]   I appreciate you guys patiently suffering with me in the next few minutes all the same.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.040]   I became a follower of Jesus Christ in 2001, after I watched the Billy Graham crusade on
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.040]   TV with my father.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.360]   I prayed with my father, who was a missionary and still is, and accepted Christ that day.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.000]   And yes, I'm an MK, and that also means I have all sorts of underlying issues, and that's
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.480]   just the nature of the beast.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.960]   But I should also get out of the way that I also received a sprinkle baptism and was
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.880]   never fully baptized through full immersion.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.680]   So although I did accept Christ, I never, just purely out of ignorance, never received
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.160]   a full immersion.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.400]   To continue, after that day, I pursued God, or more accurately, God pursued me.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.520]   I found a strong community within my church and experienced God's love through my friends
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.400]   and the pastors that God placed in my life.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.560]   In my third year at school, however, I grew lazy and began hardening my heart towards
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.720]   God's voice.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.520]   I don't have an epic, traumatic story here.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.480]   Instead, I simply stopped praying and reading the word as often as I used to.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.400]   And the change was so subtle, but dangerous.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.680]   And over time, I simply forgot how good God is, just like the Israelites repeatedly did
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.000]   after their exodus from Egypt.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.280]   And I began to ask, "Is Jesus really all I need in life?"
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.800]   I'll save you the time and the pain of discovering the answer to that question for yourself,
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.000]   and I'll tell you, the answer is absolutely yes.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.920]   I can confidently say, as someone who got to travel all over the world through the military
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.840]   and just through some interesting experiences, met all kinds of people, nothing, and I mean
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.360]   absolutely nothing can even come close to the love of Christ.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.680]   At the time, when I was struggling, even though I thought I was free in a worldly sense, I
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.760]   was pretty miserable, and I often joked that I even couldn't get sinning right because
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.360]   I always felt like something was holding me back.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.900]   So I was a terrible Christian, and I was a terrible sinner.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.200]   So that kind of tells you how conflicted I was back then.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.880]   I didn't know it then, but today I know it was the Holy Spirit relentlessly pursuing
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.680]   and protecting me as part of His mission to complete the good work He began in me, as
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.000]   stated in Philippians 1.6.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.840]   Now today, as my wife and I transition out of the military life, God continues to remind
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.960]   us of His goodness, His holiness, and providence every single day.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.080]   He continues to be faithful and takes care of us in so many ways that I can't even begin
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.360]   to cover in this short testimony.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.120]   We'll just have to get to know each other for that one.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.320]   But as I navigate this next chapter in my life, I look forward to seeing how God will
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.480]   be glorified in my life and the lives of those around me, that's you guys, and I really look
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.040]   forward to seeing the types of miracles and the blessings that He brings upon us.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.760]   Thank you for listening to my testimony, and I pray that you are blessed by the rest of
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.400]   this service.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.320]   [applause]
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.240]   [silence]
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.240]   [silence]
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.240]   [silence]
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.240]   [silence]
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.240]   [silence]
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.240]   [silence]
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.240]   [silence]
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.240]   [silence]
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.600]   [APPLAUSE]
