[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:45.940]   - All right, good morning, church family.
[00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:46.780]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.480]   I hope you had a good week in the Lord.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.400]   As always, it's such a joy and a privilege
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.600]   for us to get together and to worship our God.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.320]   I'd like to begin by reading from Psalm 27,
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.860]   the Psalm of David, verses four to six.
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.440]   "One thing I have asked from the Lord
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.860]   "that I shall seek, that I may dwell
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.060]   "in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.520]   "to behold the beauty of the Lord
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.860]   "and to meditate in his temple.
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.560]   "For in the day of trouble,
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.360]   "he will conceal me in his tabernacle,
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.020]   "in the secret place of his tent, he will hide me.
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.400]   "He will lift me up on a rock,
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.020]   "and now my head will be lifted up
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.480]   "above my enemies around me.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.360]   "And I will offer in his tent sacrifices
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.440]   "with shouts of joy.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.140]   "I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the Lord."
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.060]   Amen.
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.360]   And with that, let us begin our worship this morning.

[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:53.500]   - All right, good morning.
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.340]   Welcome to Berean Community Church.
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.300]   Let me get to a few announcements.
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.940]   First of all, starting from today,
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.780]   as some of you guys may know,

[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.640]   So if I can ask of you, I'm sure you guys already know,
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.320]   but please do not use the side doors
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.160]   that enter into our cafe building
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.040]   because there's membership classes
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.600]   and various things going on.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.160]   So if you are dropping off your children,
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.820]   make sure you go to the other side of the building
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.520]   with the double glass doors.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.360]   So make sure you drop off the children there
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.000]   and do not use this way because again,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.800]   there's classes going on there.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.720]   So that's starting today, only during second service.

[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.720]   in this room.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.280]   Okay, even if you haven't signed up
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.680]   and you wanna participate, again,
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.320]   you can just show up and just tell Pastor Peter Chung
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.440]   when you get here that you're not signed up
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.640]   so that they can add your name to the roster
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.440]   and then whatever material that they're gonna print
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.200]   and give you is that they can be better prepared next time.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.440]   Okay, so that's happening.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.720]   This coming Saturday,
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.400]   we have all church cleaning maintenance day.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.480]   So if you have signed up, again,
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.520]   please come by nine o'clock.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.360]   And if you haven't signed up and you're able to come,

[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.720]   There will be a brief meeting to assign you
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.740]   the different tasks and more people come,
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.800]   more thorough and quicker the thing's gonna go.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.960]   And it's gonna be from nine to about 12 o'clock
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.160]   just so that you'll know what to expect
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.040]   when you get here, okay?
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.120]   And then I just wanted to give you a heads up.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.040]   This is not till May,
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.040]   but we have a softball tournament that we have annually
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.080]   for missions fundraising that's gonna be happening
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.080]   on May 18th and the week following week.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.560]   Okay, so May 18th for the men
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.760]   and the following Saturday is for the ladies.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.960]   So if you are interested in signing up for that,
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.920]   please let us know.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.800]   And so again, you'll get the information for that.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.520]   Just give you a heads up.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.320]   We have Easter coming up
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.480]   and there's a lot of things going on.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.600]   So Pastor Mark's gonna come
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.360]   and give us an announcement for that.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:12.160]   - Okay, good morning, everybody.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.000]   As you entered service this morning,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.060]   you received the invitation and info card for Easter.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.160]   So please make sure you have these.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.200]   And we wanna encourage you to use the opportunity
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.320]   to think ahead and intentionally thinking about people
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.300]   in your lives, your coworkers, classmates, et cetera,
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.240]   that you wanna reach out to evangelize
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.880]   and invite to church.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.320]   Also, as you think about that,
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.800]   our outreach team would love to pray with you.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.040]   So we're gonna put up a form just on the various platforms
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.480]   so that you can give us the info
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.240]   and we'll pray with you during this month.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:50.120]   That being said, we're gonna be planning extra EV outings
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.640]   to the local malls,
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.880]   especially the spectrum where there's a lot of people.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.480]   So please be on the lookout for the signup for that.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.640]   We're gonna be going both Saturday and Sunday
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.840]   prior to Easter.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.120]   That week, as you guys know,
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.760]   there's gonna be a lot of different events.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.640]   I'm not gonna go through each one,
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.880]   but please make sure that you have those things
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.000]   on the calendar, the devotions that are taking place
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.040]   each day.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.000]   And then on Thursday, there is a special Passover meal
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.520]   that's gonna be taking place from 6.30.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:24.520]   It'll include a dinner and reenacting the Passover elements
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.880]   that our Lord did during that time.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.600]   So if you haven't ever experienced it before,
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.440]   it just really highlights the direct line and path
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.640]   to why Christ was so important as the sacrifice of God.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.560]   So please make sure to sign up for that.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.000]   Oh, you do have to sign up early
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.520]   so that we can prepare for that event.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.160]   I wanna highlight that on Good Friday
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.200]   and the three services that are taking place on Sunday,
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.680]   there is going to be a resource booth after the services.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.680]   So if you do bring a guest,
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.960]   please make sure to swing by in the courtyard.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.320]   We would love to meet them.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.000]   Warmly, just welcome them in
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.360]   and give to them any resources they may need,
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.720]   including free Bibles and more, okay?
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.080]   All right, thanks everyone.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:16.440]   - All right, let me pray for the offering.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.880]   And again, just as a reminder,
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.280]   if you have not made the switch to Subsplash,
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.320]   that we have one more month and at the end of March,
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.760]   Zelle will be shut down.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.520]   So if you're planning to give physically,
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.720]   we have a box in the back.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.960]   Otherwise, if you guys can make the transition to Subsplash,
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.840]   it'll help our finance department
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.920]   to better track of what's going on.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.680]   And at the end of the year,
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.360]   when they have to prepare tax forms and everything,
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.240]   Subsplash is much easier to do.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.720]   So if you haven't done so,
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.520]   please do that as soon as possible.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.720]   You got one more month, okay?
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.400]   Grace, okay?
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.160]   And then after that, the law, starting from April, all right.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.200]   Let me pray for us.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.120]   And then afterwards,
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.720]   we'll give you a minute to give your offering.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.560]   Let's pray.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:04.640]   Father, we thank you so much for today.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.560]   Lord, we know what a privilege it is, Lord God,
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.800]   that we are able to have access to you,
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.920]   to worship you, Lord God,
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.200]   and to sing praise to you.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.160]   Give thanks, Lord, for everything that you've given.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.880]   Lord, we know that our life,
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.320]   that all that we have is because you've given it to us.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.600]   Help us, Lord, in recognition of your grace,
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.200]   that what we sing, what we give, and what we do
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.640]   may all be an overflow of gratitude in our hearts.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.800]   May your name be worshiped, Lord God,
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.280]   and even in this giving,
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.520]   help us to give with a cheerful heart,
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.000]   and again, may it be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.840]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.600]   (gentle piano music)

[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:43.400]   - All right, church family,
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.080]   would you please stand with us as we continue our worship?
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.480]   And as we always do, take a minute to say hello
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.240]   and greet those around you.

[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.440]   If you can turn your Bibles to Luke chapter seven,
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.720]   and we'll be reading from verse 29 to verse 35.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:29.780]   Luke chapter seven, verse 29 to 35.
[00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.900]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.640]   When all the people and the tax collectors heard this,
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.240]   they acknowledged God's justice,
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.080]   having been baptized with the baptism of John,
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.400]   but the Pharisees and the lawyers
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.280]   rejected God's purpose for themselves,
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.640]   not having been baptized by John.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.120]   To what then shall I compare the men of this generation
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.600]   and what are they like?
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.560]   They are like children who sit in the marketplace
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.240]   and call to one another, and they say,
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.080]   "We played the flute for you and you did not dance.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.620]   "We sang a dirge and you did not weep.
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.760]   "For John the Baptist has come eating no bread
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:06.460]   "and drinking no wine, and you say he has a demon.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.300]   "The Son of Man has come eating and drinking,
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.600]   "and you say behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard,
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.180]   "a friend of tax collectors and sinners,
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.440]   "yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children."
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.280]   Let's pray.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:31.480]   Father, we pray for deeper understanding,
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.080]   not simply of your words, but of your very heart.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.880]   I pray that as you have invested
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.800]   your very breath into these words,
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.560]   help us, Lord God, to see you,
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.480]   to adore you, to worship you.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.780]   I pray that what you have ordained your word to be,
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.420]   that it would sanctify us, correct us, guide us,
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.540]   that we may become more and more like Christ each day.
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.280]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:02.380]   What is the distinction, main distinction,
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.480]   between a Christian and a non-Christian?
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:09.420]   I think most of you are sophisticated enough
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.740]   and you've been a Christian long enough
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.120]   to know that a Christian isn't somebody
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.100]   just simply that comes to church, right?
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.100]   In fact, some of the harshest rebuke
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.380]   that Jesus gave were to people
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.580]   who were claiming to be worshipers of God.
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.340]   And he said, "I never knew you."
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.220]   So we know that just coming to church
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.140]   and being involved in church, serving in the church,
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:35.660]   sometimes the greatest and the most deeply deceived people
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.460]   are the people who are religious, who are in the church.
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.900]   The way Bible describes it,
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.680]   it says the God of this age is Satan.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.340]   Second Corinthians 4, three to four, it says,
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.040]   "And even if our gospel is veiled,
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.680]   "it is veiled to those who are perishing,
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.520]   "in whose case the God of this world
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.480]   "has blinded the minds of the unbelieving
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.780]   "so that they may not see the light of the gospel
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.080]   "of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God."
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.880]   So the Bible distinguishes
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.960]   between a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.600]   A non-Christian is somebody
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.040]   who their eyes have not been opened
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:10.220]   to the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.840]   to the beauty of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.800]   So when they hear the word of God,
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.040]   they don't understand it.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.160]   And just like Jesus said, like the first soil,
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.440]   because they do not comprehend what is being taught,
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.400]   they reject it.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.000]   And so nothing happens.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.920]   They move away, the word of God is taught,
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.140]   and they may remember things that they heard,
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.520]   but it never had any true effect on them.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.640]   Versus a Christian is somebody who hears
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:38.080]   and his eyes are opened to see the glory
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.720]   of the things that they've heard.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.640]   And as a result of that,
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.760]   they see the beauty, and like Paul says,
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.120]   that he desires that more than anything else in his life,
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.280]   and so he surrenders and follows Christ as a result.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.140]   So the distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.600]   is somebody who's seen the glory
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.640]   and somebody who has not seen the glory.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.000]   It's not about information,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.080]   it's not about what you do or don't do,
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.720]   but the primary distinction
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.960]   between a Christian and a non-Christian
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.240]   is have you seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.900]   or you've heard it, but you have not seen the glory.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.280]   So the fundamental question is
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.960]   what causes somebody to open his eyes?
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.080]   What causes a sinner to open his eyes
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.960]   so that he also may see the glory of the gospel?
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.680]   In Luke chapter seven, 29 to 30,
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.800]   Luke makes a distinction between the people
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.480]   and the tax collectors who were able to see
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.960]   and understand what was being taught
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:38.120]   versus the leaders, the Pharisees and the lawyers
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.200]   who were the experts of the law,
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.600]   why they were not able to understand
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.320]   and end up rejecting Christ.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.560]   It says in verse 29,
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.360]   "When all the people and the tax collectors heard this,
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.600]   "they acknowledged God's justice,"
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.720]   meaning that they were able to receive,
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.080]   that what God was doing was right, it was just,
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.920]   "having been baptized with the baptism of John.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.120]   "But the Pharisees and the lawyers
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.080]   "rejected God's purpose for themselves,
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.320]   "not having been baptized by John."
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.080]   So you see here the distinction
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.400]   between those who received John the Baptist
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.360]   and those who rejected John the Baptist,
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.200]   and then which ultimately led to receiving Jesus
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:22.040]   and rejecting Jesus was the baptism of John, right?
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.800]   That's what Luke says, that was the distinction.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.000]   The reason why the people and the tax collectors
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.360]   were able to acknowledge and accept the justice of God
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.760]   is because they were baptized by John the Baptist,
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:38.840]   and the Pharisees and the lawyers who knew all the law,
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:42.960]   who knew everything, and yet they rejected him
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.480]   is because they did not receive the baptism of John.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.400]   This morning, we wanna look at what that means.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.080]   If that's a distinction between a Christian
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.760]   and a non-Christian,
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.520]   between seeing the glory and not seeing the glory,
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.960]   what caused one to be able to see
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.160]   and what caused another not to see?
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.480]   When we say, so we need to understand
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.720]   that when he says because he received the baptism
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.600]   of John the Baptist, was there something in the water?
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.040]   Was there some special touch or power that God gave to John
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.840]   that if he touched them, that somehow their eyes were opened?
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.160]   Now obviously, that's not what he's referring to.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.000]   John the Baptist, his baptism is known as what?
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.280]   The baptism of what?
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.160]   Repentance, right?
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.600]   His baptism was baptism of repentance.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.240]   So when he says the distinction
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.800]   between a Christian and a non-Christian,
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.400]   basically he's saying the one who repents
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.320]   and the one who does not repent.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.400]   The reason why they were able to see
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:50.280]   and acknowledge God's justice is because they repented.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.520]   And the reason why the Pharisees and the lawyers
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.680]   did not see and did not reject him
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.080]   is because they did not repent.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.560]   In essence, that's what he's saying, right?
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.360]   So that is a broad outline of what we're gonna be looking at,
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.920]   repentance is what causes us to see God and his glory.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.960]   It is repentance that causes our eyes to become open.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.720]   If you notice here, in verse 29, it says,
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.320]   "When all the people and the tax collector,"
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.480]   why does he make a distinction
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.160]   between the people and the tax collector?
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.520]   Aren't tax collectors also the people, right?
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.600]   It's almost like it's all the people
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.000]   and then the other people, right?
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.280]   There's a reason why he does that.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.320]   And you see that repeated in the Gospels,
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.280]   where it was said the tax collectors were justified,
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.880]   the tax, he hung out with the tax collectors,
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.440]   that Jesus was known to hang out with sinners
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.520]   and the tax collectors.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.360]   The reason why they make the distinction
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.480]   with tax collectors is because they would have considered
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.300]   tax collectors as the vilest of sinners.
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.120]   They weren't just ordinary sinners.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.120]   These were people that universally,
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.880]   every Jew would have thought,
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.880]   if anybody deserves the harshest of punishment,
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:01.340]   the greatest of sinner would have been a tax collector.
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:06.340]   Because not only did they betray the nation of Israel,
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.040]   they basically turned the money over to the pagans
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.040]   who were suppressing them.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.880]   It was the greatest betrayal of God himself.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.920]   That's how they looked at it.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.500]   And so when he says that even the people,
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.540]   even the vilest of sinners,
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.640]   that they were able to open their eyes,
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.880]   and when they heard the word of God,
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.380]   they recognized it and said, God is just.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:33.040]   Why were they able to open their eyes?
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:37.400]   It says because they received a baptism of repentance.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:42.820]   Baptism and repentance cannot be separated.
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:48.080]   There's reasons why we don't practice infant baptism,
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.400]   because baptism and repentance
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.000]   are supposed to go hand in hand.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.840]   Our baptism was handed down from John the Baptist,
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.560]   was a baptism of repentance.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.680]   Jesus baptized with baptism of repentance.
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.160]   The apostles practiced the baptism of repentance.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.920]   The early church practiced the baptism of repentance.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.080]   So an infant cannot practice repentance.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.360]   Baptism was not a sprinkling of a symbol
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.280]   of God's grace in your life.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.760]   It was when a person repented.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.800]   That's why when Peter in Acts chapter two stands up
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.240]   and he begins to preach about Christ
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.200]   in front of the same people who crucified Jesus,
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.640]   he said, you crucified the author of life.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.080]   You crucified the Messiah.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.400]   I mean, he didn't hold back.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.760]   And those who were convicted, they said, what should we do?
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:43.520]   Peter says, repent and be baptized.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.280]   Repent and be baptized.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.520]   That's why you see, oftentimes,
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.220]   we have people who are up here who will give their testimony
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:51.620]   and every once in a while you'll hear,
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.080]   I was baptized when I was 10.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.600]   I was baptized when I was third grade.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.000]   I was baptized when I was in high school.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.400]   And then they'll qualify, but I never repented.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:03.080]   So because they never repented,
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.340]   that baptism didn't mean anything.
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.140]   Because baptism and repentance
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.920]   are supposed to go hand in hand.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.320]   And that's exactly what John the Baptist taught.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.360]   He preached baptism of repentance.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:20.360]   So baptism, or repentance in the Greek means metanoia.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.860]   Literally, it means to change your mind.
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:26.760]   That there is a radical change that happens in you.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.360]   And again, it's not just the way you think,
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:32.120]   that because there was a radical transformation
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.480]   of what you thought was right
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.380]   and what you thought was good
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.760]   and what you thought was bad,
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.680]   that you changed your mind.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.080]   So therefore, your life conformed
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:44.120]   to what has happened to you.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.680]   So it's more than just your thinking.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.400]   Your life is beginning to,
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:52.820]   you begin to live your life according to your repentance.
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:56.340]   In Luke chapter three, three to six,
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:01.960]   John the Baptist and his ministry
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.800]   and his preaching is laid out for us,
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.700]   and it describes what repentance looks like.
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:10.480]   And he came into all the district around the Jordan,
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.440]   preaching a baptism of repentance
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.840]   for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:17.240]   I want you to let that sink in,
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:19.200]   because when he says they weren't baptized,
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.800]   it's because they didn't repent.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:25.440]   But John the Baptist was preaching repentance
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.960]   and the forgiveness of sins,
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.560]   as it is written in the book of the words
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.400]   of Isaiah the prophet,
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.040]   the voice of one crying in the wilderness,
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.480]   make ready the way of the Lord,
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.920]   make his path straight.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.680]   Repentance is basically,
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:40.600]   is what lays the road that Christ can come to us
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:41.760]   and we can go to Christ.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.280]   That's what repentance does.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.400]   The obstacle that existed between us and God,
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.920]   through repentance,
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.840]   is straightened so that we can get to Christ.
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.640]   Verse five, every ravine will be filled
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.080]   and every mountain and hill will be brought low.
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.940]   The crooked will become straight
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.560]   and rough roads smooth.
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.400]   And then he says,
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.240]   and all flesh will see the salvation of God.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:07.080]   So what we see in verse four through five,
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.960]   is what repentance looks like.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.120]   John the Baptist says,
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.400]   repent and receive the forgiveness of sin
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.320]   in order to make the path straight to Christ.
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:20.040]   And so whatever was high,
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.460]   that caused you to not be able to get to Christ.
[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:23.960]   Whatever was low,
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.520]   that needs to be filled.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:29.160]   Basically, repentance is what causes us to get to Christ.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.120]   To get rid of our things in our life,
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.080]   he's saying these are things,
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.880]   they're obstacles to get to Christ.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.720]   And he says,
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.580]   when you repent,
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:37.420]   he says,
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:40.120]   all flesh will see the salvation of God.
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:45.020]   The reason why the tax collector,
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.780]   the vilest of sinners,
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:49.140]   were able to see the glory,
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.680]   is because he was repentant.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.860]   Not because of his deeds,
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.420]   not because of many years of learning,
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.380]   simply because he repented.
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.580]   In second Timothy three,
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:01.420]   seven through eight,
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.260]   he says,
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:03.780]   always learning but never able to come
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.300]   to the knowledge of truth.
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:09.900]   Our churches are filled with people
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.180]   who are active at church but never repented.
[00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.520]   Never repented.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:19.720]   Because they still live their lives for themselves.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.120]   Their life doesn't look any different
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:22.960]   than a non-Christian,
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.260]   other than the fact that they go to church.
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:30.040]   They're still pursuing money like anybody else.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:34.020]   They still value the same thing like anybody else.
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.280]   Nothing has changed.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.860]   There was no real repentance.
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.980]   And the way that the gospel is preached
[00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:43.000]   in our generation is,
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.700]   would you accept Jesus?
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:45.620]   Accept him.
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:48.380]   As if God is the beggar.
[00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.540]   And we are the one in charge.
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:51.380]   We are the ones that,
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:52.200]   okay, what do you got?
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.040]   Like, we're shoppers.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.100]   We're going to the mall and let's see,
[00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:56.780]   let's see what God has for me.
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.740]   And so, so many people who make decisions for Jesus
[00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.060]   walk away because,
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:02.080]   kind of like,
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:02.920]   you know,
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.740]   buyer's remorse.
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:05.700]   Like, I gave him a chance
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.440]   but my life didn't turn out the way I wanted.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.280]   It's like,
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.120]   why?
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.100]   Because of the way the gospel was presented.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.580]   Give him a chance.
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.540]   We're the ones who offended him.
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:16.660]   He's the one angry with us.
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:17.500]   He's the judge.
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:18.320]   He's the creator.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.440]   We came from him.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.380]   And yet, the way the gospel was presented,
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:24.540]   gave him a chance.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.460]   Asking the sinners.
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:30.500]   Almost like God is asking for forgiveness.
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.340]   And as a result of that,
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.120]   there was no true repentance.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.900]   Give him a chance.
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:37.740]   Accept him.
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.100]   Receive him into your heart.
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:43.400]   That is not the message that we hear in the New Testament.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.500]   The message that John the Baptist preached
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.000]   and the message that Jesus preached
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.580]   when he came on the scene was what?
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:52.780]   Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:57.140]   Repent to turn from your sins.
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.020]   To turn from your sins.
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:02.440]   That you may have a straight path toward Christ.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:06.060]   That you may see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:09.060]   It wasn't simply that they didn't understand.
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.980]   In Romans chapter one it says they didn't understand
[00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:12.780]   'cause they didn't wanna understand.
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.860]   They're very selective hearing.
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:18.200]   The scripture says because they love the darkness
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.040]   rather than the light,
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.620]   they chose to suppress the truth.
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.660]   And so the reason why they weren't able to see
[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:24.940]   the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.260]   they were unwilling to repent.
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:31.060]   They want to have Christ and the world too.
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.920]   And as a result of that, they're always learning.
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:36.900]   And they could regurgitate information
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:38.060]   they heard about Christ.
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.780]   They can tell you what the verses mean.
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:41.900]   They can tell you systematic theology.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:46.340]   They may even be teachers, but they don't know Christ.
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.220]   They don't understand when Paul says
[00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:51.500]   in light of the surpassing knowledge of known Jesus Christ,
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:53.500]   everything became rubbish to me.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.140]   It never became rubbish to them.
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:57.740]   The same things that they were tempted by
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:58.740]   before they met Christ,
[00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:01.500]   the same things that they're tempted today.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.540]   Because Christ is theoretically better,
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.180]   but in reality, he's not.
[00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.940]   Theologically, we say he's better,
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.060]   but in reality, he's not.
[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:14.720]   I am more tempted by what my money can buy
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.700]   than the promises of Christ.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.420]   I am looking more forward to the money that I save
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:20.900]   for the vacation that I'm going
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.920]   than the second coming of Christ.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.620]   Because they're always learning,
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.500]   but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.100]   is because they never repented.
[00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:33.340]   They never turned from their sin.
[00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:36.340]   They acknowledged Jesus, they accepted Jesus,
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:39.460]   but they never repented of their sins.
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:40.980]   That is what the scripture says,
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.380]   the distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:46.580]   is one who repented and the one who did not repent.
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:50.860]   It is those who receive the word of God,
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:54.220]   and even the vile of sinners like the tax collectors,
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:57.540]   their eyes became open and they heard God.
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:03.180]   In contrast, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law,
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:05.940]   because they would not repent,
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.020]   they wouldn't acknowledge his justice.
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.140]   They couldn't see, or they didn't see.
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:13.580]   Now, you have to understand who the Pharisees were.
[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:15.740]   If you asked a first century Jew,
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.340]   you had a question about the law,
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.220]   what is right, what is wrong?
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.860]   If I wanted to learn how to pray and evangelize,
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:24.780]   if I wanted to go to the temple and give many sacrifices,
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.920]   where would they go to seek counsel?
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.740]   It would have been the Pharisees.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.900]   It would have been the teachers of the law.
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:37.420]   The teachers of the law, 24/7, was constantly debating,
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.280]   what did Moses mean by this?
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:41.260]   What did Elijah mean?
[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.180]   Who's the greatest prophet?
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:43.180]   What's the greatest verse?
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.420]   What's the greatest law?
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:49.020]   They were constantly expositing the Old Testament.
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:52.180]   Pharisees were actually proselytizing.
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:56.040]   They were fasting twice a week.
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:58.700]   How many people do you know who fast twice a week?
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:02.420]   They were giving tithing of everything that they had.
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:04.960]   They kept the law meticulously.
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.840]   So if there's anybody that they would have thought
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:10.120]   was closer to God than the rest of the people,
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.480]   they would have put the Pharisees and the lawyers here
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.200]   and the tax collectors down here.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:19.160]   But you see what Luke is doing, he's flipping the switch.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.680]   That these vilest of sinners were able to hear God,
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:27.680]   but these leaders could not recognize the voice of God.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.160]   And the reason that we are given this
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.160]   is that they did not repent.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.820]   They refused to repent.
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.680]   In Matthew 23, two to three, it says saying,
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.740]   "The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves
[00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.220]   "in the chair of Moses.
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:45.060]   "Therefore, all that they tell you, do and observe."
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:48.340]   Meaning that they know the law, they know the Bible.
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:50.460]   So when they tell you about the Messiah,
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.680]   when they tell you this and that, he says,
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.320]   "Listen to them because they've studied."
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:57.860]   But he says, "But do not do according to their deeds,
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:00.660]   "for they say things and do not do them."
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:06.460]   It is a dangerous place to be,
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:11.040]   to be a teacher of the word of God and not practice it.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:15.400]   We have too many people who lead with their mouth
[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.460]   and not with their lives.
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:20.140]   And that's exactly what the Pharisees were doing.
[00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:23.620]   They got in the position of honor to lead,
[00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:25.220]   but it was all with their mouth,
[00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:27.700]   with knowledge and giftedness.
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:31.720]   And he says, "Listen to them, but don't follow them."
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.080]   The reason why they were constantly learning
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:38.380]   but not able to understand is because they did not repent.
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:41.260]   So the question that we have is what causes somebody,
[00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:44.260]   what causes somebody who should have known better?
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:47.340]   What causes somebody who had all the knowledge,
[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.700]   who should have been the closest,
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.980]   had the front row seat to the glory of God,
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:54.020]   became this blind?
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:57.180]   I'm gonna give you three things that I believe
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.660]   that causes us to be spiritually blind.
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:02.060]   One is familiarity.
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:06.060]   We become callous to anything that we do repeatedly.
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:09.440]   I think most of us, if you've been a Christian
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.660]   for any period of time, you know how you were
[00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:15.520]   when you first began to sing these gospel songs,
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:17.460]   when you first repented, what it meant to you,
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:18.740]   what it meant for you to come to church,
[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.940]   what it meant for you to open up the Bible.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.660]   But after a while, you become callous to these things.
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.540]   You're singing these songs, but you're just singing.
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.940]   You're not praising, you're not worshiping God.
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:30.340]   You're putting in your time.
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:35.020]   C.S. Lewis says, "None are so unholy as those
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:38.460]   "whose hands are cauterized with the holy things.
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:42.660]   "Sacred things become profane by becoming matters of a job.
[00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.920]   "I've always been glad myself that theology
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.780]   "is not the thing that I earn my living by."
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:52.040]   The person who is in the greatest danger of this
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:57.040]   in this church is me, because this is my job.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:01.300]   I'm in front of the Bible all week long, all week long.
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.460]   I'm there constantly going through the scripture,
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:05.100]   preparing sermon, doing Bible study,
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.780]   talking to people about God, and as a result of that,
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:13.100]   I can easily become cauterized, desensitized.
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:16.380]   So I can preach great things of God,
[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:18.420]   and the sacred things are no longer sacred to me.
[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.880]   I can become inoculated to the truth.
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.820]   When you come to church every single Sunday,
[00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:26.780]   and you hear and not act,
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:29.180]   when you get convicted and you don't repent,
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.920]   you are also being cauterized.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:35.840]   Your ability to listen and to turn to Christ
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.420]   becomes harder and harder and harder
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:42.240]   every single year you live without repentance,
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:46.020]   to the point where you can have
[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.140]   the greatest preacher of our generation,
[00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:51.540]   you can have Jesus himself come and preach
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:53.480]   and say, "That's not from God,"
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:57.620]   because you become so desensitized to the truth.
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:01.500]   When singing becomes ritual,
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.500]   when worship becomes putting in your time,
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.660]   you have become inoculated by the truth,
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:08.620]   and that's exactly what happened to the Pharisees
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:10.540]   and the teachers of the law.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:13.140]   Even though they knew more than anybody else,
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:18.140]   they were blinder, more blind than even the tax collectors.
[00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:22.460]   The second reason why people become dull to hearing
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:26.260]   is because of self-righteousness, self-righteousness.
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.620]   Instead of seeking true righteousness, self-righteousness.
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:31.060]   Self-righteousness is always produced
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:34.340]   when comparing themselves with other sinners.
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:38.260]   You see somebody who's doing the right thing,
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.980]   or trying to do the right thing,
[00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.860]   but they never repent, there's no need to repent,
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:47.620]   because their sinner's always worse than them.
[00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:49.060]   So whenever they talk about their sin,
[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:51.260]   but I'm not as bad as them, I know I'm not perfect,
[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:54.100]   but I'm not as bad as them, that's self-righteousness.
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.660]   There's no true repentance in somebody
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:02.060]   who immediately turns their attention to a greater sinner.
[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:04.100]   I know I'm not perfect, I know I'm not good,
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.140]   I know I shouldn't be doing that,
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.700]   but I'm not as bad as them, that's self-righteousness,
[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.740]   that's not repentance.
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:12.660]   You acknowledge what you did was wrong,
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:14.420]   but you didn't repent.
[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:17.740]   Self-righteousness always is more concerned
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:21.340]   about other people's sins than themselves.
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.700]   You ever see somebody who gets on a righteous cause,
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.980]   and the very next thing that they do
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:29.280]   is what is wrong with everybody else?
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.660]   Everything that comes out of their mouth
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:33.580]   is what is wrong with everybody else?
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.140]   That's not a repentant sinner.
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:38.420]   In Psalm 139, 23 to 24, it says,
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:40.460]   "Search me, O God, and know my heart,
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:42.860]   "try me, and know my anxious thoughts,
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:45.560]   "and see if there's any hurtful way in me,
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.860]   "and lead me in the everlasting way."
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.740]   But a self-righteous person,
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:55.220]   immediately after he acknowledges, yes, I was wrong,
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:58.420]   why is everybody, why don't they see it?
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:48:59.780]   How come they don't see it?
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:05.980]   I remember during a period of the BLM marches,
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:08.200]   all of a sudden, everybody opened their eyes,
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.180]   like, we're all racist.
[00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:12.660]   And they said, you know, I repent of my racism.
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:14.100]   And the next thing you heard was,
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.140]   why isn't everybody repenting of racism?
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:20.140]   So they were more outraged that other people
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.940]   weren't repenting like they were repenting.
[00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:24.780]   That's not repentance.
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:28.100]   A repentant person is beating his chest.
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:30.580]   A repentant person cannot lift his eyes
[00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:34.000]   because he is so aware of his own faults.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.480]   A repentant person doesn't say, I was bad,
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.180]   but what's wrong with you, why don't you see it?
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.420]   That's self-righteousness.
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:44.460]   That's not repentance.
[00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:48.260]   And it causes them to become blind to their own sin.
[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:51.140]   A self-righteous person is always more disgusted
[00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:55.240]   by other people's sins than they are of their own.
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.740]   We all say, yes, I'm not perfect,
[00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:59.260]   but I'm not as bad as them.
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:00.660]   So they're more bothered.
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:02.620]   The words that come out of their mouth
[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:05.180]   always is about other people,
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:06.500]   why other people don't see it,
[00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:07.940]   why other people don't live this way,
[00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:10.300]   why other people are not doing what I'm doing.
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:13.500]   And so they become proud.
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:16.660]   And as a result of that, in James chapter 4, 6,
[00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:18.780]   is that therefore it says God is opposed to the proud,
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:21.020]   but gives grace to the humble.
[00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:25.180]   Because they are unwilling to see
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:27.200]   their own sins as God sees them.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:31.100]   Even their repentance is superficial.
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.840]   Even their repentance is, look what I've done,
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.580]   and now come, you're not doing it.
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:37.020]   In Luke chapter 3, 7, through 8 it says,
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:38.300]   so he began saying to the crowds
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:40.420]   who were going out to be baptized by him,
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:41.660]   you brood of vipers,
[00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:44.580]   who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:47.580]   Therefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance,
[00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:49.460]   and do not begin to say to yourselves,
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:51.000]   we have Abraham for our fathers,
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.480]   for I say to you that from these stones,
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.660]   God is able to raise up children to Abraham.
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:01.580]   He says, these Pharisees and the Sadducees,
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:02.600]   we know the law.
[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:07.040]   We come from a line of faithful Jews.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.180]   And so as a result of that,
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:10.260]   because I'm a member of the church,
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:11.620]   I used to be a Sunday school teacher,
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:13.420]   I grew up in the church, I know the Bible,
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:15.940]   I studied that passage, I used to disciple people.
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:21.020]   As a result of that, they are blind to their own sins.
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:27.000]   We make our sins always more favorable than others.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.020]   And ultimately, we make excuses.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:34.300]   If we are unwilling to repent,
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.980]   we have to justify our own sins.
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:43.100]   Hear me clearly, God justifies a repentant sinner,
[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.440]   but he will never justify the sin.
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:50.920]   An unrepentant sinner always tries to justify his sin.
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:54.120]   Let me say that again.
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:58.020]   God calls us in repentance to justify a sinner
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:59.620]   by the blood of Christ.
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:02.660]   But an unrepentant sinner will always justify his own sin.
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:05.300]   There's always a reason for his sin.
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:07.660]   In Luke 7, 31 to 34, he says,
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:10.220]   to what then shall I compare the men of this generation?
[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:11.180]   And what are they like?
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:13.380]   They are like children who sit in the marketplace
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:15.900]   and call to one another, and they say,
[00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.420]   we play the flute for you, and you did not dance,
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:20.800]   and we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.980]   For John the Baptist has come eating no bread
[00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:27.620]   and drinking no wine, and you say he has a demon.
[00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:29.720]   The son of man has come eating and drinking,
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:32.060]   and you say, behold, a gluttonous man and a drunkard,
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:34.020]   a friend of tax collectors and sinners.
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:37.060]   In other words, every opportunity was given to you.
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:43.020]   If you needed a dirge, hardship in life,
[00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:45.020]   that possibly that will cause you
[00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:47.300]   to take your sin seriously.
[00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:52.140]   Or the promise of joy, promise of his grace.
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:55.140]   So whether it is a harsh sermon,
[00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:57.020]   or whether it is a light sermon,
[00:52:57.020 --> 00:53:00.340]   the end result is no repentance either way.
[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:03.940]   No matter what you hear and say,
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:05.700]   well, if your preaching was this way,
[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:07.060]   maybe I would repent.
[00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:08.620]   No.
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:11.020]   He said, you've heard both.
[00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:14.700]   You've heard grace, and you've heard warning,
[00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:15.760]   and you never came.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:19.900]   And the reason why is because when John the Baptist came,
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:21.380]   he said, because he didn't like his message,
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:22.460]   and his message was the same.
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:25.240]   Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.560]   Bear fruit in accordance to repentance.
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:29.460]   And they said, oh, that guy's a demon.
[00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:33.000]   He's a demon.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.540]   So why are we gonna listen to a demon?
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:36.800]   So the quickest way,
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.160]   quickest way to nullify his message
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:40.560]   is nullify the messenger.
[00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:44.080]   And then Jesus comes, and he was drinking and eating,
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:45.840]   and he says, he's hanging out with the tax collectors.
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:47.760]   He's a sinner.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.760]   So because he's a sinner, and because he's a demon,
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.680]   whatever they say doesn't matter,
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:54.760]   'cause he can't be from God.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:59.460]   So the easiest way to remove yourself
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:00.800]   from the guilt of sin
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:05.760]   is to disqualify the one who's bringing the message.
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:08.120]   You know how that happens today in our culture?
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:10.560]   Oh, that's legalistic.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:14.680]   Anything that we don't like,
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.760]   you call it legalism, and you don't need to listen to it.
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.840]   The question should be, is it biblical?
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:23.760]   Question should be, does the Bible teach that?
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:26.420]   The question should be, is it accurate?
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:29.160]   But once we label something legalism,
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:30.880]   oh, that's, we can't listen to that.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:31.960]   Why is it legalistic?
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.800]   'Cause I don't like it.
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:34.860]   At the end, that's what you're saying.
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:35.700]   I don't like it.
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:36.600]   I don't agree with you.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:37.960]   I don't like the standard.
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:40.640]   And so as a result, if you call it legalism,
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.080]   you don't need to listen to anything that comes out.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.120]   So if they don't like what I say,
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.860]   Pastor Peter is like that.
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:47.200]   Or you don't like what the church says,
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.800]   like that, Berean is like that.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:52.100]   But the question is, what does the Bible say?
[00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:56.160]   So he says the reason why the Pharisees
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:59.680]   and these teachers of the law did not see,
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.060]   did not understand is because they,
[00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:05.000]   at the end, refused to repent.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.040]   Refused to repent.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.360]   You can be at church all your life,
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:13.060]   and you never repented.
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.300]   I said, what do you mean I didn't repent?
[00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:19.760]   I raised my hand, I was sorrowful, and I made a prayer.
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:24.060]   Repentance isn't simply repenting over one act
[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:26.340]   or certain acts.
[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:30.420]   Repentance is a rebellion that we lived under,
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:31.760]   that we were born into.
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:35.600]   I want you to hear this very clearly,
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:37.540]   because sometimes we think repentance is like,
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:39.500]   if you watch porn, I repented.
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:43.340]   I lied and embezzled a business, so I repented.
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:48.140]   Repentance that justified is returning your life
[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:50.580]   from rebellion to obedience.
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:55.840]   Living a life independent of God to pursue your own life
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:57.580]   versus surrendering your life to Christ,
[00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:58.980]   that's what repentance ultimately is,
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:03.120]   because what brought the judgment of sin to mankind?
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:06.680]   We say sin, but what was the sin?
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:12.540]   Eve ate from the tree that she wasn't supposed to eat.
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:15.960]   That was it.
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:16.860]   That was it.
[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:19.660]   That was the rebellion that brought judgment to mankind.
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:24.940]   They simply ate what God told them not to eat.
[00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:29.300]   That, that's what brought the judgment of mankind?
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:30.580]   So that doesn't seem that,
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:32.780]   when's the last time you repented of eating?
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:35.100]   Right?
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:36.880]   Oh, I ate a hamburger, I need to repent.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:39.220]   God didn't want me to eat that, so I, you know,
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:41.920]   I hope that mankind doesn't get judged for this.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:46.820]   What was it about that sin that was so hideous
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:49.340]   that the judgment came into all of mankind?
[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:52.920]   Even though it seems innocent,
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:57.300]   that little sin was a rebellion against God
[00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:00.620]   that I'm going to live my life the way I want to live.
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:05.840]   A rebellious life doesn't have to be shaking his fist
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.540]   and hang a cross upside down and be a Satan worshiper.
[00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:11.700]   A rebellious life is simply,
[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.260]   I'm going to pursue what makes me happy.
[00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:18.740]   I'm going to desire what I desire.
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:23.740]   I come to church, I'll do some things to be religious,
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:26.400]   but you've never surrendered your life to Christ.
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:29.720]   So you're always learning,
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:33.100]   but it's never your testimony
[00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:35.460]   that I want Christ above everything else,
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:37.520]   because maybe you've never seen the glory
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.820]   of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:42.600]   The word glory basically means the beauty, the weight.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.760]   What attracts us is his glory.
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:48.720]   What causes us to want to see him come back
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.640]   is because we want to see his glory up close.
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:52.920]   Why we want to go to heaven
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:54.960]   is because we want to be near to his glory.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:58.560]   What causes us to worship is because we saw his glory.
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:03.360]   But somebody who has never seen the beauty of Christ,
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:06.000]   because he never really repented,
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:10.140]   he, to this day, coveting everything that the world covets.
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:14.240]   Everything that the world says is good,
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.200]   you still agree,
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:19.080]   and you're pursuing everything that the world pursues,
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:21.440]   and then you just sprinkle Jesus on everything.
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:26.520]   So you don't understand why missionaries
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:28.600]   would pack their bags and take their children
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:32.000]   into remotest parts of jungle to share the gospel.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.440]   You admire them, you praise them,
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:36.400]   but you don't really understand
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.720]   why somebody would choose the lesser job
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.800]   over a high-paying job,
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:43.240]   because he thinks it's going to bring greater glory to God.
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.200]   You don't understand.
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:47.200]   You admire them, you praise them, but you don't understand.
[00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:51.120]   You're always learning, but never able to come to the truth
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:54.060]   because you never truly repented.
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:58.360]   And the way that we justify all of that,
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:00.240]   we nullify it.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.080]   I don't agree with that.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:03.080]   I don't think that's what the Bible says.
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:08.000]   Unrepentant person will always justify his own sins.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.600]   Why I do what I do is because of this, because of that.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:13.140]   You don't understand what my mom did to me.
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:16.080]   You don't know the trauma that the church has caused.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.340]   You don't realize what I know.
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:19.720]   You don't realize what's happened to me.
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:22.680]   And so as a result of that, you're justifying your sins.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:24.280]   I'm doing what I'm doing
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:26.420]   because these things have happened to me.
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:29.800]   Paul says, "I love because he first loved me."
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:33.280]   A vile sinner.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.480]   So I don't hurt people because they hurt me.
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:37.720]   I don't sin because somebody sinned against me.
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:39.200]   Christ breaks into that and says,
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.720]   "No, I love because he first loved me,
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:43.660]   because the love that he gave me
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:45.460]   is much greater than whatever trauma
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:48.620]   you have experienced in this world."
[00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:52.020]   So a Christian whose eyes have been open and repentant
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:55.780]   can no longer say, "I sinned because they did this to me."
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:58.700]   No, I pursue Christ and worship Christ
[00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:00.940]   because of what Christ did for me.
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:03.680]   But an unrepentant sinner can never say that.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:08.320]   An unrepentant sinner wishes
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.780]   that God would bless your endeavor,
[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:12.640]   the life that you have chosen,
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.160]   and continues to live
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:17.380]   whatever brings the greatest pleasure in your life.
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.980]   And it may not look like rebellion,
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:21.380]   it may not look like a vile sin,
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.200]   but at the core of your heart,
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:25.480]   you've never surrendered your life to Christ.
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:30.940]   And as a result of that, you learn, you study,
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:33.840]   you memorize, and you're busy,
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:39.460]   but you never come to true knowledge of Christ.
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.380]   Your love for Jesus is no deeper than it was
[01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:42.540]   when you first started.
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.780]   In fact, it's probably much less.
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:52.460]   You notice how when other people slander us,
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:54.460]   we're wronged and they need to repent,
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:55.700]   but when we slander other people,
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:58.800]   we're just being honest, right?
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.100]   We're just being honest, we're being truthful.
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:05.540]   You know where this is seen most obviously?
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.560]   Is the way people talk about abortion.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:13.560]   When that child is inconvenient, it's no longer a baby.
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:19.320]   When that child is inconvenient
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.140]   because of the things that they covet in life,
[01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:24.540]   the standard of living that they have chosen for their life,
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:25.680]   that they must have,
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:29.760]   and this child is going to somehow get in the way,
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.660]   it's a tissue.
[01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:34.200]   But the moment they want that child that's a baby,
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.800]   it's precious.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:41.800]   And just by simply changing the term of how you use,
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.620]   how you address that child,
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:48.220]   you can kill it or you can adore it.
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:53.820]   You can go to prison for double murder for killing a child,
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.100]   if you call it a child.
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:59.880]   But if you simply want to discard it,
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:02.140]   we have people in our generation that says
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:04.440]   they want to make it legal to even kill a child,
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:07.220]   even after it's born, if the intention was to kill a child,
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:08.800]   they can kill the child.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:13.340]   That's how far this evil can go.
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:15.260]   The scripture says in Jeremiah 79,
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:17.760]   the heart is more deceitful than all else
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:18.900]   and is desperately sick.
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.920]   Who can understand it?
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:27.760]   That we can call murder something inconvenient.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:32.060]   That's how sick our heart is.
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.940]   That's how easily we can be deceived.
[01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:38.240]   Now, most of us may not go this far,
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:44.380]   but that deception doesn't only happen at this extreme.
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:47.340]   It happens at every turn.
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:51.840]   Where we're judging people, there's pride in our heart,
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.540]   there's bitterness, there's judgmentalism,
[01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:56.580]   and all of that is excused
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:58.640]   because our heart is corrupting at the end
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:01.140]   because we refuse to repent.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.260]   Instead of allowing the word of God
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:06.020]   to judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart,
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:07.900]   we turn the word of God into a judge
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:10.960]   and the thoughts and intention of their hearts.
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:14.540]   And as a result of that, we remain blind.
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:17.200]   We remain blind.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:21.580]   God calls us to acknowledge our sin.
[01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:25.000]   Without repentance, you cannot see God.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.460]   Just by studying the word of God
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:28.560]   doesn't cause you to see God.
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.080]   Just by being an expert of the law
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.040]   doesn't cause you to see God.
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.260]   Just because you are active in the church
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:35.820]   doesn't cause you to see God.
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:39.020]   Just because you claim to be a Christian for 40 years
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:41.260]   doesn't cause you to see God.
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:46.460]   Only way to see God is if you repent of your sins
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:49.280]   and you make the path straight.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.800]   The scripture says,
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.820]   "Broad is the way that leads to destruction.
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:58.640]   "Narrow and difficult is the path that leads to life."
[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:03.260]   John Owen says, "He that hath slight thoughts of sin
[01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:05.200]   "never had great thoughts of God."
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:08.660]   In other words, he never saw God.
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:13.100]   He never saw the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:14.420]   He just admired him.
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:16.920]   Said, "That's a great story."
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:21.040]   But they choose to covet.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.240]   They choose to pursue.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:25.440]   They choose to allow impurity in their life.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:28.300]   But they don't know God.
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.940]   The scripture says, "All have sinned and fall short
[01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:34.220]   "of the glory of Jesus Christ, or glory of God."
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:35.700]   Sin is not determined
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.700]   by whether you were born into it or not.
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:40.500]   Oftentimes they'll excuse homosexuality,
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:41.620]   saying, "Well, we were born that way,
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.960]   "so therefore it's not sin."
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.640]   Guess what?
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.480]   Guess what?
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.620]   Liars were born liars.
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.660]   Murderers were born murderers.
[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:55.380]   Everything that I do, every sin that we commit,
[01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:57.920]   the scripture says, "Because all have sinned
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.500]   "from the glory of God."
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:03.340]   So even heterosexual sin is sin.
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:07.660]   Just because you're born into it doesn't make it not sin,
[01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:09.220]   whether that's true or not.
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:12.380]   Just because you have an inclination toward that
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:14.180]   doesn't make it not sin.
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:17.340]   It's a modern day of justifying our sins.
[01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:21.640]   Sin is sin because our hearts are corrupt,
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.480]   even from our mother's womb.
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:27.340]   So when we repent, we're not just repenting of an act.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.960]   We're repenting of our rebellion against God.
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.560]   You and I were created to be the image bearers of God.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:37.780]   But when we choose to live our life for our own pleasure,
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:40.640]   for our own glory, we are in rebellion against God,
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.480]   no matter how innocent that looks.
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.220]   We are in rebellion against God.
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:46.680]   There is no repentance.
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.760]   So therefore, if somebody who's unrepentant
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:53.840]   hears this message, and those of you who refuse to repent
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:56.340]   are probably irritated by what I'm saying.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.080]   It's like somebody who wants to sleep
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.760]   and I keep turning the light on.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:03.600]   Turn off the light, turn off the light.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.200]   Only those will thank me if you have to go to work.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.740]   You might not like it, but I did you a favor,
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:10.580]   'cause you gotta go to work.
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:13.360]   You're gonna get fired if you don't go to work.
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:15.600]   But those who want to remain in the bed,
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:20.880]   turn the light off, 'cause you're irritated.
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:25.760]   God calls us to repent.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:29.040]   A sin is not simply a mistake.
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:31.800]   Sin is a rebellion against God.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:35.160]   In Psalm 51, two to six, it says,
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.960]   "Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.520]   "and cleanse me from my sin,
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:41.640]   "for I know my transgressions and my sin is ever before me.
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:43.800]   "Against you, you only, I have sinned
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.740]   "and done what is evil in your sight,
[01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:47.640]   "so that you are justified when you speak
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:48.960]   "and blameless when you judge.
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.940]   "Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,
[01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:54.440]   "and in sin, my mother conceived me."
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:59.860]   Jesus said, "He who finds his life will lose it,
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:02.960]   "and he who loses his life will find it."
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:06.420]   Now, it's such a profound statement,
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:11.000]   but the whole world dedicates their life
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.440]   to find better life.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:18.540]   Everything that we do is in pursuit of better life.
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:20.060]   People immigrate into this country
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:22.020]   because they think they're gonna have a better life.
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:23.980]   You get education so that you can have a better life.
[01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:25.340]   You make investments, buy a house
[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:26.800]   so that you can have a better life,
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.480]   for you and for your children.
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:32.900]   The whole world functions on this principle.
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.180]   We have, according to the concept,
[01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:39.860]   we have inalienable rights to pursue a better life,
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:43.800]   but Jesus says, "Those who pursue their life will lose it,
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:47.100]   "and those who surrender their life for my sake
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:48.100]   "will find it."
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:51.380]   You know how true that is.
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:56.320]   If you ask somebody who's lived a long life,
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.080]   let's say 60, 70 years,
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:00.540]   and they spent their whole life,
[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:02.100]   there's not a single person in this world
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:04.120]   that naturally doesn't want to have a better life.
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.900]   They pursued all their life for a better life,
[01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:08.660]   so you would think at the end of their life,
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:10.360]   they would be the happiest people.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:12.960]   They would be the most satisfied people
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.700]   because they dedicated decades of their life
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:17.000]   pursuing better life.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.460]   But if you ask them, "At what age
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:22.340]   "would you like to turn the clock back?"
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.540]   They always turn it back to the beginning,
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:30.260]   before they started to pursue this rat race,
[01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:34.020]   before they were consumed with coveting.
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:40.140]   If pursuit of this life is going to bring true happiness,
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:42.000]   a better life, a peaceful life,
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.100]   shouldn't the oldest people say,
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:48.660]   "I have achieved," at least a larger percentage of them
[01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:51.600]   would say, "I've gotten it."
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:54.500]   Or at least they would be happier than the younger people.
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:58.460]   But they always say, "I wish I was younger,"
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:02.160]   before they started pursuing
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.360]   what they thought was gonna make them happy.
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:08.400]   God's statement is proven over and over again
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.000]   in every single life who's in rebellion against God.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.280]   He said he has come to give life
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:15.520]   and to give this life abundantly.
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:19.200]   And to know this life, you must repent of your old life
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.840]   and receive the new life of Christ
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.640]   so that you may have true life.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:27.200]   Not this artificial life when you experience
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.880]   by the moment you become thirsty again
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:30.160]   and you become hungry again.
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.660]   But he says, "If you drink of my water,
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:34.760]   "if you eat of my bread, you will never thirst,
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:35.960]   "you will never hunger."
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:40.480]   The path to that life is repentance,
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:45.120]   not acceptance, repentance.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:51.360]   Turn from your old life, empty way of life,
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:55.200]   the coveting the world, that if I have a better job,
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.920]   if I had more money, if I was more stable,
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.480]   if I can buy a better house,
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.320]   and at the end of this journey,
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:03.080]   you said, "I wish I was 20 something."
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:09.860]   'Cause that whole path of life led to misery.
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:15.320]   Why wait to the end of your life
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:18.320]   to repeat the same confession that every single person
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.600]   who has ever lived this earth
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.200]   will tell you again and again?
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.000]   Give your life to Christ.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.340]   Repent that you may see the glory
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:29.680]   of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:32.200]   and live the rest of your life, as Paul said,
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:36.080]   in light of the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:40.240]   everything become rubbish that I may know him
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:41.440]   even in his suffering.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.160]   Let's pray.
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:55.000]   Father, I pray, Father God,
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.560]   that those who have hardened their heart toward you,
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:00.960]   that your word would be the hammer,
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:04.660]   your word would be the fire that causes them,
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:08.600]   causes them to shake off their sins,
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:13.160]   to confess, to know, Father God,
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:16.580]   that the grip Satan has on their hearts and their lives,
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:20.520]   that they would no longer live superficial Christian lives,
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:24.900]   that doesn't look any different than the world,
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:28.760]   that what they have treasured in their heart
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:33.680]   help them to see the futility
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:36.260]   of what many of us pursue,
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.400]   that we may know this life,
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:43.420]   we may know the eternity,
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:47.480]   that we may know, Father God, that we don't belong here,
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:49.840]   that we're just passing through.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.540]   Help us to number our days,
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:55.600]   that we may long and covet the coming of Christ
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.800]   more than any other temptation in this world.
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:04.480]   Lord, we repent that we may see the glory of who Christ is,
[01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:10.580]   that we may follow him, obey him,
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:14.260]   and worship him in spirit and in truth, amen.
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:18.000]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.880]   (gentle piano music)
