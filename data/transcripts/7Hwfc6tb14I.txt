[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.020]   and to just take a few minutes to pray
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.220]   for that upcoming Christmas service,
[00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.100]   and also people that we're trying to invite,
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.620]   you know, who may not know the Lord.
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.980]   And I think it'll be a great opportunity for us
[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.380]   to come together as a church,
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:33.580]   and to really cry out with one heart and one voice,
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.620]   especially for those who don't know Christ.
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.700]   So during this Christmas season,
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.900]   let's go out and just really share this true gospel
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.180]   and Christmas message during this holiday season.
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.460]   Okay, thank you very much.
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.500]   - Thank you.

[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.340]   Just as a reminder, if you want to submit a physical check,
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:01.180]   the box is at the center, backside of the sanctuary,
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.080]   or you can continue to do so online.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.480]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.620]   Our God, we want to thank you
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.860]   for your incredible grace to us.
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:14.860]   Lord, as we think about the season of both Thanksgiving,
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.220]   Lord, what can we say?
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.500]   God, from your own pre-planned,
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.820]   purposeful, intentional heart,
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:26.500]   you desired to minister to those who had no hope,
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.940]   completely lost, Lord, and subject to condemnation.
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.260]   We thank you so much, God,
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.780]   for your mercies that flow every day.
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.820]   We thank you, God, for your overwhelming love,
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.340]   and we pray, Lord, God, that we would completely
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.140]   respond to you with surrender, with love and adoration.
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.820]   And so as we join our hearts now in worship,
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.900]   as we lift up songs to you,
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.980]   may we do so with thanksgiving in our heart
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.420]   and praise of your name.
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.980]   Also, Lord, as we give our offering,
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.540]   we pray that you would be blessed, God,
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.940]   from our desire to be sacrificial
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.700]   for you have given us so much.
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.700]   We pray, Father God, that all that is given
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.180]   would be used for the furtherance of your kingdom
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.780]   and used according to your will.
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.380]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ, and we pray, amen.

[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.100]   Would you please take your Bibles
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.420]   and turn over to Psalm chapter 77.
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:28.860]   We're gonna be reading from verse one through 15,
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.500]   and that's just the introductory verse
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.820]   I wanted to use to guide our thought
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.020]   into the passage that we have ultimately in Matthew.
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.580]   So I'm gonna be preaching from out of Matthew,
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:45.580]   but as an introduction, just turn over to Psalm 77.
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:49.300]   And as you turn there, I want us to think about this idea.
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.300]   You and I live in an absolutely fallen world, right?
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:57.420]   And right now, I mean,
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:01.500]   maybe there are people, politicians,
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.380]   all around, whether on either side of the aisle,
[00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:07.500]   will promise you greater peace, greater prosperity,
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.220]   and a yes we can mentality
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.860]   that we're going to be really, really good.
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.660]   But I read about the end in the Bible
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.300]   and that's not really the case.
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.660]   So I feel a suspicion,
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:20.380]   you're trying to pull a fast one on me, right?
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:24.080]   Scripture says not only are we living in a fallen world,
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.000]   it's going to get worse actually.
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.580]   And what Jesus said was,
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.660]   you are essentially going to suffer in this age.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:32.860]   Something's gonna be constant,
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:35.740]   which is going to be the suffering of the people.
[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.700]   Not only that, I myself, I'm a sinner.
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:43.700]   And given that fact, I hurt myself in different ways, right?
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.500]   I inflict upon all kinds of different woes and pains
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.660]   upon myself because of the fact that I'm a sinner.
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.220]   And then I'm surrounded by sinners.
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.740]   I'm not pointing at you, I'm just saying like we live,
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.580]   and when we say a fallen generation,
[00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:01.020]   everybody can have the potential to disappoint us,
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:03.660]   as a matter of fact, to hurt us very deeply.
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:07.020]   And so we're gonna have sentiments
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.400]   of disappointment and great pain
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.580]   and the reaction to suffering that is expressed here
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:13.620]   in Psalm 77.
[00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.220]   So follow with me as I read.
[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:20.100]   It says, "My voice rises to God and I will cry out.
[00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:23.300]   "My voice rises to God, he'll hear me.
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.060]   "In the day of my trouble, I sought the Lord.
[00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:29.380]   "In the night, my hand stretched out with weariness.
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:32.160]   "My soul refused to be comforted.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.740]   "When I remember God, then I am disturbed.
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:37.020]   "When I sigh, then my spirit grows faint."
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:38.460]   Salaam.
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.980]   "You have held my eyelids open.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.880]   "I am so troubled I cannot speak.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.420]   "I have considered the days of old, the years of long ago.
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:48.040]   "I remember my song in the night.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.980]   "I will meditate with my heart and my spirit ponders.
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.640]   "Will the Lord reject forever?
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:57.980]   "Will he never be favorable again?
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.680]   "Has his loving kindness ceased forever?
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.420]   "Has his promise come to an end forever?
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.180]   "Has God forgotten to be gracious?
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:09.100]   "Or has he in anger withdrawn his compassion?"
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.000]   Salaam.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.100]   That means to stop and think.
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:15.100]   Those are some really expressive words
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.300]   of the sentiment that within the midst of suffering,
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:23.300]   your feeling is God probably either forgot about me
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.020]   or he withdrew his grace.
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.900]   That's a sentiment.
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.260]   And then it changes to verse 10.
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.260]   "Then I said, 'It is actually my grief
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:35.100]   "'that the right hand of the Most High has changed.
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.080]   "'I shall remember the deeds of the Lord.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.080]   "'Surely I will remember your wonders of old.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.740]   "'I will meditate on all your work and muse on your deeds.
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.360]   "'Your way, O God, is holy.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.360]   "'What God is great like our God?
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.740]   "'You are the God who works wonders.
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.440]   "'You have made known your strength among the peoples.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.560]   "'You have by your power redeemed your people,
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.900]   "'the sons of Jacob and Joseph.'"
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:58.740]   Salaam.
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:03.360]   The fact of the matter is, A, you're going to experience
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.700]   incredible amounts of suffering,
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.400]   and even those of you who've experienced
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.940]   incredible amount of blessing in your life
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:11.040]   where perhaps you've never had to deal with
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.760]   physical ailment, sickness in the family,
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.920]   or even things like being poor and not having enough.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:22.080]   Even then, many people will testify to the fact
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.800]   that the blessing of the Lord becomes painful to you.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.560]   Let me say that again.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.960]   The blessings of the earth, not the Lord.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.320]   Earthly blessings.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.560]   Having lots of money.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.300]   Burdensome.
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.320]   Having lots of popularity.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.260]   Burdensome.
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:42.200]   Things in the world, it just tends to
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.040]   disappoint.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.660]   It tends to hurt in some odd way.
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:50.680]   So that's one side.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:52.880]   But here and now, the passage is saying,
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.640]   the author is saying, "But I am going to make sure
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.800]   "that I don't lean on my experience."
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.360]   Oh, look at my extensive experience.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.400]   I am hopeless, those people are hopeless,
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.400]   everything is going to be as it is,
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.720]   everything is for naught.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.480]   No, he says, "What I'm going to do in this midst
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.720]   "of the suffering is going to look
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.240]   "on the long history of God's great work."
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:20.640]   And so Christians, one of the practices we regularly have
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.640]   is we look back, right?
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:26.280]   We look back on the incredible works of God.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.960]   Incredible works of God in drawing the nation of Egypt out,
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.360]   the great exodus.
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:35.360]   Incredible miracles of God to protect and to preserve.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.680]   Incredible works of God to win battles,
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.500]   to raise nations, to destroy nations,
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.320]   to deliver and redeem.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.600]   Incredible works of Jesus to heal,
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.600]   to even raise from the dead.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:52.760]   Does that mean history was sanitized
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.360]   of all suffering and pain?
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.440]   No, mankind's history has still been riddled
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.280]   with all sorts of pain and suffering.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.240]   But what we're talking about is this,
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:02.840]   it's an issue of faith.
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:07.900]   It's an issue of faith to not use just my experiences,
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:11.320]   just my eyes, and to doubt whether God is there or not,
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.280]   but to believe with our hearts
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:17.000]   that God is still nevertheless absolutely powerful
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.900]   and that he is absolutely present with that power.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:27.360]   You see, I think many of us have the temptation
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:31.760]   to wonder and look at our lives and to conclude
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.360]   either God must not care
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.920]   or God must not be powerful enough.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.160]   Today, we're gonna be looking at a specific example
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:42.600]   in the life of Christ,
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.840]   in a life in the history of mankind,
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.880]   where Christ has proven to be both.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:52.020]   To be so compassionate,
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.420]   to be there in the immediate presence
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:57.420]   of the most pressing needs of mankind,
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.260]   but also to exhibit incredible power,
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.900]   proving himself to be worthy of all praise.
[00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:05.800]   So let's take a moment now to turn to Matthew chapter eight.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.260]   Okay, Matthew chapter eight.
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:12.100]   And in Matthew chapter eight verses one and down,
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.060]   what happens is Jesus,
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:16.100]   he just had a mass of people follow him,
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:18.540]   hearing his great authoritative preaching,
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.760]   famously called the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.740]   As he's coming down from the mountain,
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:24.720]   various people approach him,
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:29.720]   a leper, a centurion gentile, Peter's mother-in-law,
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.840]   and Jesus miraculously heals them.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.360]   Boom, boom, boom.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:35.740]   Let's take a moment to start reading here
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:38.980]   in Matthew chapter eight, verses one through four.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:40.820]   When Jesus came down from the mountain,
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:42.620]   large crowds followed him,
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:45.220]   and a leper came to him and bowed down before him
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:48.300]   and said, "Lord, if you are willing,
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.500]   "you can make me clean."
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.980]   Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him,
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:56.420]   saying, "I am willing, be cleansed."
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.080]   And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:00.380]   And Jesus said to him,
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.440]   "See that you tell nobody,
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.780]   "but go, show yourself to the priest
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:08.300]   "and present the offering that Moses commanded
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.260]   "as a testimony to them."
[00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:11.660]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:17.380]   Our Heavenly Father, we thank you, God.
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.620]   We know that you are powerful.
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:20.940]   You are the creator of the world.
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:25.080]   We know, Father God, that perhaps recreating a limb,
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.620]   perhaps making a man whole again,
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:29.980]   those are nothing for you.
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:32.800]   But we also thank you, God,
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.440]   that that power you exhibit, you say,
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.960]   the power that you exhibit in Christ,
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.120]   you exhibit towards us in our salvation,
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.320]   God, in the redemption of our souls,
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:46.360]   in the healing, Father God, for us for eternity.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.720]   And so, Lord, we thank you.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.960]   Right now, as we look upon your word,
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.080]   I pray that, God, through your spirit,
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.240]   your word would work mightily within our minds
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.080]   and within our hearts.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.280]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.420]   Okay.
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:02.160]   So, we read that short four verses,
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.520]   and as I was studying the passage,
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.360]   I just, at one moment, just prayed,
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:08.620]   like, God, I wish you would've wrote more.
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.580]   This is an incredible story.
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:15.120]   We believe Jesus, with a touch and word,
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.320]   made a man who was so sickly,
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:23.840]   disease-infested, instantaneously clean.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.480]   We believe that.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.520]   We believe in the power of Christ, amen?
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:31.420]   The world will be like, okay, right?
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:36.860]   Sure, what else does he have to help me in my life, right?
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.500]   But what we're doing is camping down
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:42.540]   and realizing Christ exhibited such power
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:46.460]   that all he had to do was, again, in one short phrase,
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:47.820]   he touched him and he healed him.
[00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:48.940]   That was it.
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.900]   But what we're gonna learn from this whole scenario
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:54.780]   is to look at the faith of the leper
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:57.460]   who believed in that power, right?
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.400]   We're going to dissect and see the leper who came,
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.520]   approached Jesus, requested and asked
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.760]   and humbled himself before the Lord,
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.700]   what is contained in his mind and his heart
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.400]   that he would come to the Lord in this fashion?
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.040]   That's the question.
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:15.880]   What faith of the man who is the leper?
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:18.480]   Now, we've been doing this study in the book of Hebrews
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.560]   talking about great faith,
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:23.800]   and we said that this faith that the people had,
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.080]   it wasn't just an intellectual assent,
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:29.100]   it was substantive, right?
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:30.820]   It was substantive.
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.460]   The things that are unseen,
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:35.860]   exhibited in the faith of those godly individuals.
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:38.860]   And today, it's just kind of a mini version of that
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:41.620]   in the individual here in Matthew chapter eight.
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:44.580]   The very first point I have for you then is this.
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:48.040]   This leper clearly believed the power of Christ
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:52.180]   and therefore risked great public shame, okay?
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.100]   He clearly believed in the power of Christ
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.440]   and that's why he risked great public shame.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:00.640]   The passage just simply starts with such a mundane way
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.840]   of saying the leper came and he bowed before him, right?
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.240]   But in the other corollary passages,
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.280]   this story is recorded in both the gospel of Mark
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.800]   and Luke as well.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.640]   In the gospel of Luke, the author describes it and says,
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:18.640]   behold, there was a man covered in leprosy.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.600]   A little bit more descriptive.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.480]   But you notice how there is that kind of almost,
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.860]   superfluous way of saying, behold, right?
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:28.200]   Getting your attention and rightly so.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.800]   Why?
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:34.240]   Because a leper would never come into the crowd.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:38.000]   You see, back in the old day,
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   the leper had no authority, had no right
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.440]   and actually a legal prohibition
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.800]   for him to enter into the crowd.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.000]   When we study this passage,
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.640]   I hope you can do the whole mental picture with me.
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.520]   We said earlier that Jesus was teaching on the mountain
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:56.360]   and there was a crowd.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:57.480]   How big was that crowd?
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.880]   What it says earlier, prior to Matthew chapter five,
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.800]   when the story begins of his discourse,
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:08.000]   is that people from regions all around came to him.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.480]   So when we see a crowd like this for us,
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.100]   having a group this size is already big.
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:14.320]   This is about 100 people in the room.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.800]   Before pandemic, this room held 400 people.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.320]   That was big.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.200]   I mean, at that point, you couldn't even know the names
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.160]   of the people in the room.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.760]   But when you think about scenarios like that,
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.400]   that was a hundred fold more than that.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.880]   It was not uncommon for Jesus to feed,
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.280]   remember the 5,000.
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:33.880]   It was not uncommon for Jesus to teach in masses
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:37.200]   well over 5,000 people, including if there were male,
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:39.280]   female and even children.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:41.520]   So you're talking about a massive group of people.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.800]   And remember, there was such a stir.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.240]   This could be the Messiah.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:50.480]   We're talking about a huge group of people.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.420]   So picture that, a massive group of people moving together,
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:56.920]   following Jesus as he's coming down the mountain
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.120]   and the leper comes.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:01.520]   I mean, I'm gonna right now try to describe to you
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.400]   what the leper is, but right now we're in the middle
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:04.600]   of COVID.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.440]   Imagine back in March, when you started hearing
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:10.880]   of there was a disease that was spreading in China,
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.920]   in Wuhan, and people were dropping.
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.760]   There were stories and rumors of people having fever,
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.880]   coughs, right?
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.200]   Can you imagine being the individual?
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:26.160]   I'm from Wuhan, I have a severe fever, right?
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.440]   I have some symptoms of heavy coughing, heavy breathing.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.480]   You couldn't force people to come near you.
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.240]   People would just run, okay?
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.080]   In many ways, that's how it was.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:41.520]   For a leper, a leper was an individual so distinctly
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.760]   riddled with disease.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:48.080]   The passage says he was covered in leprosy.
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:51.800]   If you don't know, the leprosy, the term itself,
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:55.000]   both in the Hebrew and the Greek means scaly.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:55.920]   Why?
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.800]   Because this disease attacked the flesh.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.720]   People would have ulcers, boils, and sores.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.240]   It would be discolored.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:06.520]   Your skin on the face would look scaly
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.080]   like it was that of a reptile almost.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:14.360]   I looked it up on Google and then regretted it, right?
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.120]   I was tempted to show you.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:17.480]   I'm gonna leave it to you.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:19.320]   Go look it up sometime.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:23.120]   The thing about it is, yes, I just,
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:26.040]   I'm thinking about it in terms of the devastation,
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.840]   but right now it's not common, you don't see it.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:31.800]   But it is present in some of the more rural areas
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.280]   in certain countries, in the Philippines, there are cases.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.960]   In India, there are cases.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.480]   Right now the cases are a lot lower,
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.120]   but it's still going on.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.160]   And the thing about it is in those scenarios,
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.080]   it is so difficult to treat
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.880]   'cause this disease affects every part of you.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.240]   Let me go on.
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.640]   This disease not only affects the skin,
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:55.840]   it attacks the nervous system so that you cannot feel.
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.040]   And this disease was called the disease
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.560]   that mimics everything.
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:00.720]   Why?
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.960]   Because it's not so much that it had this kind of infection
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.880]   and bacteria like everything else,
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.320]   but what it is is if you get a cut,
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:11.480]   can you imagine getting a cut and not being able to feel it?
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.560]   You would get infections
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.480]   because you wouldn't be able to treat it.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:16.360]   Can you imagine not being able to feel?
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.440]   If you're using a tool
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.920]   and that tool is ripping into your skin,
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.720]   not being able to feel it?
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.040]   If you had certain pains, not being able to feel it?
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.840]   And so people would literally rub away
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:29.840]   certain parts of their skin because they couldn't feel it.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:32.600]   It attacked the nervous system and the tendons
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:36.240]   so that your fingers and your extremities would be drawn in
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:40.000]   and people would have essentially claw-like hands.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.840]   It would attack your bones and it become brittle
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:45.720]   and individuals would lose pieces of their, again,
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:49.320]   their fingers and their toes.
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.800]   There's a lot of picture of people
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.920]   who have lost their noses, their ears.
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:55.560]   This would also attack the eyes
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:58.360]   and so many individuals after years would die of,
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:00.000]   I mean, sorry, would go blind.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.800]   It would attack the vocal cords.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:02.640]   And so a long time ago,
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:05.320]   there was this movie with Charlton Heston
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.920]   on Ten Commandments or even Ben-Hur.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.720]   And within those movies, there are people with leprosy
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:13.240]   and they would always have this incredibly raspy voice.
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.800]   That was because the disease
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.720]   would ravish their vocal cords.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.720]   Why am I describing all of this to you?
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.160]   Because when the passage says,
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:26.160]   "Behold, there was a man covered in leprosy,"
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.640]   this individual was distinctly, apparently,
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:33.640]   obviously, to the naked eye, diseased.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:36.080]   And to go beyond that,
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:39.680]   lepers were given these clothes that they would wear
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.760]   and they would have to yell out, "Unclean, unclean!"
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:47.760]   Did you know that the law within both tradition
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.840]   required a certain amount of distance
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.720]   between an individual and a leper?
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.600]   A leper had to keep that distance.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.400]   And what's interesting, over tradition and time,
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:59.360]   they said a leper had to keep minimum six feet distance.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.800]   So 1.2 meters, right?
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:05.000]   They had to, they had to keep that distance.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.320]   And so what I'm saying is,
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:10.360]   you don't even almost have to say, "Behold,"
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.600]   because in a massive crowd,
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.680]   to say that this man was a sticking out sore thumb
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.080]   would be an understatement.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:19.080]   You would imagine then the crowd moving
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.800]   and this individual coming to Jesus,
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.200]   and most likely the crowd would be like,
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.840]   "What are you doing?"
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.240]   Right?
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.440]   I would imagine that certain individuals saying like,
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.200]   "No, there's other people who need to be healed.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.040]   "You stay back over there."
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:34.800]   When I say that this individual,
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:39.600]   because he believed Christ to be powerful enough to help him,
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.600]   he risked it all, he truly did.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.880]   Because not only did he risk the shame of everybody's sake,
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:46.400]   "Look at that leper.
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.680]   "Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:48.840]   "Pulling the kids back."
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:49.680]   Right?
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.520]   You can imagine this.
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:51.360]   "Pulling the kids back.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.200]   "Don't go near him.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.360]   "Cover your mouth."
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:54.320]   Did you know that they believed,
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.200]   and it was proven to be true,
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.040]   that leprosy was transmitted through droplets
[00:49:58.040 --> 00:50:00.640]   from the mouth and from the nose.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.560]   And so they had this thing,
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:03.680]   you had to keep all distance.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:07.080]   This individual risked everything
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:10.040]   because he was in risk of breaking the law.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.160]   This individual risked everything
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.560]   because he was actually in risk of being stoned to death.
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:18.320]   Tradition had it that if you see a leper
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:21.320]   out of his place walking down the street,
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:23.600]   you essentially had an unwritten code,
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:24.600]   you could stone him.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.360]   And sadly to say,
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:29.240]   some of the first people to throw the first stone
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.000]   would be the priests.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.720]   To show that person is unclean.
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.520]   You could see why that by the description
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:38.080]   of what leprosy is,
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.520]   it was used as a depiction of sin.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.680]   That it desensitized you.
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:46.440]   That it killed you outside, inside.
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:47.560]   And biblically speaking,
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:52.120]   it caused you to be ceremonially unclean.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:57.120]   This individual was radically dejected from the society.
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:00.200]   Why do I bring this stuff up?
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:04.840]   It's because all of this was obvious to everybody.
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:09.880]   But it required the faith that Christ could do something
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:10.960]   for him to come out.
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:17.200]   For him to not try to some in meager way to save face.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.720]   Let me quickly turn it to us.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:22.520]   Sometimes our perpetual desire to save face
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:25.600]   prevents us from experiencing the power of God.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:30.080]   Our feeble attempts to somehow self-preserve
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:33.400]   prevents us from going to the Lord to draw near.
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:36.840]   You know Christ has come.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.520]   You know he's drawn near.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:41.040]   You know that he desires for all to come to him.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:45.120]   But if this leper wallowed in the,
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:47.920]   I am rejected by society, I know I am unclean,
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.680]   I know I am filthy, I know I am diseased,
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:54.440]   then he would have just stayed in his camp.
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.040]   But my guess is if you picture the scene,
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.440]   maybe he was hiding out on the side of the crowds,
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.880]   maybe he was hiding behind a structure or a bush,
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.920]   I am guessing he heard the authoritative preaching of Jesus
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:09.640]   and said that man has power.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:11.640]   He believed it.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:16.800]   That would be the only rational line and reason
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:20.280]   for him to go and risk all of that,
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:24.320]   potentially being stoned by even the religious leaders.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.800]   Now moving forward then to number two,
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.880]   the leper believed in the power of Christ
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.120]   and therefore humbled himself to worship.
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:36.320]   He believed, he must have believed in the power of Christ
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.520]   because look at the way he worshiped.
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.240]   It says that the leper came
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:44.720]   and he bowed himself down before Jesus.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:48.560]   That word for bow down is proskuneo.
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:52.120]   As you guys know, Greek, very just extensive language,
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:53.480]   has multiple terms.
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.640]   There's lots of terms for worship, adoration, and praise,
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:59.120]   but this specific term, if you've heard it before,
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.600]   proskuneo means to prostrate oneself,
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.240]   which means to bring low.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.040]   So Mark chapter one, verse 40,
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.640]   it says that he fell on his knees.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:12.120]   Luke chapter five, it says he fell to his face.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.080]   The common practice of the day
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:17.160]   was that when you find somebody who is superior to you,
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.640]   you would come and then you would lower yourself
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.840]   and put your forehead to the ground.
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:23.840]   It is an act of saying,
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:27.240]   I am unworthy to look at you in this fashion.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.640]   This was an act of worship.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.920]   Proskuneo was used predominantly
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.040]   as a means to show adoration.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.760]   The way that it's used commonly
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.440]   is to actually like interpret it in another,
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.320]   I guess, translate it in other works of literature
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:43.920]   is to send a kiss, not a romance, okay?
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:48.600]   It's not blowing a kiss, but like a kiss of homage.
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.320]   If I can paint a picture for you,
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:51.640]   sort of movie analogy.
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:56.160]   Have you guys seen those Italian mobster movies?
[00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.760]   You know what happens?
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:59.240]   It's the Don, right?
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:00.920]   Don Corleone.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.800]   He comes and all he does is extend his hand.
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.560]   What do the people do?
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:07.520]   You've got grown men who lean down and, you know?
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:10.240]   Have you guys ever done that to somebody?
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:12.480]   (laughs)
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.520]   If you've ever done that to anybody,
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:16.400]   that person receiving it would probably be like,
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.240]   what are you doing?
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:18.600]   You mocking me?
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:19.800]   Because it's so outlandish.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:23.680]   It's so expressive in its show of homage.
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:26.920]   Back then when there was such hierarchy, people did that.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.240]   But imagine this.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:30.000]   It's not even a bow to kiss the hand.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.360]   Now it's, I'm gonna go all the way down,
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.560]   falling on his face.
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:38.560]   What am I talking about here?
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:41.520]   Look at the leper's faith.
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:43.520]   He recognizes his inferiority.
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.760]   He recognizes Jesus' superiority
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:49.680]   and he goes down to the floor, right?
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:51.800]   Contrast that.
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:55.880]   Contrast that with what the common day thought
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.160]   was about Jesus.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:00.480]   At this time, early on in the ministry,
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.280]   there was so much conjecture about who Jesus was.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:05.480]   Later on even, even later on into the story
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:08.520]   of Jesus' ministry, Jesus asked the disciples directly,
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:09.600]   who do you say I am?
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.400]   Do you guys remember what they said?
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.280]   Well, some say you're Elijah.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.880]   Some say you're Jeremiah.
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:18.360]   Some say you gotta be one of them prophets, right?
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.240]   People were not sure, but this leper got it.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:28.000]   You're clearly one cent of God,
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.240]   powerful enough to meet my need.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.560]   Yes?
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:35.760]   When we're talking about this specific scenario,
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:40.760]   what you see is a man convinced this man deserves worship
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:44.720]   because in this culture, if the individual was a Jew,
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:48.080]   you dare not worship any man, right?
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.960]   And amongst the Jewish culture,
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:52.960]   if you were receiving worship, you would be like,
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:56.680]   no, no, no, no, no, don't do that 'cause I'm just a man.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:58.520]   And if you tried to give worship to something
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:01.120]   that was not God, you would be like,
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:03.440]   blasphemy, stone him.
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:08.440]   What this man is doing is recognizing the power of Christ.
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.160]   And so he goes down to worship.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:15.360]   For every single one of us, what a challenge.
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:20.360]   The faith of the leper to recognize the power of Christ
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:23.280]   and to humble himself in worship.
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:25.720]   Spurgeon says it in an intense way.
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:28.960]   Those who call on Jesus but do not worship him
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.960]   are more diseased than this leper.
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:34.080]   In his commentary, he says,
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:36.360]   if you're so blind and you can't see Jesus,
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.920]   you are blinder than the leper.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:40.640]   If you cannot give worship,
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:43.000]   you must have not seen the light of Christ,
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.720]   is what he's saying.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:46.680]   I wanna address this a little bit.
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:51.680]   We here at Berean, we focus in on the sufficiency,
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:55.820]   the authority and the power of the word of God,
[00:56:55.820 --> 00:57:00.520]   which is appropriate and true to what the word proclaims.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:05.440]   So rightly so, we must be people of the word.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.760]   That's good.
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:10.360]   The danger for people who are focused on the Bible
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:14.400]   is to make their spiritual experience one of intellect.
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.240]   And so sometimes I hear people talking
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.680]   about their Christian faith from before
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:20.600]   in terms of God's work in their life
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:23.160]   and in terms of currently how they are growing,
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:25.040]   all in terms of intellect.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:27.120]   You know, I became Christian earlier on.
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.840]   My parents taught me the gospel and taught me the Bible.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:32.320]   And then there were some times when I studied it.
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.280]   And then at a certain point,
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:36.080]   I started taking it more seriously and studying it more.
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:37.960]   And then I got it.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:39.520]   Started clicking.
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:42.200]   Now, some of us talk like that, and that's okay.
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:43.880]   I'm not saying you can't talk like that,
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:45.760]   because I understand what you're saying.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.760]   You learn progressively the truths of God.
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:49.320]   It convicted you, and at a certain point,
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:52.600]   it started hitting you more, and it started to make sense,
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:55.040]   and you understood.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:55.880]   Good.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:58:01.120]   But if you stop there, there's something missing
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.680]   that is shown in this passage.
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:05.600]   Because if you ask the leper,
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:10.720]   if you ask the leper, "Did you get it?"
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:14.840]   He's gonna say, "I saw Christ, and I surrendered."
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.520]   There is a huge difference when saying,
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:19.400]   "You know, at a certain point in my Christian walk,
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:21.560]   "it started clicking, I understood."
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:25.720]   Versus, "You know, I saw Jesus, and I prostrated myself.
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:30.760]   "I put myself at his mercy because he is God."
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:33.200]   And there's an experiential part of Christianity
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:36.640]   where you come before the Lord, and you do this.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:41.200]   "Lord, I fall on my knees because you're God.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:44.360]   "I don't just get you."
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:45.800]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:47.440]   It doesn't just simply click.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:50.480]   I have surrendered to you.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:54.600]   This man expressed, this is like,
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:57.120]   if you're talking about a movie scene,
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:00.480]   some dramatic scene where there's a whole crowd watching,
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:03.080]   this is one incredible scene.
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:05.680]   How expressive, I'm guessing, I'm just assuming,
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:06.920]   reading between the lines here,
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:09.400]   that certain people are like, "What is this fool doing?
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.520]   "Get away."
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:11.440]   Right?
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:15.000]   "We're trying to listen to his teaching, get away from us."
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.080]   And he bows before the Lord and says,
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:21.360]   "Lord, it only, it only record, I wish it recorded more.
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:23.560]   "It only records one phrase,
[00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:26.960]   "but I'm pretty sure this leopard said more.
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:32.240]   "Lord, you have power, you have authority."
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.720]   Right?
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:36.120]   And in that way, I challenge every single one of us
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:42.120]   that our faith is a reactionary worship
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:45.160]   to seeing the great light of Christ.
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:47.920]   And clearly what we learn from this leopard
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:50.800]   is he saw the power of Jesus.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:53.560]   Let's move on to the next point, which is,
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:55.680]   the leopard believed the power of Christ
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:57.240]   and he asked for cleansing.
[00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:01.680]   Okay, this leopard believed upon the power of Christ
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.200]   and he asked for cleansing.
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.440]   Scripture again in Matthew says,
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.040]   "When he came down from the mountain,
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.560]   "a large crowds," sorry, "large crowds followed him
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:13.040]   "and a leopard came to him and bowed down before him
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.760]   "and said, 'Lord, if you are willing,
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.200]   "'you can make me clean.'"
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.600]   Now, in this passage, it's not even a question,
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.720]   it's just a statement.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:24.120]   "I believe you are so powerful, it's not even an issue.
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:27.880]   "The only question is, will you?"
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:28.720]   Do you see that?
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.560]   He's not asking, "Can you?"
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:34.040]   You know, like, "What did you do with me?
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.160]   "Why, how come?"
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.640]   And then think about this,
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.760]   back then families were typically pretty big.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.280]   I'm assuming this individual perhaps had family
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.080]   who could not touch him or see him.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.560]   Why is it that my brother is clean and I am not?
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:49.480]   It perhaps is a very plausible scenario.
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:53.040]   But rather than asking those questions,
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:57.800]   he is asking the question, "Lord, are you willing?"
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.200]   Now, the reason why I said it's a question
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.240]   is because the other passages, Luke chapter five, verse 14,
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:06.080]   talks about how he implored the Lord Jesus.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.680]   So he is begging and he asks.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.160]   And he's saying, "God," he's saying to the Lord,
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:15.720]   "Christ, Jesus, I believe in your power.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:19.560]   "And only if you're willing, I know I will be clean."
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.120]   And it's just like the centurion's faith.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.640]   The centurion said, "You don't even have to come to my house.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:29.080]   "Just say the word and my servant will be clean."
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.520]   That's faith, that's absolute faith.
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.760]   But as I meditated upon this passage,
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.440]   please meditate with me.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.520]   I didn't wanna make too much of this,
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.560]   and he asked or he said the statement,
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.880]   and I'm making a big deal about it,
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:45.920]   but let's take a moment to meditate.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:51.760]   This individual asked something that was obvious.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:55.960]   He was covered in leprosy.
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.840]   He was clearly deformed in some way or another.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:02.840]   Did he have to ask?
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.200]   And as soon as I started thinking that,
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.840]   I felt a conviction in my heart.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:10.200]   'Cause there's something stubborn in me
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:13.560]   that doesn't want to ask, right?
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.640]   There's something weird about asking
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.160]   that makes you feel a little bit less.
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:24.160]   So you turn to other things to get what you need or want.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.080]   Let me give you an example.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:29.160]   Now, we have perhaps all dealt with an individual
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.680]   who you know they want something,
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.640]   but they're all manipulative.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.840]   So they use things like complaining,
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.440]   throwing a tantrum, crossing their arms
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:40.040]   and giving you cold shoulder, like fine then.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.480]   Don't want it either, right?
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.200]   And they'll maybe even complain.
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.320]   Like, "You did it for them, what about me?"
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.960]   And now it's always question of like,
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:50.200]   "Are you being fair or not?"
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.160]   And then you're just kind of thinking,
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.600]   "Just ask me."
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.920]   You have perhaps seen other people
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.360]   where they offer up better plans.
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.240]   They give you advice, but then you recognize
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.800]   like you have conflict of interest.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:06.320]   All your plans result in you getting what you want.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.680]   I want you to recognize
[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.480]   that many people have done that to Christ.
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.240]   "Jesus, why don't you, you know what?
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.320]   Why don't you make, be king?
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.280]   We'll make you king."
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.560]   And then what that does is we want you to be king
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.520]   because then we usher in the revolution of the Jews, right?
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.560]   Like, it's so self-interested.
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:27.160]   We do that.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.760]   And the reason why I say this is because I do that.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:34.640]   You, there are certain things you feel that you need,
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:35.920]   you're deficient.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:39.080]   Maybe you feel pain, you feel suffering.
[01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:40.960]   And rather than asking the Lord,
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.800]   maybe you're fighting your sin.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.560]   Maybe you're whatever it may be.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.880]   There is this weird categorical pride in me
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.720]   that doesn't want to ask.
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.400]   And then even in marriage relationships,
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.240]   quick dating tip,
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:58.520]   'cause you guys know I love to give those, right?
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:02.000]   Sometimes you play a game in romantic relationships
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.280]   where you're not too direct with asking stuff.
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.400]   Because it's weird if you, in a dating relationship,
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:10.720]   it's like, "I want to ask you, will you love me?
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.640]   Will you take care of me?
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.280]   Will you be all affectionate?
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.760]   Hug me."
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:16.600]   And then all of a sudden
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.200]   you look like this really needy person, okay?
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.880]   But the reason why I bring that up
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:24.880]   is because there's this little phrase
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.960]   that I've often caused relationships to go sour.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.880]   "I don't want to have to ask you
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:35.720]   to care for me and consider me.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:40.040]   And if you go, right, to the fridge to get a cold drink,
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:43.360]   do I have to ask you every time, can you get me one too?
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.920]   Why can't you just think of me and bring me one?"
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:46.920]   Okay?
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.120]   You guys have never said that?
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.840]   (laughs)
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:53.200]   A lot of times in relationships, they do that to each other.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.160]   I don't want to have to ask you
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.120]   for affection and consideration.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.440]   I don't have to beg you for stuff.
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:00.280]   You should know.
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:04.920]   And then you realize, there it is.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:07.520]   I have a problem asking for stuff
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:09.880]   because when it's super obvious, and again,
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.960]   he had to ask for the obvious.
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:17.560]   Everybody could see what his problem is,
[01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.320]   but he humbled himself to ask,
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:23.160]   "Lord, would you make me clean?"
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:28.720]   Within that question, there is a willingness
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:33.280]   to place oneself at the mercy of his will.
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:38.520]   And that's when it hurts our pride in human relationships.
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:42.000]   It places me somehow at your mercy.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.880]   And I want to challenge every single one of you.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.840]   Yes, from human to human,
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:48.720]   you don't want to act like that needy person
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.600]   who's always asking for everything.
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:51.440]   Why?
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:53.880]   Because scripture says in many different scenarios,
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.160]   "Bear your own burden, so long as it determines on you.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.520]   Don't owe people anything."
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.360]   Right?
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.360]   Don't be a burden.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:01.440]   Don't be a free bird.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:05.960]   But between you and our God,
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:08.520]   between you and Christ,
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:12.840]   the reality is you need everything from his merciful hand.
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:17.720]   The reality is, the situation is,
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:21.040]   he is of power, you are of need.
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.600]   That's the reality.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:28.320]   By faith, we should be very comfortable
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:29.440]   humbling ourselves and saying,
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:33.400]   "God, you have the power to meet my need."
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.720]   And scripture says,
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.880]   "These are the people who will be blessed."
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:41.760]   In Isaiah chapter 40, verse 31,
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.200]   "Yet those who wait for the Lord
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.120]   will gain new strength.
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:48.480]   They will mount up with wings like eagles.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:50.480]   They will run and not get tired,
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.320]   and they will walk and not become weary.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:53.480]   Behold."
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:57.960]   Oh, sorry, I'm gonna read another passage, Psalm 123.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:01.480]   "Behold, as the eyes of servants
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:04.160]   look to the hand of their master,
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.680]   as the eyes of a maid to the hand of their mistress,
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.080]   so our eyes look to the Lord our God
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:13.320]   until he is gracious to us."
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:15.520]   You see, the world will see that and say,
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.360]   "What?
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.840]   I'm no servant?
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.440]   I'm no slave?
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:25.840]   I'm no maid to a mistress?
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:28.560]   You want me to ask and sit there
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:30.000]   and wait for him to answer?"
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.760]   And the flesh will rebel in that fashion.
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:37.640]   Biblically speaking, what we're saying
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.640]   is just as obvious as the disease of a man
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.920]   of great leprosy, so is your sin.
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.920]   So is your great need.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.720]   It isn't obvious.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:49.000]   We are covered in sin.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.680]   We are so deeply in sin.
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:56.120]   And it's only us who fool ourselves to try and save face.
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:00.880]   But when we humble ourselves to ask, we will be blessed.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:04.680]   Lastly, then, lastly, like the leper,
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.880]   we must believe that the Lord is willing.
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:10.520]   The leper believed in the power of God,
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:15.760]   but the leper believed that the powerful Lord is willing.
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:19.080]   Let me read to you what it says.
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:23.040]   Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him,
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:27.440]   saying, "I am willing."
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:30.920]   He cleansed, and immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:34.760]   I wish I could have been there.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.480]   I mean, if there is an incredible, dramatic scene,
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:42.320]   something just epic, you have thousands of people watching.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:46.480]   You'd probably have a commotion like, "Gasp!
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:48.000]   "Jesus touched him!"
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.520]   Right?
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.360]   That's forbidden!
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:52.560]   "Gasp!
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:53.680]   "Jesus is unclean!
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:55.920]   "Gasp!
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.520]   "Doesn't he know?"
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.720]   This is an epic moment.
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:04.200]   But what they see is not Jesus being contaminated.
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.360]   They see the man he cleansed.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:12.360]   And to us, those words, "I am willing," that's incredible.
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:18.520]   And to us, that simple act, Jesus touched him,
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.840]   that's beautiful.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:24.120]   The thing about it is Jesus didn't need to touch him.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:28.200]   The very next story is, "I don't even need to go there.
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.360]   "I just say the word, and it is so."
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:32.800]   That's how powerful our Lord Jesus is.
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:38.240]   Jesus touching him is a ministering of compassion
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.960]   to the one who is weak and feeble.
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:45.360]   Imagine with me the life of a leper.
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:49.200]   Not even his parents can touch him.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.160]   He's an untouchable, unapproachable.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:56.200]   If there was somebody who was an outcast
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:59.200]   on the outskirts of society, this would be it.
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:02.800]   But Jesus approached and touched him.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:06.680]   I can imagine just the tears in the man's eye,
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:10.080]   just flowing out of thankfulness.
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.360]   As a matter of fact, I could even imagine the man going,
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.360]   "What are you doing?
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.160]   "Don't touch me, Lord!"
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:16.080]   Right?
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.400]   'Cause clearly the man respected him, and he knew himself.
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:24.080]   And I imagine this scene, the leper reeling back like,
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.160]   (gasps)
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.240]   and then Jesus touching him,
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:30.000]   and him feeling cleansed from head to toe.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.600]   That's crazy stuff.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:35.560]   This is the most incredibly beautiful scene.
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:40.360]   And so Jesus addressed every part of it.
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.520]   It was instantaneous.
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:45.640]   He didn't say, "Got medicine, vaccine, take two a day."
[01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:49.240]   It was miraculous, instantaneous,
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:51.200]   in the moment, it was perfect.
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:55.040]   But what's really astounding about this
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:57.360]   is Jesus proceeds to say, "I am willing."
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:01.680]   Brothers and sisters, this is the gospel.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:06.360]   Scripture says that God on his own initiative,
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:09.320]   he purposed before the foundation of the world
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:12.520]   to take sinners lost and condemned like ourselves,
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:17.120]   and to hold and have us, to love us, to redeem us,
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.600]   to adopt us, and to perfect us.
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:23.200]   That was all done, Ephesians chapter one,
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.080]   according to the kind intention of his will.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:30.000]   God had to have done nothing.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.920]   He doesn't have to do anything.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.400]   It doesn't have to be, "Oh, that guy got it.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.680]   "I had no sin, I had no sickness.
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:40.320]   "He has sickness, why is it?"
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.560]   No, he doesn't have to do anything.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.000]   Scripture says in Hebrews chapter two,
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.600]   you see, angels fell, humans fell,
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:56.040]   but God so desired to be of help to the children of Abraham,
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.480]   and when he did, he sent his son.
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:03.160]   Brothers and sisters, if you are going through hard times,
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:05.920]   I began with Psalm chapter 77.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.320]   Lord, have you forgotten me?
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:10.480]   Are you going to reject me forever?
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:13.800]   He says, "You held my eyelids open."
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:17.200]   That means he can't sleep, 'cause it bothers him so.
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:21.440]   I will remember the mighty deeds of God.
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.840]   I wanna ask you, this leper is showing to us
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:29.640]   a model of faith, to believe in the power of Christ, amen?
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:33.200]   Do you have that conviction?
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:36.320]   My Lord is near and he is willing.
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:39.320]   He is compassionate and he is powerful,
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:42.600]   and by the simple word, he healed him.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:45.440]   And after this story, he healed the next
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:46.800]   and the next and the next, and actually,
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:49.040]   Scripture says he healed, as he was teaching,
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:52.120]   he healed many, and to write of it
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.560]   would fill books and books and books.
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:57.640]   This is our Lord.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.080]   Do you believe he is willing?
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.160]   And I wanna say to you guys,
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.600]   that as I was preparing this passage,
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:09.040]   there was an individual where I was counseling
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.520]   and I was afraid to, he had suffered deeply.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.760]   He wasn't like a Job story, but he had suffered
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:18.640]   in a way where I thought, I don't know what to say to you,
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.640]   'cause if I say stuff to you wrong,
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.960]   I might offend you, right?
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:26.080]   I'm not gonna say, hey, look on the bright side.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:27.400]   The guy has suffered to the degree
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:30.840]   where I just was so careful, maybe too careful,
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:34.400]   because it was a part of me that wanted to share with him
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:36.960]   parts of my devotion and say to him,
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.760]   our God is proven powerful,
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:41.480]   because I worry, what if he comes back
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:43.960]   and it's like, well, not with me.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:45.480]   Don't tell me those stories,
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:49.800]   because yeah, maybe God is powerful with them,
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:50.720]   but not with me.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:56.640]   But I wanna remind you, remember, you know,
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:00.360]   Daniel and his friends, Chadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:03.240]   he had this confidence, my God is so powerful,
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:07.320]   he will deliver me from your hand, right, remember that?
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:10.960]   And then the guy said, you're gonna burn in my furnace,
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:13.880]   right, you're gonna die in my oven.
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:18.640]   And they said, God's either gonna draw us out miraculously
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:19.560]   or we're gonna die in there,
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:22.000]   but either way, God will deliver us.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:27.040]   Brothers and sisters, in terms of what God is willing to do,
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:30.520]   God is willing to do far more than give simple help.
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:35.520]   He wants to deliver you, eternally, to give you perfection.
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:38.560]   For what good is it for a man to gain health,
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.280]   but to have a vicious heart,
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:44.400]   to have an eternity of corruption and condemnation?
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.560]   It's worth nothing.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:52.320]   But Christ, he is willing that you would have life
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.520]   and life eternal.
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:57.680]   And in that compassion and in that love,
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:01.000]   he has poured out his life for us, amen?
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.200]   And that to us, we're reminded here,
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:07.640]   that our Lord is willing, we know what he's willing of.
[01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:12.200]   And as humble servants, as those who we know
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:16.920]   we were stricken with sin, we wait eagerly for our Savior.
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:20.320]   I wanna conclude with this interesting thought.
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:24.160]   In Matthew 8, verse four,
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:27.560]   Jesus says something that's a little bit persurprising.
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.000]   And what he says is this,
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.240]   "See to it that you tell no one,
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.400]   but go, show yourself to the priest
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:38.260]   and present the offering that Moses commanded
[01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:40.360]   as a testimony to them."
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.600]   I give you a warning.
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:46.600]   The challenge is, believe on Christ's power.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:49.960]   And when you believe, that faith will cause you to draw near,
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:51.480]   that faith will humble you,
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:53.600]   that faith will cause you to ask
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.040]   and then to receive the blessing of God.
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.120]   But there's a warning.
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:02.480]   You might not see it apparently, but here is the warning.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:06.880]   Jesus commands the man to go and do
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:09.560]   a fulfillment of the law process,
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:12.200]   which is in Leviticus chapter 13 and 14,
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.240]   God had commanded many things
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:16.720]   pertaining to the instruction of a leper.
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:20.840]   Number one, he had to go show himself to a priest
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:24.880]   to affirm, do I really have leprosy?
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.000]   And if you're confirmed,
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.320]   you are to isolate yourself and call yourself unclean.
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.580]   You know what's crazy?
[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:32.360]   That bulk of it was only four verses
[01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.640]   or five verses in Leviticus chapter 13.
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.680]   The rest is all about what do you do
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:39.320]   when the leper is cleansed?
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:40.920]   Weird thing.
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.920]   I tried to think about scriptural passages
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:43.880]   when the leper was cleansed.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.400]   Can you think of any?
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.520]   I thought of one, Naaman.
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:50.800]   Naaman went to the king, Jerurim, I think was his name,
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:53.720]   'cause he heard that there was a prophet healing there.
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.480]   And when Nahum showed up, the king was like,
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:58.200]   I'm not God, I don't give life.
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:59.840]   How am I supposed to do with you?
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.840]   'Cause clearly leprosy meant you're dead.
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:04.400]   There was no solution for that.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.440]   And then after that, I can't think of it.
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:10.080]   And then the fact of the matter is,
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.520]   if you look at Jewish tradition,
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:13.920]   if you were deemed to have leprosy,
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:16.440]   it actually records in Jewish Talmud tradition,
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.640]   they actually read the last rites
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.520]   and kind of the sayings of the old
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:23.080]   upon your death to the person who just got it.
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.040]   So imagine you go sick to the hospital,
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.920]   and then the priest comes in and starts reading
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.200]   your last verses.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:31.960]   But this was just a slow death.
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:33.640]   It was just, the thinking though,
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:35.440]   was you're as good as dead.
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:38.600]   That's almost cruel then, isn't it?
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:39.920]   Like, or weird.
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:42.360]   It's kind of like getting an instruction manual
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.440]   to what to do when you win the lottery.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:47.480]   And you're like, I'm not gonna ever, right?
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:48.720]   What is this trash?
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:52.680]   To the Jewish leaders and Pharisees of the time,
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:54.200]   they should have been shocked.
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:59.160]   For the first time in my life,
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.160]   I'm practicing Leviticus 13, 14.
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:02.160]   What is this?
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:07.400]   The Jewish leaders should have been like, mind blown.
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.600]   That's the Messiah.
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.600]   He has power.
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.600]   He has authority over disease.
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:17.200]   Because you know what the instructions are in Leviticus?
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.440]   When the man comes and he says he's cleansed,
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.520]   the Levitical priests,
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:24.520]   they essentially do disease tracking.
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:25.360]   Where were you?
[01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.280]   Did you really have it?
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.600]   Did you have the sores?
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:28.560]   What kind of sores did you have?
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:29.560]   What were the ailments?
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:30.600]   Were you really cleansed?
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:33.080]   And essentially, they do a check to make sure
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:36.040]   that this was a genuine miracle.
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:37.400]   That was the law.
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:42.240]   And so Jesus says, go show yourself.
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:45.440]   Jesus has done everything possible
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:48.680]   to convince the world that he is of God.
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:51.080]   He is of God.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:54.560]   You know what the sad state of affairs is?
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:55.640]   Matthew chapter 12.
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:58.680]   Do you know what the Pharisees and the leaders conclude?
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:18:59.840]   That must be a demon.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:02.840]   So sad.
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:05.000]   It's frustrating almost.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.040]   Below, and a warning to every single one of us,
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:13.680]   there is a weird temptation for us
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:17.120]   to not trust the power of Christ.
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:22.920]   We run away when we should be running towards him.
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:25.080]   We hide when we should be exposing.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:28.440]   We do so many things that believe
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:31.560]   that other people can help us, other programs.
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:34.760]   It's not just the nation of Israel,
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.760]   and it's not just the Pharisees.
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:39.520]   How many times has God says, trust me and me alone?
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:42.360]   Why do you keep making alliances with them?
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:44.360]   What is Egypt gonna do for you?
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.880]   They have powers, right?
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:49.600]   That's essentially what they're saying.
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:50.840]   So I end with this warning
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:53.520]   because surprisingly, this passage is a warning.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:56.880]   And it's a rebuke to the established culture
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.800]   and the religious leaders of the time.
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:01.880]   What we need to believe is in the power
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:04.960]   and the willing compassion of Christ.
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.360]   You are going to be tempted and lured by the world.
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:08.640]   No, trust me.
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.080]   No, trust yourself.
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:10.920]   No.
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:15.560]   But may we be of those humble like the leper.
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:20.160]   Lord, if you're willing, I'm going to be clean.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.000]   Amen?
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:21.840]   Let's pray.
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:30.080]   Father God, we thank you so much that in your word,
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:33.360]   we have the answer to the question, are you willing?
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:37.360]   Some of us, Father God, we wrestle with sin
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:41.360]   and it amazes us, like you're willing to forgive me
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.720]   after how many times?
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:49.160]   I pray God we would believe that you have power, Lord,
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:52.040]   and that you're willing and compassionate.
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:55.480]   I pray, Father God, for the faith to be humble, Lord,
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:58.480]   that resorting to my own devices,
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:01.120]   resorting to my own power means certain death.
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:06.200]   And Lord, we must be humble enough to come to you and ask.
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:09.080]   I pray, Father God, anybody in this room
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:11.640]   who is struggling through suffering and hard times,
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:15.040]   God, when they recognize that, Lord, your plan for them
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:18.640]   and your will for them is not to simply have ease here
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.920]   because you already told us we'll walk this life
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:24.760]   with great suffering, but God, to have such great hope.
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:29.320]   To have you means we have everything.
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:32.920]   To have you means we have the greatest power of all.
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:34.160]   Lord, we thank you and praise you.
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.960]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:40.240]   Let us all rise as we sing our closing praise.

[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:16.320]   Lord God, we pray for strength this week.
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:19.960]   Lord, I pray that we would not live by sight,
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:23.160]   we would not live according to the wisdom of man,
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.560]   but rather, God, we would live by faith.
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:26.680]   In greater measures, Lord,
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:30.040]   help us to trust you with our daily struggles.
[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:31.040]   In greater measure, Lord,
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:35.160]   help us to have the simplicity of a confidence
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.840]   that God, what you say is so,
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:39.840]   and God, that there would be no ifs, buts,
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.420]   and doubts about it.
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:43.200]   I pray, Father God, that in that way,
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:45.640]   you would strengthen our inner selves.
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:48.080]   And Father, I pray that as we walk then in faithfulness
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:50.880]   to you, God, that you would use us,
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.880]   you would use us in mighty ways
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:55.600]   to proclaim of the wonderful works that you do,
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:59.700]   not just simply in provisions and earthly blessings,
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:03.400]   but ultimately, God, that you have redeemed our very soul.
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:06.080]   Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling,
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.000]   to make you stand in the presence of his glory,
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.760]   blame us with great joy,
