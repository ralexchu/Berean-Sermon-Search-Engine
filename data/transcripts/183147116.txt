[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   If you can keep, turn your Bibles to Romans Chapter 6,
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   our main focus this morning is in Verse 12-14,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   but I'm going to start reading from Verse 5, Romans Chapter 6,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   starting from Verse 5.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   "For if we have been united with Him in a death like His, we shall certainly be united with Him in a resurrection like His.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   We know that our old self was crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died has been set free from sin.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   We know that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again. Death no longer has dominion over Him.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   For the death He died, He died to sin once for all, but the life He lives, He lives to God.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body to make you obey its passions.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   as those who have been brought from death to life and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law, but under grace."
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Let's pray.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank You for this morning. We thank You for Your living Word that convicts,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   that judges, encourages and strengthens.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   We ask, Lord God, that You would give us soft hearts, that we would be like clay, easily moldable.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And we pray, Father God, for Your grace to be sufficient. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   You know, there's a lot of things that we do when we're little kids that we just do because our parents tell us.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   You know, if you're raising kids, you tell them to brush their teeth and they don't really understand why.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   You can tell them that their teeth are going to get rotten, but they just do it because you tell them to do it.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   So when you're young, you expect them to do it. They don't have to understand. They just need to obey.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   But at some point in maturity, they learn why this is important.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   So every single one of you have, at some point in your maturity, realized that if you don't brush your teeth,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   your teeth are going to get rotten, your breath is going to smell, and you're going to look funny.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And so at some point, you understood why it was important, and so you took it upon yourself.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Nobody tells you to do it. You just do it because you understand the consequences if you don't,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   and you understand the benefits when you do.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Spiritually speaking, we go through the same process.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   When we're younger, we don't know much, so we say, "Well, what are we supposed to do?
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Are we supposed to come to church on Sunday? Are we supposed to read the Bible? What does this mean?"
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   But at some point in our maturity, we have to understand why we're doing what we're doing,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   or else it just loses its meaning.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Or you may just stop doing it completely.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   You may just read the Bible when you're a young Christian because somebody told you to do it,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   and you kept accountable when somebody said you have to do it.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Or maybe you'll have accountability groups that tell you if you don't read your Bible,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   you're going to have to buy boba for the rest of the group.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And so that's your motivation for why you're doing it.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   But at some point, you have to mature enough where you understand the consequences and the benefit,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   and so you choose to do it. And that's part of maturing.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Why we do something is just as important of what we do.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   There's a reason why Paul has spent five and a half chapters in the book of Romans,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   in the introduction of the gospel and his ministry, without mentioning one imperative.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   We talked about that, that the first imperative that we see in the book of Romans
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   happens in Romans chapter 6, verse 11, when he says, "Consider,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus."
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   That's the first command.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Prior to that, all of it was about who God is, in light of who He is, who we are,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   in light of who we are, what Jesus has done, and because of what Jesus has done,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   what has happened to us.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   So basically, he set the foundation to teach us why we need to live,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   why we need to respond in certain way.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Because it is absolutely essential.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Why we do, why we come to church and worship God, why we study the Bible,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   why we pray, is absolutely essential to what we're doing.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   If, having said that, if all we know is why, and then you don't practice the what,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   it is just as detrimental.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   The author of Hebrews rebukes the readers of Hebrews in Hebrews chapter 5.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   He says, "By this time you ought to be teachers."
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   But he says in verse 14, the reason why they weren't maturing, he says,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   "But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil."
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   So spiritual maturity is not just learning the why.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   So because of the why, then the what.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And that's what he's transitioning into in chapter 6.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   He's told us the foundation behind who we are, what has happened.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Basically, it was a detailed presentation of the Gospel.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   He's not done yet. He's going to continue on with this.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   But then based upon that, he says, "This is what needs to happen."
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   That's exactly what he says again in Romans chapter 12, verse 2.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed first by what?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   By the renewing of your mind."
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   We need to understand what has happened.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   What do we believe? Why do we believe this?
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   In order for us to practice what it is that we profess to believe.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Paul, now, is going to transition.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   He's already transitioned to verse 11, but we're going to continue with this transition of imperatives.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And he's transitioning, basically, in this text, in verses 12 to 14,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   it is a call to the good fight.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And that's exactly what he's going to say. He's going to tell us to fight.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Fight for our sanctification. Fight for righteousness.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   In our culture, a lot of people think that sanctification is just choosing the right boat to be on.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   I've chosen, and I've been justified, so if I just get on this boat and just relax,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   and it's just going to take me to God.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   That's not the picture that we see in Scripture.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Paul constantly reminds us, and he reminds his disciple Timothy, in 2 Timothy 2.12,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   to commit to fight the good fight.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Ephesians chapter 6.11, that we do not battle and fight against flesh and blood,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   but against spiritual forces.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   He describes this Christian walk as, in the Greek word, agonai, an agony, a marathon,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   to wrestle and to persevere through.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   In verses 12 through 14, the image that he shows us in this struggle
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   is about the kingdom, it's about reigning, it's about dominion,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   and even the word that he uses to present yourself as instruments of righteousness.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   The word instrument in other parts of the Bible is translated to weaponry.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   So again, after painting the picture of what has happened,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   he says, "You were at one point part of this kingdom,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   now you are part of the kingdom of God, and there is this struggle that is taking place in these kingdoms,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   and now you must live according to what has happened to you."
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   So, in these few verses, he's going to give an exhortation.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   One is a negative exhortation, not to do something,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   and then he's going to give a positive exhortation to do something.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And that's how it is outlined this morning in verses 12 to 14.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   First, a negative. He says, "Do not let sin reign in your mortal body."
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Do not let sin reign in your mortal body to make you obey its passion.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   So the first thing is what not to do.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   What not to do is don't allow sin to have utter dominion over your life.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   To have absolute control. And the reason why he says that is because that's basically the gospel message.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   The gospel message basically was that at one point you were under the dominion of sin and death.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Now you've been delivered from that. Now stop living that way.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   You know what's interesting is he says that he's very specific about what you're wrestling with.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   He said, "Don't let sin reign in your mortal body."
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   So let's stop a minute and talk about what he means by mortal body.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   When we say, "Well, he's just human," or "He's just a mere mortal," what do we mean by that?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Do we mean like, "Oh, he has superpowers?"
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Right? "He's powerful." No, typically when we say, "He's a mere mortal," we're saying, "He's weak."
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Right? "He's frail." Ultimately, it means that we're eventually going to die.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   We're finite people. So when he says, "Don't let sin reign in your mortal body,"
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   automatically we know that Paul is saying every single human being who has a flesh
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   has a corrupted flesh that we have to wrestle with until the day we die.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Paul actually spells this out in 1 Corinthians 15, 42-44.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   "What is sown is perishable. What is raised is imperishable."
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Perishable basically means that we're all rotting.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   I know some of us are rotting faster than others, but we're all rotting.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   No matter how much time, effort, and money, and cream that you put on yourself, right?
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Every single one of us. I mean, we can prolong our youth for a period.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   We can spend millions of dollars just to prolong it, but that's all you can do.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   You can prolong a little bit longer.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Every single person who has flesh is inside that which is perishing.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And that's why when that is perishable, when it is sown, it will be raised imperishable.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   He says, "It is sown in dishonor. It is raised in glory."
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   It automatically tells us that by living in this flesh, there is dishonor that we're going to be wrestling with.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   When you accepted Christ, did the temptation disappear?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   If you say yes, talk to me afterwards, because whatever secret that you have,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   nobody else knows about it.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   When you accepted Christ, the temptation didn't disappear. It was still there.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   You still struggled with lust, pride, greed, anxiety.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   All of these things still are dwelling in us.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And that's what Paul says, that if you have the flesh, it is sown in dishonor, and yet it is raised in glory.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   It is sown in weakness. It is raised in power.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   It is sown in natural body. It is raised a spiritual body.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   And so what Paul is saying, he is assuming that every single Christian,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   again, he's talking to Christians here, not non-Christians,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   every single human being that has this flesh will have this temptation and weakness and dishonor
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   along with this physical body.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   So basically, Paul is saying, "Fight against this flesh."
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   And you know what's interesting here when he says to fight?
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   He says, "Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness."
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   The word "present" in the King James, in the New King James, is translated "yield."
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Do not yield.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And the word literally means to just come alongside and just let it happen.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   Yield.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Whenever you're driving, you see a sign that says "yield."
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Basically, you're supposed to go there, and if there's nobody there, you go.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   But if there's another car coming, you're supposed to slow down and let them go.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   That's the imagery that we see here where Paul says,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   "Do not yield yourself to the temptations of your flesh."
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   That's the literal translation of what he's saying.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Do not to let it reign.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Because every single one of us, every single day, wrestles with temptation.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   See, the difference between wrestling with temptation and yielding to temptation
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   is just allowing it to just have its free reign.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   We all struggle with pride.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Every single one of us.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Typically, we're deceived to think that the people who are loudmouthed and have a lot to say,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   like, those are the proud people.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   But I found, again, from years of counseling and talking to people, being around a lot of people,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   that pride is a problem with every single person.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Introvert or extrovert.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   People who talk a lot and don't talk a lot.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Pride is inside of all of us because the core of our rebellion against God
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   is to want to have the glory that our Father has.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   That's what Satan wanted. That's what Adam and Eve wanted.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   That's what happened at the Tower of Babel.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   At the core of our rebellion against God is self-exaltation.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   That's what he says, remember, Romans chapter 1?
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   They refuse to acknowledge the Creator and give credit to the creation,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   which is made in their own image.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   So at the core of who we are, we struggle with pride.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   And as long as we're in this flesh, pride is going to be right in there with us.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   There's a difference between struggling with pride and yielding to pride.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   When somebody says something and then you say, "You know what?
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   I'm just going to not let that guy get away with this."
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   And you're yielding to it.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   There's a difference between struggling with lust and yielding to lust.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Where you just kind of justify yourself.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   It's like, "Well, where do you draw the line? Everybody does this."
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   And so that's just the way it is.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   And then you yield yourself. You're no longer struggling.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   We all struggle with greed.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Who doesn't want to live comfortably?
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Who doesn't want more things?
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   It's one thing to be struggling and being tempted by that.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   It's another thing to yield to that and say, "You know, I'm just going to give in.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   That's just the way it is. I'm going to have it all."
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   See, Paul is saying that as long as you're in this flesh,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   that temptation is going to be there.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   And you don't have to commit to commit these sins.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   It's always there. It's always knocking at your door.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Lust is always knocking at your door.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Your pride is always knocking at your door.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   It's the difference between struggling with that and just letting it have control.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   So Paul, again, knowing what it is that we have in Christ,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   do not yield yourself so that sin would reign in your mortal body.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   So if you do that, it will continue and cause you to commit even more sins.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Now, if Christianity was all about what he just said, right?
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   And if that's all you know about Christianity,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   you're probably one miserable person, right?
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Imagine living in this world, you know, and you see what everybody else sees.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   You see all the new technologies coming out.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   You drive in a nice neighborhood and you see nice houses.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   It's like, "Oh, that's nice. It would be nice to raise my children in that house."
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   You see Facebook and all the great places that people have gone.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   All the things that you can have.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   All the things that your head is filled with thinking, "Oh, it would be nice.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   It would be nice if I went there and did this and ate that and lived there and bought this."
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   And then you come to church and he said, "You can't have it!"
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   You can't have it! If you're a Christian, you can't have that!
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   That house looks awesome, but you can't have it!
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   "I want to eat that food." No! You can't have it.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Pick up your cross and deny yourself if you want to be a disciple of Jesus Christ.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   If Christianity was, that's all it was, what a miserable way to exist.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   If that's all you know of Christianity, of course you're not going to persevere.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   It's like a man starving to death constantly hanging around at a buffet.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Hoping somebody will spill it and it will accidentally enter your mouth so you don't have to feel guilty.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   I mean, that's how Christianity is sometimes.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   It's like, you know what I mean? It's just about denying.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   But that's not what Paul says.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   There is that negative aspect of, "Do not yield yourself to the flesh so that it would rain."
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   But then here's a positive one.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   He says, "But present yourself to God as those who have been brought from death to life,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   and your members to God as instruments for righteousness."
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Again, the word "present" here is to yield.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Yield. Just like there is, if you're living in this flesh,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   there's this constant temptation knocking at your door, tempting you with lust, greed, pride, anger.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   But along with that, if you are a genuine Christian, the old wineskin has gone.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   The new wineskin has come.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   The Bible says the Holy Spirit is indwelling in us.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   And not only is there a temptation knocking at your door,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   every Christian has the Holy Spirit also knocking at your door.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   See, that is the hope that we have in Christ.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   It is not simply about denial.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   It's about embracing life that the Holy Spirit desires for us.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   2 Corinthians 5, 1-4.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Again, Paul says, "For we know that if the tent,"
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   and the tent he's referring to is this physical body,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   "if the tent which is our earthly home is destroyed,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in heaven.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   For in this tent we groan."
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   As long as we are in this flesh, he says that we are groaning,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   longing to put on our heavenly dwelling.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   For every Christian, there is a groaning inside of us, desiring to be with the Father.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   If indeed by putting it on we may not be found naked,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   for while we are still in this tent we groan, being burdened.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   As long as we are in this flesh, we are burdened by temptation,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   we are burdened by desires,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   but there is this groaning for the life that He has promised in eternity.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   As much as there is a knocking on your door,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   so that sin may reign over your life,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   there is also a knocking by the Holy Spirit that is constantly groaning
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   to bring you closer to the Father.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   In Romans chapter 8, 22 it says,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   "For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   in the pains of childhood until now.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   And not only the creation, but we ourselves,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   who have the first fruit of the Spirit, groan inwardly."
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   He's not just talking about the Apostle,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   he's not talking about just a few select Christians.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Every Christian who has the Holy Spirit in him,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   there is a groaning inwardly.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   And what is that groaning?
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   What is that groaning?
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   He says, "We groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for the adoption as sons."
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   The redemption of our bodies.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   That is the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   A non-Christian is constantly living under the temptation of their flesh.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   As though it just go.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   And that's why they are under its dominion.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   But for Christians, we still live in this flesh,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   and until we are completely delivered from this flesh,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   we still have that same temptation.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   But the difference now is, we have the Holy Spirit also groaning
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   and fighting to bring us to the Father.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   This is not something where he is saying that it may happen to some people.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   It is happening.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Every Christian, every Christian, there is a groaning that God has placed inside of you
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   that cannot be satisfied until you are with Him.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Paul again says that in Philippians 2.12,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   "Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   but much more in my absence, work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   For it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure."
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   You see what Paul says here?
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   He says, "You need to work out your salvation with fear and trembling
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   because God is already going that direction.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   The Holy Spirit is already pushing you toward that direction.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   The Holy Spirit is groaning to cause you to work out your salvation with fear and trembling."
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   He says it again in Colossians 1.28,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   "Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   that we may present everyone with true Christ for this I toil,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   struggling with all His energy that powerfully works within me."
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   He wasn't simply saying, "Hey, work hard, be determined."
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   He is saying, "No, the Holy Spirit is already moving.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   He is working powerfully in you already.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   There is a groaning that is constant in you
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   that longs to be adopted for final redemption."
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   And so what he says is, "One, do not yield to that constant temptation knocking at your door.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Instead, yield yourself to the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Yield yourself to God as instruments of righteousness."
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   We are no longer helpless in our sins.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   You may feel that way at times,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   but what Paul is saying here through the Holy Spirit
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   is no Christian is helpless in his sin.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   See, the difference between a non-Christian who is struggling with guilt
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   versus a Christian who has guilt upon him,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   a non-Christian has no answer for his sins.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   So when guilt comes upon him, it leads to condemnation and more guilt.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   But for a Christian, when guilt comes upon us because of our temptations,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   because of our sins, we have an intercessor between us and God
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   who has taken away the barrier between us and the throne of grace.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   And that is why he constantly invites us.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   We have a high priest who is sympathetic toward our weaknesses
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   because he once walked in this same tent that you and I struggle with.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   And so we are no longer helpless in our sins.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   So he says, "Do not yield to the flesh, but yield to the work of God."
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   You know what's really interesting about these commandments?
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   The tense for the negative and the tense for the positive instruction is different.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   In the English, you can't see that.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   In the English, it seems like it's all present tense,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   that we have to continue to wrestle against our flesh
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   and continue to wrestle for the things of God.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   But you know what's interesting here?
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And I'm going to read what John Stott says about the tense here,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   and then I'll just explain.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   "Whereas the command not to offer ourselves to sin was in the present tense,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   indicating that we must not go on doing it,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   the exhortation to offer ourselves to God is in the aorist,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   which is clearly significant.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Although it may not be a call for a once-for-all surrender,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   it at least suggests deliberate and decisive commitment."
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Now, you have to understand the difference between these two tenses.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   The present tense is something that is happening now,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   it's continuing, and it's an everyday struggle.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Aorist tense is a simple past tense.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   It's something that happened in the past, it has an effect on it today.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Where Christ was crucified for our sins happened in the past,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   but it has its effect on us today.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   So the challenge to offer yourselves as instruments for righteousness
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   is in the aorist tense.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   So let me unpack that.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   What Paul is saying, what John Stott is saying,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   the commandment here for the present tense, for the negative is
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   that we are to continue to wrestle, continue to struggle,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   not to allow sin to have complete dominion over us.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Continue to fight.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   But the commandment, but the commandment
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   to yield yourself to the Holy Spirit
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   begins decisively at some point when we say, "This is who I am."
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   When you embrace the Gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   and you confess your sins, and you repent of your sins,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   that's not something that happens later on,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   saying, "You know what, I'm going to follow Jesus."
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   At some point decisively, when you gave your life to Christ,
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   this is what has happened.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   That you have decided to follow Jesus.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   And that was a commitment that you made.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   But for some reason, in our generation, in our culture,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   to decide to follow Jesus, and the decision to accept Jesus,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   have become two separate decisions.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   That you have some crazy Christians,
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   and then you have the normal Christians.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   You have the level 1 Christian, level 2 Christian, level 3 Christian.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   So level 3 Christians are the ones who do mission work,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   church planting, and forsake all things to follow Christ.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   And then you have the level 1 Christians who just accepted Christ,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   and just kind of ride this out.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   See, what Paul is saying is this decision to embrace Christ,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   and the Gospel message was a decision that every Christian made,
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   whether you know it or not.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   This is who we are.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   We have been crucified with Christ.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   We were buried with Him.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   And then we were also resurrected in His life.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   See, Winston Churchill had to give this speech to England
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   during World War II,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   where the Nazis were completely taking over Europe.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   It looked like that even France was going to fall, their greatest ally.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   And then they were going to cross the Channel,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   and their plan was to come and fight England.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   So Winston Churchill, as the Prime Minister at that time,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   had to rally the country up to gear up for fight,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   even though it looked bleak.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   And that, not sermon, but that, what do you call it,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   the speech that he gave is noted in history,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   because it kind of caused the resolve of the nation to fight against the Nazis,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   and eventually they ended up winning.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   And this is a clip, or a short verse from that speech.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Winston Churchill says, "We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   We shall fight on the beaches. We shall fight on the landing grounds.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   We shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender."
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Paul's imperative in verses 12-14
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   is a challenge to the Church to embrace what has happened to us.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   It's to embrace and make a decisive decision that this has happened to us.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   In Romans chapter 12-1 it says, "I appeal to you, brothers, by the mercies of God."
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   In the NIV it says, "In view of the mercy,
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   to present your bodies, to offer up your bodies,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   to yield your bodies as a living sacrifice,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual act of worship."
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Paul is not commanding us to do anything that God is not already doing inside of us.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   See, the challenge for sanctification isn't,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   "Hey, every desire is headed toward way, but deny yourself and go this way."
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   See, that's what sometimes we think Christianity is. It's quite the opposite.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   The challenge for sanctification, the application of what we know of the Gospel,
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   is basically, "God has begun a good work in you.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Now go with it. Live up to it."
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   That's why he's able to say, "Live up to the calling that you have been given.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Live up to it." He's not saying, "Earn it."
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   God already gave it to you. Now live consistently with what you profess.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   He says, "Live and resist and give as those who have been brought from death to life."
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   As people who have died, but also have been resurrected in this new life,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   where the Holy Spirit is dwelling, groaning inside of us,
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   who's working powerfully within us, to live as those people.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   And if we live in any other way, we're not living the way God intended us to live.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Years ago, when I used to play a lot of basketball,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   there was this one guy that we used to play basketball with, and he was about 6'1", 6'2".
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   And obviously, if you're 6'1", 6'2", you don't have to be the best basketball player.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   You just have to be there. Right?
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   The ball falls, put your hand up, pick it up, give it to somebody, and you're awesome.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   This guy would dribble the basketball, and he was an athlete.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   He could run up and down, he could dribble.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   But he had this weird habit of bending down when he would shoot.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   He would go like this, and awesome, and he'd bend down like this and shoot.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Every time he would shoot, we're like, "You're 6'2".
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   I can come behind him and squat him. Get that out of here. Right?
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   So every time he shoots the ball, we're like, "What are you doing?"
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Stop bending down.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   God gave you the gift of height. Stand up straight, put your hand up, and shoot it here.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   No one can block you. Right?
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   But for whatever the reason, he got this bad habit of squatting.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   So he shoots like he's 5' tall.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Even though God gave him 6'2". Right?
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   What Paul is saying is, live as those who have been brought from death to life.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   That you've been given this new life.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   To stop living like you're still bound in the flesh.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   That you're still bound in dominion of sin.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Like, "Oh, I have no control over this."
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   No. The Holy Spirit is working in you.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Isn't that why you come to church?
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Isn't that why you want to read the Bible?
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   You join small groups because there is an urging in the Holy Spirit that can't be satisfied unless you are at the center of his will?
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   That's what a Christian is.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   God opened our eyes to see the glory of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   And that's what we're attracted to.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   We want more of it.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   We desire more of it. We're frustrated when we don't get it.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   And so all sanctification is, is come and get it.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   The door has been opened. There is no barrier between you and the Father.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Come and get it.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   This life that you've been looking for.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   This peace that you desire so much.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   The love that you are craving is in the Father.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   There's nothing holding you back.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Come and get it.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   That's what he's saying.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Give up to the calling that you have been given.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   He says in 1 Peter 2, 9-10, "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light."
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   How does the Bible describe, how did Paul describe the fall of mankind?
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   All have sinned and fall short of what? The glory of God.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Because God created us to glorify Him.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   And the only way that we can glorify Him is to be in His glory.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   To be affected by His glory. To be near His glory.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   But when we sin, there was a barrier between us and Him.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And we can no longer do that.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   That's why our whole sin of mankind is described as falling short of that glory.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   So the restoration of salvation is to be restored and to be reunited with His glory.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   And not only are we reunited with His glory, we are to be proclaimers of this glory.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   And that's when we feel alive.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   That's when we feel alive.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   Isn't that your testimony?
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Isn't that what you've experienced if you are a true believer in Christ?
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Isn't that the real longing in your life?
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   That sometimes we try to dress up with having things and going places.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   And having the right friends and the circumstance.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   And we are all trying to dress this up, but if you are a genuine child of God, you know.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   You know that life is in Christ, in Christ alone.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   Isn't Jesus the one who said, "If you drink of the water of this world, you are going to be thirsty again."
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   You may quench it for a period, but you are going to be thirsty again.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   But the water I give you, if you drink of it, you will never thirst.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   The bread that you eat of this world, you will be hungry again.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   So if you are nibbling to find life in this world, there is a constant hunger and constant thirst.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   And you have to constantly dress that up by doing more and more things.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   But the invitation for us who know Christ, who have been redeemed,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   is that the seat of mercy has been opened up.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   Now come with confidence.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   And when we live at the center of His glory, glorifying His name, that's when we really live.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Remember the movie, "Chariots of Fire"?
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   I'll date it.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   Some of you guys may remember.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   "Chariots of Fire" was about Eric Liddell, who was the main character, and he was an Olympic runner.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   And he was a committed Christian.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   And he made news because he refused to run on Sunday because he wanted to have corporate worship.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   And that made a big deal about it.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   So they interviewed him.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   And one of the lines in the movie that really stuck out, and I think repeated over and over again,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   where they asked him about his running and his relationship with God.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   And this is how he described it.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   "I believe God made me for a purpose, but He also made me fast.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   And when I run, I feel His pleasure."
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   He said it wasn't about the running.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   It was about giving glory to God.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   But God made him fast.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   So when he runs for His glory, he feels His pleasure.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   That is the testimony of every Christian that's been born again.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   When we live our life to magnify and glorify God,
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   we yield ourselves to God as instruments of righteousness,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   we feel alive.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Yes or no?
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   And I think every Christian will say, "Amen."
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   Because that's why we're here.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   We can get easily distracted and put other things in the path,
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   and thinking like, "Oh, if we just did this, if we just changed this,
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   and if we just had this, and we have all these little things that we think,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   like if we just adjust it, if we just get the volume right,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   if we just get this right, and if we just do this, everything will be okay."
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   But at the end of the day, life is found in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   The reason why you may not be satisfied is because you may have drifted away
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   from the center of His glory.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   The reason why you're constantly adjusting your life to make it right,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   and it never seems to get on the right channel,
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   is because you're looking for the wrong channel.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Only when we are at the center of His will,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   the more we abide in Him, the more we live.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And He concludes in verse 14 with a declaration.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   "This is what has happened to us, therefore this is what you should do."
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   And then He concludes with this absolute declaration,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   "This will happen," verse 14, "for sin will have no dominion over you."
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Now it's not a challenge, it's not a command, He's just stating a fact.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   "If you're a Christian, for sin will have no dominion over you,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   since you are not under law, but under grace."
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   In other words, because God is not waiting for you to do your part,
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   to do His part, He's basically saying, "Go live."
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   He's telling us a fact, just like the book of Revelation.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   He's not saying that if you struggle and you get it right,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   and if the church does its job, that Christ is going to come and redeem,
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   and all this stuff is waiting for you if you get it right.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   The whole book of Revelation, in the context of chaos, struggle,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   that because of what Christ has done, it is the final chapter of human history,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   and it is absolutely victorious in the name of Jesus.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   It is not simply telling us what might happen,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   it's declaring what will happen because of what Christ has done.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   And that's how He concludes this section.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   If you are a child of God, if the Holy Spirit is dwelling in you,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   and it is constantly groaning to be with the Father,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   yield yourself to that.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Give yourself to that.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Because He who began a good work in you,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   He will carry it unto completion, until the day of Christ.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   So the challenge for us as Christians is,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   not simply to get on the boat,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   to come alongside and work and labor and toil and fight,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   along with the Holy Spirit who is already doing this inside of us.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   Would you take a minute to pray with me?
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   Because I know there's a lot of you in this room,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   where this struggle is real.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   In fact, let me say, not a lot, all of us, every single one of us,
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   we struggle with temptation, loneliness,
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   maybe anger and bitterness.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   And maybe some of you have just allowed yourself,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   you've given yourself to them, and let it have control over you.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   And you're miserable as a result of it.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   You don't find joy in that. You don't find peace in that.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   But as we are challenged and encouraged this morning,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   that you know that the Holy Spirit is constantly drawing you to Him.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   And maybe you've been resisting because of anger,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   because of bitterness, because of whatever it was.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   That you will come before the Lord and recognize what Christ has done,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   and now yield yourself, present yourself to God,
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   that we may be used as instruments of righteousness.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Sin will no longer have dominion over you,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   because we are not under law, but under His grace.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Let's take some time to pray before the Lord,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   asking the Lord to make it even more clear to us,
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   what it is that we have in Christ, that we may embrace it and live and worship.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Let's take some time to pray.
