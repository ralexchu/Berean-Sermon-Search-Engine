[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Leviticus chapter 26.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Okay.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Alright, so we only have two more chapters left.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   So we have 26.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Next week we have 27.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   A week after that is Thanksgiving.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   And then a couple weeks after that,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   and the week after that we have review.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   So we have about two or three weeks that we're going to be,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   take about a week to review and then a week or two to do something else.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   I'll let you know when we get closer to that.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   But 26, 27.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Before we get into this, last week the first discussion question that I asked was about the Sabbath,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   the application of the Sabbath.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   I've already gotten maybe about five or six different questions from different people.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   And so I wanted to address that before.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   How do you apply the Sabbath in the New Covenant?
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Now there's two extremes that you can misapply the Sabbath.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   One is where you take the literal teaching of the Sabbath in the Old Testament
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   and you try to apply it in the New Testament,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   where you say, you know, the Sabbath, you can't put gas in,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   you can't do any kind of work, you shouldn't do housework,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   you should pretty much be in worship all day, you know,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   you have to be in worship during the morning,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   and if you don't go to evening service at night, you're not keeping the Sabbath,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   then you have the wrong application of that
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   because the Old Covenant has passed away.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   That specific covenant of the Old Testament doesn't apply to us.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   The mistake on the other end is where we treat the teaching of the Sabbath
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   like all the other laws of the Old Testament, like none of it applies today.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Because in the Ten Commandments,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   we all believe that the Ten Commandments apply in some form today
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   because they're all moral laws, right?
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   They're all moral laws about, you know, not worshiping any other god,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   don't make gravy in images, do not take the Lord's name in vain,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   and then you have all these other moral laws about honoring your father and mother,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   thou shalt not kill, bear fault in this,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   all of these things are all repeated in the New Testament
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   except keeping the Sabbath, right?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   You shall keep the Sabbath holy.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   It's one of the Ten Commandments.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   So why is that ceremonial or civic, civil law
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   mentioned in the Ten Commandments, right?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Because God highlights that particular commandment above the other commandments
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   and it's placed in the Ten Commandments,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   which all of it is repeated in the New Testament
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   except for the specifics of keeping the Sabbath, obviously, on Saturday.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   We don't even keep the Sabbath on Saturday anymore.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   We moved it to Sunday because that's the day that Jesus was resurrected.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   There's huge significance behind why we worship on Sunday instead of Sabbath.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   On Saturday.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Because the meaning of Sabbath, again,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I'm not going to answer it for you and say,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   "Therefore, this is what you need to do on the Sabbath."
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   But we need to understand the principle behind the Sabbath.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   God made creation in six days, and then it says,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   "On the seventh day, he rested."
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   So in the Genesis creation account, when it says he rested on the seventh day,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   does that mean that he rested and then Monday he woke up again,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   he went back to work?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And then he worked another six days and then entered into Sabbath again?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   The second week?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   No. He enters into the Sabbath, right?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And it doesn't say that he ever comes out of the Sabbath.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   What happens when sin comes in,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   mankind gets separated from God,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   and the Sabbath for the man is broken.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   So even though he may observe the Sabbath on Saturday,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   the real Sabbath, the significance of the real Sabbath
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   is to be with his God, right?
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   So Sabbath is with God, so God--rest is with God.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   So if you're separated from God, you've broken the Sabbath.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   So the whole concept of Sabbath in the Old Testament
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   is another way of saying being saved,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   to be restored back into the presence of God.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   That's why Jesus says in the New Testament,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   the invitation to come to him is to do what?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   To rest. Those who are weary and heavy laden,
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I will give you rest.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   So over and over again, the Scripture talks about entering back
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   into the presence of God as entering back into Sabbath.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   And that's why this teaching of Sabbath was so significant,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   because it symbolized reunion with God.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And that's why it says in the book of Hebrews
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   to make every effort to enter the Sabbath.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   So the wrong idea of Sabbath
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   is to make regulations and say,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Sabbath means you shouldn't work, so therefore you can't do this,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   you can't do that, you can't do this.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Remember the Jews were practicing the Sabbath that way,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   and then they saw Jesus doing certain things, and then he said,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   "Oh, you're breaking the Sabbath." Remember what Jesus says to them?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for Sabbath."
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Meaning the Sabbath was given to him,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   not for you to have another bunch of things
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   that you should or should not do to earn righteousness,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   but it was to give you rest, to be restored back to God.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And he says that God is the Lord of the Sabbath.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   The Son of Man is the Lord of the Sabbath.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   So the principle of Sabbath is to find rest
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   and to be restored back to God.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   So if you make the Sabbath into a bunch of rules
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   that you should or should not do,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   you're repeating what the Jews were doing in the Old Testament.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   It was meant to be restoration of rest,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   but then you make it into a work.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   But to completely ignore the principle of Sabbath
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   is to ignore the importance of what this day represents,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   to be mindful of the fact that God set aside a certain time,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   a certain day for us to find rest and to be restored.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   So coming to church on Sunday, right?
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Again, not to check off and say,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   "I came and I gave worship on Sunday, so therefore I observe the Sabbath,"
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   but to connect with God corporately, right?
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Connect with God corporately to be restored, to be refreshed,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   to connect with God in Scripture, in prayer, in my quiet time.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   The principle of Sabbath needs to apply to every Christian.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   The reason why we don't as a church say,
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   "On Sabbath we do this and on Sabbath we don't do this,"
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   because then it becomes something that you have to do or you don't do.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   But again, the principle of Sabbath is something that every Christian
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   ought to be regularly thinking about, like, "Are you in the Sabbath?"
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Even in the way that we pursue sanctification, right?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Even in the way we pursue sanctification,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   if you pursue sanctification as of, like,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   "I'm going to work hard to be righteous, to be in the presence of God,"
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   you flip the concept of Sabbath,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   because the Sabbath is that God restores the rest,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   so therefore you work in the rest.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Does that make any sense?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   You don't work to get your way into the presence of God.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And that's why the Scripture says to live up to
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   the gospel that you have received, right?
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   To live up to it. In other words, it's been given to you.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Righteousness has been imputed to you. It's been given to you.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Now live what God has already given.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   So if you look at the Genesis account,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Adam and Eve, did they work or not work before the fall?
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   They did work. They were being fruitful,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   multiplying, subduing the land, and then when sin comes in,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   he says, "You're going to be working, but what's it going to produce?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Thorns and thistles from the sweat of your brow."
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Eve was created to be a suitable helper,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   but she's going to bring contention in the home.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Instead of being a helper, you're going to be next to him,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   but it's going to cause trouble.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   So what the Sabbath is,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   is a restoration of what was lost because of our sin.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And so how do we practice that in the New Testament?
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   So the idea of Sabbath in the New Testament ought to be, like God did,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   so these are principles that are taught in the Old Testament.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   They set aside a specific day so that they do nothing else
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   but to come before God and find rest and to worship
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   and to reconnect with the Father.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   So for the New Covenant people,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   we move the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   because Jesus' resurrection
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   restored the Sabbath for Christians.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   So we no longer practice the physical Sabbath, but the spiritual Sabbath.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   So we do practice the Sabbath,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   but we have to practice the Sabbath with Christ in mind,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   to connect with Christ.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   That's our ultimate purpose, to rest in Christ.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   You cannot work all day and not practice Sabbath.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   You can sit around and do nothing all day and not practice Sabbath.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   You can come to church and have morning and night service
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   and not practice Sabbath
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   but it's the physical Sabbath that we are to practice in the New Covenant.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Okay?
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   All right, I'm out of breath already.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   So chapter 26.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Let me pray first and we'll jump in.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for allowing us to study the book of Leviticus.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   I know there's a lot of things in here that we still don't fully understand,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   but we thank you, Father God, that you've taken time
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   to prepare the nation of Israel, Lord God,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   and all these things just bring greater light
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   into what we already believe and what we've already been affected by.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   I pray that the few more sessions that we have,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   that you would continue to open our eyes,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   help us to connect the dots, that we may have a greater sense of awe
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   in the things that you've already given.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   All right, so let's jump right in.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   So this chapter 26 is part 2.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Remember we talked about how the three chapters,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   chapter 25, 26, 27, is exhortation on how to live a blessed life in the Promised Land.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   So God's teaching them that when you get into this land,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   these are the things that you ought to do.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   So in chapter 25, he talks about when you get in there,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   make sure that you practice the Sabbath.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Practice the Sabbath for yourself, practice the Sabbath for the land,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   practice the Sabbath economically and socially, right?
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   And every 49th and the 50th year you have the year of Jubilee,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   every 7th year you have the year of the Sabbath,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   and then every 7th day you practice the Sabbath, right?
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   And then chapter 27, if you've already gone there,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   the very last chapter, ends with how to redeem certain things.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   What can be redeemed, what can't be redeemed,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   what are the valuations?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   So if you haven't gone there already,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   I'm just going to give you a heads up, a warning,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   that some of you, if you don't understand what God is doing in chapter 27,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   some of you are going to be very offended.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Because he begins to give monetary value on women,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   on men, on children, on older people, and younger people, infants, animals.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   And so if you don't understand what he's doing,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   it will sound kind of like, "Okay, you're more valued and you're of less value."
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   But obviously it points to something much deeper than just what you see on the surface.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   So that's what he talks about in chapter 27,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   how does God want us to redeem certain things, right?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   So chapter 26 is about the covenant of blessing and curses.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Now this list of what curses you bring if you disobey,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   what blessings you get if you do obey,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   this is not the only place that's written, right?
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   There are other places where there's a list,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   in particular in the book of Deuteronomy.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   But that's, again, the overview, that's where we are.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   We're in the second part of the three-part at the end of the book of Leviticus
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   that if you want to live a life that is blessed by God,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   these are the things that you ought to do.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   So blessing and obedience, verses 1 to 3.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   He says, "If you obey, God will provide rain in their season
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   so that they will bear much fruit."
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Now what I want you to pay attention to,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   what blessings that God's going to give,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   you're going to notice that everything that God gives them
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   is something that God already gave to mankind.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Like rain in season is, they're supposed to come in season,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   meaning that God ordained this particular season out of the year to rain.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   And he says, "But if you obey, I will not withhold the rain, I will let it rain."
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   So if you'll notice, all the things that he promises,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   "If you obey," is exactly what he intended to begin with.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Basically what he's doing is he's taking the consequence of sin
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   on mankind and on creation, and he's kind of withholding that.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   He's withholding his wrath against mankind.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   So obedience doesn't bring something new.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Obedience is restoration, it was what he's already given.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   So it's not like God is withholding anything good.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   This is what God gave to mankind to begin with,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   but it's sin that blocks us from his blessing.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   So if you take the sin away, the blessing that he intended in creation
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   is going to be given to you.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   So you'll notice that everything he mentions here in this part
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   is basically a description of Garden of Eden.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   He says he will give security so that they may enjoy fruits of the land.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   In other words, they're going to walk around, and there are no enemies,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   there are no wild beasts, so they're going to be able to enjoy life,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   enjoy food, enjoy family, without having to worry about danger.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   God will give peace in the land, verses 6 through 8.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   And the way he describes peace is that they will sleep in peace
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   without having to fear their enemies.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   There are no enemies.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Enemies are a direct result of the fall.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   The hatred between Democrats and Republicans is a direct result of the fall.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   The animosity between husband and wife is a direct result of the fall.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   The reason why we have locks on our doors is because it's a direct result of the fall.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   The reason why we have police officers guarding our streets is a direct result of the fall.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   He says that when obedience, when we obey, and God comes to protect us,
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   there is no need to worry. We will be able to sleep in peace.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   He will eliminate the harmful beasts.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   For people who are living in the city, at most you might be worried about coyotes.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   We don't worry about wild beasts.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   But if you've ever been to a part of the country where they're living out in the open,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   which is what they probably were used to.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Remember, I think I shared this before, I asked our Indian pastors,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   what's the greatest danger they faced in sharing the gospel?
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   And they said they ran into a tiger.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   They didn't run into the tiger, but they were in the open field
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   and they saw a tiger coming from way over there.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   And then so they hid behind the rock, and if the tiger smelled them,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   they would have been done.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   But the tiger never came by. He said that was probably the scariest.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   I was expecting the Hindus throwing rocks at them, and they said, "Tiger."
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   And then I was in Kenya, and in the rural side of Kenya,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   the biggest problem over there were elephants.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   And they said the elephants, I think they said it was the number one killer of man in that area were elephants.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   We would never think of elephants as being dangerous because we usually see them in zoos.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   So when he says there's no more wild beasts, to us, like where we live, we can't relate.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   But imagine when at that period of time, and you're a farmer,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   and you had wolves and whatever animals coming by,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   he says that when that day comes, remember if you look at the Garden of Eden,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   there was no hostility between man and animals.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   They were coming, and Adam was actually beginning to name them one by one.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   So all this is a picture of the Garden of Eden before sin comes in.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   And obviously to the nation of Israel, when they enter the Promised Land,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   they are going to be surrounded by enemies.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   But if the enemies do come, he says he promises victory.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   God will grant them to be fruitful and multiply.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Again, what was broken because of the fall.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   God told them to be fruitful and multiply, and that's exactly what they were doing until sin comes in.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   And they are no longer able to be fruitful or to multiply because of their sins.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   In fact, the very first fruit that Adam and Eve have, what happens to that?
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   They are two sons, and one gets murdered.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   He says when God blesses you, you're going to be fruitful and multiply.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   The Lord will make his dwelling in their midst.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   And the reason why all of this is possible is because the Lord is in their midst.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   So if you remember in the book of Genesis, when Adam and Eve fall, what is the first thing that happens?
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   They hide from each other, and then they hide from God.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   So they were shunned from the presence of God.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   So therefore the Sabbath was broken because the rest is in God.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   So he said all of these things come because God is among them.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   The reason why the enemies can't touch them? Because God is with them.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   The reason why they are able to be fruitful is because God is with them.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   The reason why the animals are not hostile is because God is in their midst.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   He says he will walk among them.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   So this is a different picture because in the book of Leviticus, where is God?
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Where is God in the book of Leviticus?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   In Exodus, he's up in the mountain.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   In Leviticus, where is he?
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   He's at the tabernacle, so he's in their midst.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   But he's in the tabernacle.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   But he says in obedience, where does he say he was going to be?
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   He's not just going to be within them, he's going to be walking with them.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   So it's a much more intimate scene than even at the tabernacle.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   There is no barrier.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Does that happen in the nation of Israel?
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   I mean, the actual fulfillment of that, it happens in the New Testament with Christ,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   because the Holy Spirit makes an indwelling with us.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   And that's why we are commanded to walk with him.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   But in Leviticus, he dwelt among them, but he does not walk with them.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   And then he says the motivation behind that, why you can trust God that he would do that,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   he says because he's the one who brought them out of Egypt.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Anybody memorize Romans 8.32?
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   He who did not spare his own son, how will he not along with him give him all things?
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   In other words, God's the one who delivered them out of Egypt.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   He is more than willing to restore the blessing.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   In fact, we're going to go through all of these different curses,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   but God's heart for the nation of Israel is the blessing.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   The reason why he gives all of these warnings is so that they can stay in the narrow path
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   and live in the blessing of God.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   That's his ultimate purpose.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   He said, "Why would I deliver you out of Egypt and go through all of that drama just to punish you?"
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   So he's reminding them, "I'm the one who delivered you out of Egypt.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   I'm the one who loves you. I'm the one who cares for you."
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   So you can trust that if you obey my commandments, that these are things that God is more than eager to do.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   But the problem is the curses for the disobedience.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   As in Deuteronomy 28, the curses far outnumber the blessings.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   So if you look at it, verses 1 through 13 is about the blessing.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   If you obey that these are the things that God's going to do,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   and then two-thirds of it, 14 to 39, is about the curses.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Just like in the book of Deuteronomy, 13 verses of blessing, but 53 verses of curses.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   So if you've ever read through the list, you'll have maybe about half a page of blessing,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   and then two or three pages of curses.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   If you do this, this is what's going to happen.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   We know in the new covenant why God does that.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Because one, he knows what's going to happen, right?
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   And he's preparing them.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   He's preparing them for the coming of Christ, so that the burden of this curse will be made clear to them.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   You understand?
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   He says, "What was the purpose of the law? To make sin, what? Utterly sinful."
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   So in other words, Israel...
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   The reason why God lays in detail these curses is that every year of their life,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   and every decade of Israel's history, this is curses being piled up.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Right? Curses being piled up.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   So hundreds and hundreds of years of disobedience, by the time Malachi finishes,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   there is no way to get out of this debt.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Right?
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   We're not just talking about one generation.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   We're talking about generations and generations of sins that have piled up, one on top of the other.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   And so by the time Christ comes, there is no way possible.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   I mean, there's no way possible, even in the beginning of Israel's history, to pay off even one sin.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Right?
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   But God wanted to make it absolutely crystal clear.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Every curse that God says that they deserve, at some point in their history, broke it.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   So every one of these things that he says, "These curses are going to come upon you,"
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   every one of these things, at some point in their history, they broke it.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   So all of these curses were upon the nation of Israel before Christ comes.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   And he does that, again, to show them their need for Christ.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Again, the curses were not simply meant to punish, but to restore his people back to obedience.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Even though it points to Christ, it doesn't mean that God didn't want them to live in obedience.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   Of course he did.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   But the ultimate fulfillment of all of this was going to come upon Christ.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Many of the curses were the exact opposite of the blessing that were to be promised.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   He said, "If you obey, I will give you land. If you disobey, I will take away your land.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   If you obey, you will conquer your enemies. If you don't obey, your enemies will conquer you.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   If you obey, the wild beast will not be among you. You will be able to rest.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   If you don't obey, the wild beast will divide your families, and you will not be able to rest."
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   And all of this is, "Is God among you walking, or is he not?"
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   And if he is not, sin is going to have its way in your life.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   And that's what he's basically outlining.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   What happens when God is walking among you, and what happens when God is not walking among you?
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   That's the difference between blessing and curses.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   In the cursing, there's five groupings of curses.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Each one increasing in intensity.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   When you read this, did this remind you of any other book?
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   No?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   But when you read these cursings, did it kind of trigger anything that we studied in the past?
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Last time?
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Revelation, right?
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   You know, you have the seven seals, and then you have the seven trumpets, and then you have the seven bowls.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   And then each one increasing in intensity.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   And then by the time it gets to the end, it's like a punch in the mouth.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   And then the question is, "Why does he drag this on?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Why does he go seven, and then another seven, and then another seven?"
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Remember we talked about that?
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Why this drama of seven years, plus another seven years, and another seven years, or seven one of them?
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Remember we talked about that?
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Yes?
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   He does that, again, increasing in judgment, and each part, what does he do?
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   He's waiting for them to repent.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Even if there's one more soul who's going to be scared out of their minds, saying, "Oh my gosh, he's real.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   This judgment is real," and to bring them to repentance.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Because once the final judgment, the great wine-thrown judgment comes, there is no other judgments coming because it's finished.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   It's complete.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Hell is opened up, and then it's finished.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   So even in this judgment, you'll see, you know how he says over and over again, "Sevenfold."
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   If you don't listen to this, another sevenfold.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   It's going to be increasing.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   And so each one of these, it starts off by saying, "After I've done this, if you do not repent."
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   In other words, every judgment that's coming is to get them to repent.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Get them to see that what God said he's going to do, and then he does it, and then he waits for them to repent.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   If they don't repent, he brings the second round.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   And it's going to be even more severe, and he does this four separate times.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   And then if you notice, at the end of it, the judgment is absolutely severe.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   And then they get taken away from their land.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Complete.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Right?
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   So it kind of reminds you of the judgment in the book of Revelation.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   So even in this severity, he's giving opportunity for repentance.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   He says, "Although all throughout it, the Lord repeats, 'I will do these things to you.'"
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   He repeats it over and over again so that there's no mistake that this happened because of lack of planning,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   because they lacked money, or they made some bad decisions.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   He says, "No, the Lord is doing it."
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   So they understand that this is coming as a direct judgment against them because of their disobedience.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   So repeatedly over and over again, he says, "I will do this. I will do this."
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   In Amos chapter 4, 6, I'm not going to read all of it.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Amos describes how God brings judgment upon the nation of Israel,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   and each phase that he's done that, they wouldn't repent.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   "I gave you also cleanness of teeth in your cities and lack of bread in your places,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   yet you have not returned to me," declares the Lord.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   "Furthermore, I withheld rain from you while there were still three months until harvest,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   then I would send rain on one city and on another city.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   I would not send rain. One part would be rained on while the part not rained on would dry up.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   So two or three cities would stagger to another city to drink water but would not be satisfied.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Yet you have not returned to me," declares the Lord.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   So over and over again, he describes his judgment that he's bringing upon the land,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   and sometimes selectively, to teach them.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   This is coming because of your sin. This is related to your sin, and yet you would not repent.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   And then so what is the final judgment of the book of Amos?
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   There's going to be a famine, but a famine of what?
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   A famine of the Word of God.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   In other words, God's going to withdraw his spirit.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   That's going to be the final judgment, when he releases you to your sin.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   And that's what it says in Romans chapter 1, 2, right?
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   He gave them over to their lusts. He gave them over to their iniquities.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   That's his final judgment.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   So the final judgment after the great white throne judgment is there's no longer common grace.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   God separates the ones who will be separated from him for eternity,
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   and then those who will be dwelling with him for eternity.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   So even in this separated state, we all experience common grace,
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   Christians and non-Christians alike, because we're not in hell.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Because of God's grace and his glory, where we are living is not orderly sinful.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Yes, God is still here. The church is still here. The gospel is still here.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   We're not in the final state, but the final state of judgment is when God withdraws his presence.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   And so that's where he says he's making sure that they understand that there is no mistake,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   that they didn't make poor choices, and that's why the harvest is not growing,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   or the rain, or the enemies are conquering, because they didn't sharpen their sword.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   He said it's directly linked to their disobedience because of their sins.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   And that's why the first part, right? He said there's five phases,
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   but the first part, 6 through 7, he said it's going to be sudden terror.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   In other words, it's going to come suddenly so that they know that this is divine.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   It comes out of nowhere because God brings it. The disease is going to be severe.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   This is not the regular disease that people have living in a sinful world,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   that you're not going to have problems that are going to be lingering for years and years.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   It's going to be a severe disease, again, so that people will know that this is a divine judgment coming from God.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   They will sow uselessly because their enemies will pillage and eat them.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   They're going to work hard, and they're going to sow seeds.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   They're going to do business, but at the end of the day, the enemies are going to come and take it from them,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   so it's going to be useless. All their hard work to become something is all going to be destroyed by their enemies.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   They will be defeated and conquered by their enemies as a result of the Lord setting His face against them.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   And Moses says that. You know, when they were out in the desert,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   God's angry with them. He says, "I'm not going to go with them," and Moses begs,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   "If you don't come with us, we're going to die out here in the desert.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   We're completely vulnerable. These people were slaves.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   They're not soldiers. They have children with them, and they're out in the desert.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   So if you don't come with us, we're vulnerable to any attack.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   There's no way they're going to enter the Promised Land and conquer these fortified cities.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   The only reason why people trembled at the nation of Israel was because of the reputation of their God.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   God says He's going to withdraw His presence among them, and then they're going to—
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   humanly speaking, it's a bunch of nomads wandering in the desert who aren't properly trained, just walking around.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Who would be afraid of them? He said that's exactly what's going to happen.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   If you don't obey, God's presence is going to be withdrawn,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   and then they're going to become vulnerable to every attack, every enemy.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   As a result of that, they're going to flee when no one is pursuing them.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   Isn't that what anxiousness is? Anxiety?
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   There are things that you should genuinely be anxious about.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   War breaks out, enemies come in. You should be anxious.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   If you're not anxious, something's wrong with you.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   When you're anxious, when there's no reason to be anxious, that's when you know something is wrong.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   He said that's what's going to happen. There's going to be fear that dictates your life
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   because you no longer have—what don't you have when God's not there?
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Peace. You don't have peace. You don't have Sabbath. You don't have rest.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   So your spirit is in constant unrest, even when you're not being chased.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Isn't that so true? Even as Christians, when we have sins that are hidden, that are unrepentant,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   there's a constant fear, even in the judgments that you make,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   that if it goes wrong, it's because God's going to do it.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   At some point, God's going to discipline you. There's a fear.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   And so it makes everything that you do anxious—your relationships, the business,
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   even the money in the bank, whatever career that you have.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   You're constantly living in fear because you are living against the will of God.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   And so that's how he describes somebody who is living in disobedience.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   He's fleeing even though there's nobody chasing him.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   And sin is the direct cause of all of that.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   Secondly, if they do not turn from their sins again, right?
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   After he's done all of that, and they still harden their hearts,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   he says he's going to bring judgment upon them sevenfold.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   They will be humbled, verse 19a.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   If you really think about it, disobedience is self-exaltation, living self-willed.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   I'm going to be somebody, I'm going to do something, I'm going to make a name for myself.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   And then he says God's going to come bring judgment and humble them.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   Severe famine is going to come upon the land.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   And then he uses the word again, "useless."
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   "The strength will be spent uselessly, because the land will not produce trees and thus no fruit."
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   So the first judgment is going to be useless, even though it's going to bear fruit, the enemies are going to take it.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   The second judgment, they're going to work hard, but there's not going to be any fruit to begin with.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   You see the severity of the judgment?
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   The first judgment, you actually have fruit, but the enemies are taking it.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Second judgment, the trees don't even come, because the famine is so severe.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   So you can see the intensity, so it's going to happen sevenfold harder.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Third, if the previous judgment doesn't bring them to repentance to God,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   God will increase their plague again sevenfold according to their sins.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Wild beasts will decimate their families and their cattle.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   So they're not just living in danger, right?
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   He said they're going to actually come and decimate, they're going to completely destroy them.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   So this is not just one animal roaming around, people locking their doors.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   He said they're going to come completely devastate whatever it is that they have.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   So you see this increase.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Fourth round, if the previous judgment does not bring them to repentance,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   God will act with hostility against them and will strike them again sevenfold for their sins.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   It's going to be increasing.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   The enemies will bring the sword against them.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   So the enemies are not just coming taking their food now.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   They're not just plundering, they're completely wiping them out.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Remember Israel's history?
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   The first round when Israel goes into captivity, the northern kingdom, the southern kingdom.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   The southern kingdom gets taken by the Assyrians and then the northern kingdom.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   I get that north and south mixed up.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   The southern kingdom, the northern kingdom, they go to the Assyrians and then the southern kingdom, they go to the Babylonians.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Where the Babylonians come and they take the prime into their land, the Assyrians come and completely decimate them.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   He says that the judgment that God's going to bring is going to be that they're going to come and completely wipe them out.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   God will send pestilence so that they will be defeated by their enemies.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   And then again, famine will besiege the cities.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   You see the progression?
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Enemies are going to take your food.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   Enemies are going to come and they're going to bring the sword and then they're going to besiege the city.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   And then he says, fifth, if after all of that they still will not repent, he said that punishment is going to increase sevenfold.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   And look at this judgment.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   They will eat the flesh of their sons and daughters.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   It for sure reminds you of the seven seals.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   Out of the seven seals, trumpets and the bowls, which one is more severe?
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   The bowl judgment.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   A third of the world is wiped out.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Plagues coming upon the land and how can anybody survive?
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   And that's how it's described, the severity of the judgment of God.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   And all for what purpose?
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Waiting for them to repent.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   God will deliver their idols in place of worship for those idols.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   He's waiting and waiting and waiting to destroy their idols and come to him.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   They won't destroy it.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   So they begin to experience this intense famine.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   The enemies come, besiege the land.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   They actually begin to eat their children's flesh.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Does this happen in Israel's history?
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   Yes.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   They actually experience this in Israel's history.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   God himself is going to come and destroy the idols.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   But that doesn't lead to revival because God comes as a judgment to do that.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   And then the next one he says, their cities and sanctuaries will become desolate
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   and God will reject their offerings to the Lord.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   In other words, God's going to end this nation.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   The whole purpose of the book of Leviticus is to make God's dwelling upon them.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   He destroys the sanctuary.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   What does that mean?
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   God's presence is no longer there.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   He's withdrawn.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   There's nowhere for them to go.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   And that's what Amos says at the end of the book of Amos.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   After I've done all of this, you still wouldn't repent.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   And then the famine of the word.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   You're going to be staggering from place to place to hear God's word,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   but you're not going to hear it because God withdraws himself.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   He says that in Revelation 2 to the church of Ephesus.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   He's doing all these things, but if you do not repent because you've forsaken your first love,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   he said, "I will take away my lampstand."
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   Lampstand represented the seven churches, one of the seven churches.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   When he says he takes away his lampstand, he's basically saying he's withdrawing his spirit.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   As a result of God withdrawing his spirit, they will be scattered among the nations
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   because what brought them together was God.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   So if there's no temple, there's no worship, there's no presence of God,
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   then there is no nation.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   They are scattered.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   And as a result of that, the land will enjoy the Sabbath that God commanded them to obey.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   They wouldn't obey it, so they're forcing them.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   Now think about why the Sabbath on the land.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   Because God created, remember, he creates heaven and earth, you know, like five days.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   He creates everything that was necessary on earth, and then he creates man.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   Because man is dependent upon the fruit that comes from the land.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   So if the man is disobedient to the Sabbath and he destroys the land,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   there is no food for him to eat.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   There is no harvest for him to take care of his family.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   So judgment, naturally he brings judgment upon mankind when he disobeys.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   Obedience is what causes the fruit in the land.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   Disobedience destroys the land, which they are dependent on.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   That's the foolishness of sin.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   The very thing that God created to sustain us, in our disobedience we destroy.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   That's what sin does.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   The very thing that God created to bring blessing, when we disobey him,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   the very things that cause joy in our life, in our sins, we end up destroying that.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   And that's what he's trying to, the picture that he's trying to show us.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   The land will enjoy the Sabbath.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   Those who remain will live in fear of their enemies and will have no strength.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   And then eight, those who remain in the land will consume them and they will rot away.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   In other words, even the people who are not taken away, the few remnant that are there,
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   they're going to be living in fear because the land is not in peace, because God is not there.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   All of this is fulfilled in Israel's history.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   It doesn't happen immediately, but hundreds of years later, after, remember we talked about that last week, right?
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   Seven times seventy, right?
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   They didn't obey what God told them to do.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   So 490 years they disobeyed God.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Seventy years, every year that they ignore the Sabbath, they go into captivity.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   And then when they go into captivity, some of them are utterly destroyed by the Assyrians,
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   some of them are scattered, and the ones who remain in Jerusalem are under constant attack by the enemies,
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   exactly as it is painted here.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   So this actually happens in the nation of Israel.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   But with the blessings and curses, he ends in 40 to 46.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   Despite all of that, if you will repent, God will forgive you, right?
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   God will remember their covenant once again if they confess their sins and the sins of their forefathers.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   Despite all of that, he still hasn't given up.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   Even after all of that, if you wake up from it and repent, he said he will forgive.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   And then the land will be rested as it should from the beginning.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   God's going to cause it to rest.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   So you can kind of see, like if you know Israel's history, if you know the book of Revelation,
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   if you know redemptive history, you know that all of this stuff actually takes place, right?
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   Exactly as God says.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   But the point of all of this is not to simply scare people and say, "Hey, don't mess with God."
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   The point of all of this is all fulfilled in the New Testament.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   So remember we talked about that, all prophecies, there is an immediate application to the nation of Israel.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Does God want Israel to practice all of this? Absolutely.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   Are there consequences if they don't obey? Absolutely, because it actually happened in the nation of Israel.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   But the final product of all of this wasn't about Israel.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   It wasn't about the promised land. In fact, Hebrews chapter 11 tells us that, right?
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   If what they were really seeking was land here, like peace here, they could have easily went back and had a great life.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   But their eyes got open and it is because of their faith they pursued a greater land, a greater promise, right?
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   And he says nothing that was promised physically they received.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   Because what were they waiting for? Us, right?
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   They were waiting for us, for us to come to faith and that we may all enter the promised land together, right?
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   The new heavens and new earth.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   So all of this ultimately points to the fulfillment in Christ.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   In Galatians chapter 3, 10-14, "For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse,
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   for it is written, 'Curse is everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law to perform them.'
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   Now that no one is justified by the law before God is evident, for the righteous man shall live by faith.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   However, the law is not of faith. On the contrary, he who practices them shall live by them."
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   He doesn't mean that he who practices the law, he's going to actually find life in it.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   If you are looking to become righteous by the law, right?
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   And if that's your standard and you're not seeking righteousness by faith,
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   then you're going to have to find it in the law.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   In other words, you have to obey this perfectly.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   You have to obey it to the point where you deserve no curse, only blessing, right?
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   Obviously, that's not possible. And that's what he's saying here.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   If you seek righteousness by the law, you have to find it by the law.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   There's no Bs. There's no A-minus. It has to be A++, 100%. Right?
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   But the Bible makes that clear. All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, not most.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   So he's not saying that you can find it. He's saying that there is no hope if that's where you're going.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   "However, the law is not by faith. On the contrary, he who practices them shall live by faith.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us."
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   That's where the fulfillment happens.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   That all the curses that he mentions, Christ absorbs the curse upon himself,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   that we might become the righteousness of God.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   In order that Christ Jesus, the blessing of Abraham, might come to the Gentiles,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   All of this ultimately points to Christ.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   Revelation 21, 3-4, it talks about the fulfillment of that promise of blessing.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   So verses 1-13, right?
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   Think about all the blessings that he mentions there.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   And he says, "And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   'Behold, the tabernacle of God is among men.'"
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   In other words, God is with us.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   "And he will dwell among them, and they shall be his people, and God himself will be among them.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and there will no longer be any death,
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   there will no longer be any mourning or crying or pain.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   The first things have passed away."
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   All because he is there.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   Heaven is heaven because God is there.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   Heaven is not heaven because God made it beautiful and then he said, "Hey, go and enjoy."
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   All of that is a byproduct of his presence.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   So when Genesis says that he created the earth on the seventh day,
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   he entered into the Sabbath, all mankind was in heaven with him.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   The Garden of Eden was a form of heaven because he was there.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   So when sin came in, we were broken from that Sabbath, outside of heaven.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   But now, when we enter into the new heaven and new earth,
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   it's going to be even a greater one than the one that we fell out of.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   The distinction is, we're no longer near him.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   The scripture says because of what Christ has done, we become adopted children of God.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   And the Holy Spirit now actually makes a dwelling in us.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   How long does that dwelling happen?
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   It's permanent.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   Our connection with Christ is permanent.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   So now we only experience in part, but when we are glorified,
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   we will be with him forever in that state.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   Again, in Revelation 21, 22-27,
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   "I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb are its temple.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   The city has no need of the sun or the moon or the shine on it.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   The glory of God has illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory in it.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   In the daytime, for there will be no night, and its gates will never be closed."
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   What does it mean the gates will never be closed?
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   There's no need for protection.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   There's no enemies to come in.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   You don't have to lock your doors.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   That's what he's saying.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   In heaven, you will have no enemies.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   "And they will bring the glory and the honor of the nation into it,
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   and nothing unclean, and no one who practices abomination and lying
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   shall ever come into it, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life."
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   In other words, sin is going to be wiped away.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   No unbeliever will be in this place, right?
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   Only the righteous, cleansed by the blood of Christ.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   Finally, in Revelation 22, 1 through 5,
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   "Then he showed me a river of the water of life, clear as crystal,
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   coming from the throne of God and the Lamb in the middle of its street.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   On either side of the river was a tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit,
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   yielding its fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   There will no longer be any curse, and the throne of God and the Lamb will be in it,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   and his bondservants will serve him.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   and there will no longer be any night,
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   and they will not have need of the light of the Lamb nor the light of the sun,
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   because the Lord God will illumine them, and they will reign forever and ever."
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   So all the blessings that he's talking about in verses 1 through 13
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   is going to find its final fulfillment in glorification when he comes.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   So all of this has immediate application to the nation of Israel.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   So they experienced all the cursing,
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   but even with all the cursings that came upon them, it was only a shadow.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   The nation of Israel did not receive God's full wrath.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   Even when we are disciplined, no human being alive has ever experienced the full wrath of God.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   We would not be living.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   Everything he does is for the purpose of discipline, to bring us to repentance,
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   because the ultimate wrath is going to be at the right throne of judgment and in hell.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   But until then, we're living in a period of grace,
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   that even as we are being disciplined, he's trying to bring us back to restore us,
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   to bring people to repentance,
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   to bring us to this place that he's describing in the book of Revelation.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   All right, so the discussion question for tonight.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   One, since Christ took away the curse of the law,
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   does that mean that there are no physical consequences for disobedience in the new covenant?
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   So the answer to that is no.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   Okay, just in case somebody goes off tangent.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   So read Hebrews chapter 12, 1 through 15.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   And so discuss along the lines of what you read there.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   What is the greatest thing you look forward to in heaven?
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   What is the curse of living in this sinful world that you wish to be delivered from sooner than later?
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   Do you understand that question, the second part?
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   Everybody experiences some, what curse feels like,
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   because we are all living under the larger umbrella of a fallen world.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   And I don't have to mention to you, whether it's from your family,
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   or something happened to you, or somebody did something to you,
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   or maybe something you did, that you have a hard time forgiving.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   You have a hard time letting go.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   All of that because we live under the umbrella of living under the fallen world.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   And all of that will be restored by the blood of Christ when we get to heaven.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   What is it that you look forward to when you think of heaven?
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   Third, what do you tend to meditate more on, the blessing of God or the curse of God in the fallen world?
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   How does either affect your day-to-day life?
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   So that question basically is, if you're not careful,
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   even though we say, "Oh, God loved me and he died for me and we sing great songs,"
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   but you can live day-to-day thinking about how your boss is bad,
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   people cut you off, you don't get paid enough,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   you know, how your body hurts, and so how much of your day is spent
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   thinking about the ramification of the curse,
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   rather than the blessing of what God has given.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   And how does that affect your day-to-day life when you do one or the other?
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   Okay? So let me pray for us, and I'll let you guys get into your group.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
