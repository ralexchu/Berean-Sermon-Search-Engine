[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to 2nd Chronicles 6, verse 12, and I'm just going
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.640]   to read a short section and the rest of it I'm going to read as we go through the passage.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.080]   This is where Solomon and Israel, after they're done building the temple, dedicated it to
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.080]   the Lord.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.520]   So what I want to do is follow the pattern that Solomon gives and use that as a pattern
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:32.840]   for us to come before the Lord and ask for His blessing over our church and over what
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.840]   we are doing.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.880]   So 2nd Chronicles 6, verse 12-17.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.800]   Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all assembly of Israel
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.920]   and spread out his hands.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.720]   Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high,
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.240]   and had set it in the court.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.920]   And he stood on it, then he knelt on his knees in the presence of all the assembly of Israel
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.400]   and spread out his hands toward heaven and said, "O Lord God of Israel, there is no God
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.440]   like you in heaven or on earth, keeping covenant and showing steadfast love to your servants
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.920]   who walk before you with all their heart, who have kept with your servant David my father
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.920]   what you declared to him.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.260]   You spoke with your mouth and with your hand have fulfilled it this day.
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.480]   Now therefore, O Lord God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father what you
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.200]   have promised him, saying, 'You shall not lack a man to sit before me on the throne
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.200]   of Israel.
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.560]   If only your sons may pay close attention to their way, to walk in my laws as you have
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.080]   walked before me.'
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.240]   Now therefore, O Lord God of Israel, let your word be confirmed which you have spoken to
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.240]   your servant David."
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.520]   Let's pray.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.040]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you so much for today.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.480]   We thank you for this week and as crazy as it was and just through human eyes, just what
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.880]   we as a church together went through.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.160]   We thank you for all the servants.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.120]   We thank you for the people that you brought together.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.200]   We thank you for the facility that we have where we can focus our energy, Lord God, on
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.640]   the things that matter.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.760]   We pray, Father God, that this would not be a distraction, but only cause your church
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.820]   to be focused even more.
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.280]   Help us to understand your heart as we search your word.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.280]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.680]   Amen.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.400]   The dedication of the temple that is listed here in 2 Chronicles and also in the book
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.120]   of Kings is a very important part of Israel's history.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.640]   Last week we saw that one of the benefits that the Israelites enjoyed was that Paul
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.920]   said theirs was the glory and theirs was the worship.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.600]   And one of the most tangible things that he talks about, obviously he's talking about
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.660]   the temple, that there is a physical place that they were able to come and serve and
[00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.420]   worship God.
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.040]   We want to follow the pattern of this wise man's blessing and there's some prophetic
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.240]   things that he says here that I think would be beneficial for us to just kind of go down
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.200]   the list and I want to follow this pattern with you.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:11.160]   So first thing is after he dedicates the temple, what he does is he builds a bronze platform
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.960]   and he stands on it and he kneels before the nation of Israel to make a public prayer asking
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.120]   the Lord to bless it.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.400]   And that was the dedication ceremony that he has.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.020]   That's the passage that we read.
[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.220]   And so after he does that he breaks out into public prayer asking the Lord's blessing.
[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.520]   And so the very first thing that he prays for in verse 18, and then we're going to go
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.280]   down the list of things that he prays for.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.080]   Verse 18, he says, "But will God indeed dwell with man on earth?
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:47.080]   Behold heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you, how much less this house that
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.520]   I have built."
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.820]   First thing that Solomon does, he acknowledges what the temple is not.
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.380]   Before we get distracted to think that somehow we're a better church because we have a building,
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.580]   has a nice facilities and technology, that somehow we've arrived, that that is not the
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.300]   case.
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.920]   Whatever problems that we had before we came into the building, we still have it.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.540]   Whatever things that we need to work on, having a building does not fix it.
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.500]   It doesn't cause us to love Christ more.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.020]   It doesn't cause us to be better disciples.
[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.700]   It's a building.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.140]   So first thing that Solomon acknowledges that our God is much greater than anything that
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.300]   he could have possibly built.
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.180]   Can we truly contain God in this small building?
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.740]   First and foremost, he acknowledges and he confesses that it is just a building.
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.740]   It is just a building.
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:45.860]   It is a better building, nicer building, larger building, better equipment, you know, these
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.580]   things, you know, my voice is bouncing off the wall right now, but we'll fix that, right?
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.020]   But it's a building.
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.660]   We know that in the end, the church is not the building.
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.620]   If people are attracted to come to church because we have a nice building, that is not
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.300]   the church that ultimately honors God.
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.920]   So first and foremost, we have to recognize what it is not.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.620]   It does not make us better.
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.460]   It does not make us stronger.
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.860]   It doesn't cause us to have to have better disciple making.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.220]   It doesn't cause us to be better organized.
[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.520]   We do have better facility, right?
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.700]   And don't get me wrong.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.700]   I'm excited.
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.420]   I'm excited to be here.
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.620]   And part of the reason I'm excited really was this week because this week physically
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.820]   watching the church physically build the church.
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.300]   And I remember I think it was Jason who said he showed up one night and he thought he was
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.220]   going to do some cleaning and light touching and maybe screwing some screws.
[00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.100]   And then he realized, shoot, we're actually building the church.
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.020]   You know, we had to put beams inside the church building and really we could not have done
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.100]   it without the church.
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.620]   I'm more excited about that, you know, that we can take ownership together of this church.
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.580]   But in the end, we need to first and foremost acknowledge before we do anything else that
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.080]   it is a larger room with better facility.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.340]   But despite that, the second thing that he says in verse 19, he says, yet, although there's
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.980]   no way that we can capture your glory just because we have a better building.
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:17.020]   So yet have regard to the prayer of your servant and to his plea, oh Lord, my God, listen to
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.820]   the cry and to the prayer that your servant prays before you, that your eyes may be open
[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.180]   day and night toward this house, the place where you have promised to set your name,
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.420]   that you may listen to the prayer that your servant offers toward this place and listen
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.140]   to the pleas of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place and
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.100]   listen from heaven, your dwelling place.
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:45.460]   And when you hear forgive the benefit of having a larger building that we can have more people
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.220]   praying and seeking the Lord, that despite the fact that it's just a building, building
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.220]   is a blessing.
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.180]   It is a blessing because our children can be taught Sunday school.
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.340]   Our parents don't have to worry about our kids running around in the parking lot.
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.460]   We have a place where we can have prayer meetings.
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.340]   We have a place where we can have Bible study.
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:09.740]   But more than anything else, that if the church is not a place where we meet God, then it
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.020]   just becomes a building.
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.460]   Then it just becomes walls.
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.820]   It just becomes superficial.
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:22.700]   It has to be first and foremost a place where people come to meet God, to cry out to God,
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.780]   to meet with him.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.460]   I remember when I was back in college, there's this particular chapel at Biola.
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.500]   I was on that campus for four years undergrad and a couple years in grad school.
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.020]   I was on that campus for about seven years.
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.100]   And during those seven years was probably when my faith was challenged and I grew the
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.100]   most.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:46.860]   I was discipled and there were periods of hardship in life and loneliness.
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.300]   And I remember that there's a particular chapel.
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.040]   Those of you guys, I don't know, some of you guys may know this campus, Rosemayor Chapel.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.420]   When I was going there, they had it open 24/7.
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.940]   So I remember countless number of days and hours I would spend in the morning and the
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.500]   afternoon and sometimes just sit there.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.180]   I don't have anything particular to say, but it was a time, it was a place where I could
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.860]   go to fellowship with my heavenly father.
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.020]   And there were many, many times I would just sit there and say, I have nothing to say,
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.200]   but I just want to be, I just want to commune with the father.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:25.500]   So when I think about meeting God, that place, that particular place has special meaning
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:30.460]   for me because I spent so much time in that room.
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:36.180]   I pray that our church facility will have that kind of impact on you.
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:39.860]   That when you think of the church, you don't think about the nice facilities and different
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.500]   things that you have, but this is the place that you would come to meet God.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.860]   That many, many years from now on, whether you are still attending this church or not,
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:53.100]   when you think of these years, that you can say, I remember sitting there crying out to
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.420]   the Lord.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:00.540]   I remember going into that room, having deep conversations where I met with him and I cried
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.620]   with him.
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:07.940]   And when I was lonely, this is the place I went and I pray as Solomon was praying, that
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:12.940]   despite the fact that it's just a facility, that God would bless this facility as a place
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:19.140]   where we'd have deep spiritual meaning and memories of meeting the Lord.
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.880]   That this truly would be a house of prayer.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.740]   He continues to pray in verse 22.
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:32.260]   He says, "If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath and comes and
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:36.980]   swears his oath before your altar in this house, then hear from the heaven and act and
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.580]   judge your servants, repaying the guilty by bringing his conduct on his own head and vindicating
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.500]   the righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness."
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:51.980]   His second prayer, and he opens up a long list of different prayers, particularly dealing
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.720]   with sin.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.720]   And the first thing that he mentions is fellowship, because there's nothing that ruins genuine
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.020]   worship and meeting God when there's contention in the church.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.880]   Now, obviously, whenever there's contention, it's always the other person's fault.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:12.300]   There's a reason why Jesus says in Matthew 5, 22, "Before, not during, not after, before
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.660]   you come to the altar, if the brother has something against you, go and deal with it.
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:21.060]   Reconcile with him before you come, because it's going to hinder your worship."
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:27.620]   There's nothing that ruins the church's prayer, the church's worship, the church's singing,
[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.300]   disciple making, than contentious relationships.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:35.660]   And that's why the first thing that he prays and recognizes, "Lord, hear our prayer."
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:43.180]   The first thing that he prays is, "Help us in our community that we would love one another."
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:49.260]   In Matthew 6, the Lord's Prayer, he says, "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors."
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.900]   That is a requirement of coming before the Lord.
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:57.420]   That if I want my prayers heard, first and foremost, learn how to forgive, learn how
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.660]   to receive forgiveness.
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:07.700]   Then he goes on and he talks about when disaster, when God disciplines because of sin, and we
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.980]   recognize that that is the case, that we would have enough sense to come to the Lord and
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.340]   repent.
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.780]   And when we repent, that God would hear our prayers.
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:21.220]   If you look at the bulk of the content of Solomon's prayer and dedication, it's about
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.300]   dealing with sin.
[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:30.420]   Dealing with sin against each other, dealing with sin because we've disobeyed God and disaster
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.340]   comes and we go to fight and we are defeated.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.460]   There's famine that's coming, there's a drought that comes, and he says, "When these things
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:44.380]   happen for the purpose of disciplining and you recognize the problem is our own sins,
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.980]   and to recognize that the only solution to these things is to come before the Lord in
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:52.060]   prayer, say, 'Please forgive us.'"
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:58.740]   See, the greatest purpose of this building, of our congregation, is reconciliation with
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.960]   our Father.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.540]   We can build great communities, we can have great children facilities, and we can have
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:10.300]   great social justice programs and all of these things.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:16.720]   But when Jesus says, "My house will be a house of prayer," first and foremost, it's a calling
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.560]   for reconciliation, to be reconciled with God.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.740]   Everything in Israel's history, all of their system, all the temple worship, every prophet
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:29.380]   that prophesied, all of it, at the core of it, is about reconciling with God.
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.500]   So the dedication of the temple is a dedication to come before the Lord is, "When I repent,
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.800]   would you hear?"
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.540]   Every single Christian that comes to this room must first and foremost come humble before
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.440]   the Lord.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.740]   Not with the idea of somehow I'm going to improve the church by doing this or doing
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.980]   that.
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:53.620]   First and foremost, to humble themselves and seek his face.
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:59.020]   See, in Hebrews chapter 12 verse 9, it says, "My son, do not regard lightly the discipline
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.860]   of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him.
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:06.300]   For the Lord disciplines the one he loves and chastises every son whom he receives."
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:12.260]   Do you realize that when Solomon is praying these things, that he is admitting the propensity
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.880]   of Israel to sin?
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.600]   This is the beginning of Israel's history.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.900]   This is at the peak of Israel's history.
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.840]   During Solomon's reign, Israel was the most powerful.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.000]   They were the most wealthy.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.840]   So humanly speaking, they would have naturally thought that the Lord blesses us.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.680]   We must be doing something right.
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.580]   We're able to go and conquer.
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.180]   Solomon did not experience much defeat among the enemies.
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:41.200]   So when he's praying these things, it's because he recognizes in his wisdom the propensity
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.800]   to sin.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.500]   And that's exactly what it says in verse 36, "If they sin against you, for there is no
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:52.680]   one who does not sin, and you are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.820]   are carried away, captive to a land far or near."
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.520]   Remember when he prays this prayer?
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.280]   It was hundreds of years before Israel was taken into captivity.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:09.400]   It is at the peak of Israel's success, he prays this prayer.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:14.080]   Because we have a propensity to sin, and when you bring judgment upon us, and we are taken
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.760]   away to the foreign land, and we recognize that it was our sin, and when we repent, would
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.680]   you forgive us?
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:26.240]   It is our propensity to sin why Christ came and died for us.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:34.520]   It is our propensity to be proud, to seek after things that do not honor God.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.280]   And this is the reason why Christ came.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.800]   This is why he established the church, and he said, "I will build my church, and the
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.440]   gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:50.800]   See, this dedication of the temple in his wisdom recognized, we need Jesus.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.960]   Now Solomon never mentions the name Jesus, because it was hundreds and hundreds of years
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:00.640]   before that is fulfilled, but everything about the temple was about the preparation of the
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.040]   coming of Christ.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:08.840]   And so he says, "When we sin, not if we sin, not if we mess up, but when we sin, and we
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.360]   recognize it, would you hear our prayers?"
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.560]   You know, but what's also interesting, he doesn't stop there.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.720]   He goes even further in verse 32.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:21.160]   He prays, "Likewise, when a foreigner who is not of your people, Israel, comes from
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.640]   far country for the sake of your great name, and your mighty hand and your outstretched
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:30.320]   arm, when he comes and prays toward this house, hear from heaven your dwelling place and do
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.520]   according to all for which the foreigner calls you to do, in order that all the peoples of
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:39.080]   the earth may know your name and fear you as do your people Israel, and that they may
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:44.920]   know that this house that I have built is called by your name."
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.440]   Israel's constant problem was they became insulated.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.560]   In fact, the whole book of Jonah is a rebuke to the nation of Israel.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.480]   What's it to you if I want to be merciful to the Ninevites?
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.640]   And so the book ends in rebuke, and it wasn't just a rebuke to Jonah.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.440]   It was about the whole nation of Israel.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:08.520]   God said, "You are my holy nation, a royal priesthood to declare his glory."
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.520]   To where?
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.520]   To the world.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:16.960]   Solomon, recognizing the propensity for the nation of Israel to become insulated and forget
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:22.960]   the foreigners, not realizing that God is for the world, not just for them.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.480]   He prays for foreigners that when they come, that they would be received.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.000]   Our church has entered the 20th year.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.040]   We're going to have our anniversary, and I think that one of the biggest temptations
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.800]   and the struggles that we need to watch out for is that after a few years, we no longer
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.160]   function and have vision as a church plant.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.440]   You know, when the church is first planted, we have this vision of reaching out to the
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.600]   lost, bringing non-Christians, and we evangelize and tell our friends and our neighbors and
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.600]   coworkers.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:59.320]   But at some point in the growth of the church, we get to a point where we say, "Well, that's
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:00.560]   enough about outside.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.760]   What about us?"
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.000]   And we forget why Christ established us.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.840]   See, I think it is a grave danger when we forget that we're here as Christ's church.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:18.880]   He established this church for His glory and ultimately for the gospel to go out to the
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.440]   remotest part of the world.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.640]   That's why if you look at the book of Acts, chapter 8, you know the conversion of the
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.640]   eunuch?
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:30.760]   And it's a strange part in the story because gospel begins to spread, and all of a sudden
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:37.400]   randomly this eunuch, Ethiopian eunuch appears, and he's reading Isaiah 53, and then he says,
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.640]   "Well, who's going to tell me this thing?"
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.480]   And Philip the Evangelist says, "Well, that's talking about Jesus."
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.600]   And, "Well, if that's the case, I want to believe."
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.600]   And he gets baptized and he's gone.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:51.480]   And this is all the history of how the early church started, and all of a sudden in Acts,
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.800]   chapter 8, eunuch appears and he disappears, gets baptized, and he's gone.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.360]   What was the point of that story?
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.920]   How does that fit into the narrative of the early church?
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.920]   In fact, if you look carefully, you'll know that the conversion of the eunuch was very
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:12.360]   symbolic because there is prophecy in the book of Isaiah that specifically says that
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:18.040]   when the gospel comes, the kingdom will be open to the Gentiles and to eunuchs because
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.540]   these were people that were considered unclean.
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.040]   So it was symbolic in Roman.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.600]   If you know the outline of the book of Acts, the gospel begins to go out from Jerusalem
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.840]   to Judea, to the remotest part of the world, in Acts, chapter 9.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:38.320]   So in Acts, chapter 8, is where the eunuch gets converted and a Jew reading this would
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:43.040]   automatically realize the gospel has been opened to the world.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:48.160]   See, God's intent was always the world.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:54.120]   People constantly ask me, "At what point will you be satisfied with the growth of the
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.120]   church?"
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:00.920]   And I know there's a tinge of sarcasm in there asking, "When will your ego be satisfied?
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.160]   Are you looking to make a mega church?
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:09.400]   At what point are you going to say it's big enough?"
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:17.880]   Sarcasm is my gift, so I usually respond in sarcasm and I'll say, you know, "7.4 billion."
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.600]   That's the number I have in mind.
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:28.440]   Obviously, what I mean by that is the church wasn't planted ultimately so that we can
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.840]   have a nice community of people, raise our children together, and then our children will
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.080]   marry each other, you know what I mean?
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.840]   And we're all family and great.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.800]   Like local church, everybody's here and generations of people living together.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.700]   The church was not planted for that reason, ultimately.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.640]   Those are all blessings that we have, those are all benefits that we experience, but in
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.440]   the end, it was for the world.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:57.400]   And we should not be satisfied until the world is reached.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.480]   He said when the gospel has gone to the most part of the world.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:06.000]   We have to be careful that we don't create an environment or culture in a church where
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.400]   only certain people are welcome, people who are like us, who's going to add to us.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:16.480]   A church, a real church, a church that God blesses, should be filled with all different
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:22.000]   kinds of people that we would never run into each other if we weren't Christians.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.560]   People that we would never talk to if we weren't Christians.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.680]   People who we would never live next to if we weren't Christians.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.560]   That's the beauty of the church.
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.620]   All age, all culture, all background, whoever that we're surrounded by, that we're not here
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:39.920]   to be insulated so that we can create a nice Asian American community.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:45.000]   Hopefully, that we would recognize that and even Solomon at the very beginning of the
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.920]   opening of the temple, he went to pray that they would not forget that vision.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:55.320]   That when the foreigners come, that they too may be able to worship you.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:00.680]   After his prayer, it is concluded where God shows up in 2 Chronicles 7.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.200]   As soon as Solomon finished his prayer, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.640]   offerings and the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord filled the temple.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.640]   So God responds.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.040]   How does he respond to his request?
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.160]   I mean, this was a good, godly prayer.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:21.000]   Recognizing their sin, recognizing their calling, asking the Lord to bless and humbling themselves.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.860]   It was a good prayer.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.300]   And so God, recognizing this, responds.
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.460]   And his response?
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.600]   He shows up.
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.800]   God shows up.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.920]   When God shows up, worship happens.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.960]   You know, we can talk about all the problems in the church.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.240]   We can talk about all the communication, all this stuff, and all of these things that,
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.840]   you know, we want to do better, we want to work on.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:49.120]   But in the end, what makes a church a church is God's presence.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.600]   It's God's presence.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.640]   God shows up in his glory, fills the temple, and the priest could not enter the house of
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.840]   the Lord because the glory of the Lord filled the Lord's house.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.600]   When all the people of Israel saw the fire come down and the glory of the Lord in the
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.520]   temple, they bowed down with their faces to the ground on the pavement and worshipped
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.520]   and gave thanks to the Lord, saying, "For he is good, for his steadfast love endures
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.520]   forever."
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.840]   It's great that we have a great sound equipment.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.240]   It's great that we have this building.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.400]   It's great that we have talented people, dedicated people, the finances to do what
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.120]   we want to do.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:27.160]   But all of that would be for nothing if God is not here.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.920]   What makes a church a church is that this is a place where we come to meet the Lord.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:35.520]   Now, of course, we know that God is omnipresent, that he's not just here.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.320]   But there's a special blessing when the congregation gathers together for corporate
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:44.080]   worship, for corporate prayer, to work together toward missions, to evangelize, to build a
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.960]   church.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.280]   But in the midst of all of that, worship, that we try so hard to get right every single
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.280]   week.
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.000]   There's a lot of people laboring so that worship can happen.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.560]   Parking attendants, those of you who are here today enjoying this, there's tons of people
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.480]   who've been here all week cleaning up, setting up.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.360]   Every little thing that's going around here was set up this week.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.640]   There are people here late till yesterday cleaning up, getting this ready.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:15.160]   And even now, we have dozens and dozens of people running around the church making sure
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.520]   that it happens correctly.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:24.200]   Sound room, these speakers, all of these things were hard labor.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.160]   What we are working so hard to have, and all of these things, again, it's because God
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.440]   has blessed us that we're able to do this.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:37.800]   But in the end, true worship is when we encounter God.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:43.200]   When we encounter God, when God shows up, they just fall down and worship.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.200]   And let me conclude what he says in 2 Chronicles 7, 14, 15.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:52.560]   In response to Solomon's prayer, God says to the nation of Israel, "If my people who
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:58.400]   were called by my name humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:03.160]   wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.160]   land.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:09.120]   Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place."
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:15.480]   As we dedicate not simply this building, but our church, you and me, using this church
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.440]   as an opportunity to rededicate ourselves to the Lord, that we would follow the same
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.200]   pattern first and foremost, before we gear up and say, "I'm going to do it," first
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:29.600]   and foremost, humble yourselves and pray.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.840]   Recognize that all our hard work would be for nothing if we do not humble ourselves
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.800]   and pray.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.960]   Humble ourselves, pray, seek his face.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:46.080]   That this is a church, this is a place, Bible study, Sunday school, our fellowship time,
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.800]   anytime we gather together, our primary purpose is to seek him and then ultimately turn from
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:55.280]   our wicked ways, our propensity to sin and stray away from God.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:01.560]   And God promises, "Then I will hear from heaven, then I will forgive your sins and
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:07.360]   I will heal the land and my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer that is
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.560]   made in this place."
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:18.120]   At Rosemary Chapel at Biola, I don't have to make much effort to pray in that room.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:23.900]   And I know it's emotional, because I have some ties, but I have so many memories.
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.520]   And sometimes you know how you go to certain places and certain smells and certain things
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.340]   kind of trigger memories.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:36.600]   I sit in that chapel and I remember years of praying and weeping at times in that chapel.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:42.240]   And I would sit there and the moment I sit down, I sense the Lord.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.120]   I pray that this church will be that for you.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.240]   That this is a place where you can meet the Lord, that where you seek him, where you pray
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.920]   to him.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.900]   And I know we have problems, I know things we have to work on, but let's not be distracted
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.880]   for the real reason why we're here.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:05.440]   You know, normally I don't write out my prayers, but I wrote out my prayer today and I want
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.960]   to follow the pattern that Solomon gave.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:14.280]   And I want to pray for the Lord's blessing, following the pattern that he gave.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:18.200]   And then afterwards our prayer team will come up and I'm going to invite you to take some
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.080]   time to pray along with us.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:31.080]   But again, follow along with me, you know, pray with me as I pray this prayer.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:36.900]   Dear Lord, thank you for being patient with us and so faithful with all of your promises.
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.520]   You truly are a God of compassion and mercy.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:45.080]   Your righteous judgment and decree is true from generation to generation.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.800]   We want to dedicate this church to you for your glory.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:53.920]   Let this place be a place where we truly love one another as Christ loved us, that the world
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.760]   will know we are his disciples.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:01.720]   Help us to make every effort to live in peace and unity with one another in genuine love
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.600]   before we come to worship each week.
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:09.080]   I pray that our fellowship will be a reflection of your patient love for us.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.480]   Protect us from the devil's work to divide and conquer.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.600]   Protect us from our own pride that causes us to want to be heard rather than to hear.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.580]   Help us to desire to serve rather than to be served.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:25.960]   We pray that Berean Community Church will be a place where sinners will find forgiveness
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.200]   and refuge in you.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.640]   Help us to embrace and love the outcasts and hurting sinners.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:36.720]   I pray that you would protect us from becoming self-focused, but to look upward and outward
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.520]   at all times.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:43.480]   Help us to recognize that you are sovereign over all things, that we may turn to you as
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.680]   our primary answer.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.200]   Help us to walk in the spirit at all times and not grieve the spirit in how we live and
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.940]   build this church.
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:55.640]   We pray that when you send the lost and heavy laden, that they would find a home in your
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.480]   earthly kingdom.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:01.720]   Help us to never forget why you've established this church and sent your only begotten son
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.040]   to die for this church.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:08.400]   Help us to love whom you love and to bring the light to the dark world we live in who
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.400]   are desperate in need of reconciliation with you.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:18.300]   Help us to recognize that true victories in Christ can only be had in abiding in him.
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:22.960]   We pray that the leaders will be humble servants more than dynamic leaders, men of righteousness,
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:27.640]   above reproach, first to serve and last to react in anger.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:34.040]   We pray that we would be first lover of Christ and his church before lovers of anything else.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.520]   We pray that Berean Community Church will be a house of prayer above all things where
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:40.720]   people can come and meet with you.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:46.560]   Hear our prayers and be attentive to the singing and worship given to you in this place, Lord.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:46.960]   Amen.
