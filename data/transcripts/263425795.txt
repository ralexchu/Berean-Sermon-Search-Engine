[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.680]   We want to welcome you to Cross Life and Breen Community Church is a Good Friday service.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.060]   And we want to welcome again all the brothers and sisters from Cross Life who have joined
[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.060]   us this evening.
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.640]   I think this is our third or fourth year that we're having this together.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.920]   And again, we're encouraged that we're able to do this together.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.040]   And Cross Life, as you guys know, our church knows, is almost like our sister church.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.920]   I've been to Cross Life many times to preach and Pastor James is almost our backup preacher
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.280]   for our church.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.240]   And so our church is very familiar with him and his preaching.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.680]   And we know we're a like-minded, like-hearted church.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.920]   As you guys know, Cross Life and Breen, we're working together for the missions going on
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.140]   in India.
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.120]   And so we've had several teams, several trips where we went together and then we're actually
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.120]   supporting.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.440]   And so the training, the pastoral training center that we have set up out in India, again,
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.800]   is with cooperation with BMC up north and Cross Life and the three churches are partnering
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.740]   together to do that ministry.
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.000]   And so it's only appropriate that we're able to be here and celebrate this sacred day together.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.160]   And it is a communion service.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.080]   And so we want you guys to be prepared for that.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.680]   That obviously every communion table is sacred and important, but especially tonight as all
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.480]   over the world, Christians are gathered together to remember his suffering for us.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.120]   And it's extremely important that we don't just recognize this as just another day and
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.480]   just another religious festival, because at the core of everything that we believe and
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.400]   everything that we do, if we're not moved and built up and challenged and compelled
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.640]   by what Christ has done for us, everything else just becomes just lip service.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.120]   And so as we listen to the sermon, as we participate in the communion, that we would recognize
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.480]   what Christ has done and then really pray before God that it would not become old news,
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.680]   but good news, and that it would change and challenge our hearts and prepare us for Sunday
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.680]   worship.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.760]   So at this time, we're going to ask Pastor James to come up and deliver the Good Friday
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.760]   service.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.760]   Let's welcome him.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.760]   All right.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.220]   Well, it's a joy to be here and to be worshiping the Lord together with you.
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.160]   And I thank you, Pastor Peter, for that gracious introduction.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.880]   You know, Pastor Peter has been a mentor to me, and I love spending time with him.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.840]   He always imparts wisdom.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.840]   I love gleaning wisdom.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.480]   And it really is, you guys are blessed to have such a wonderful and loving pastor.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.200]   And it's a joy that we can come together as churches.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.280]   I guess almost sister churches.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.760]   I just consider us sister churches.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.160]   But it really is a privilege, and I'm thankful to the Lord for our relationship and the fact
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.200]   that we can worship God together on this special night.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.400]   Well, today we're going to be preaching from the book of Luke, Luke chapter 22.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.680]   So if you have your Bibles, please turn with me there.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:03.280]   Luke chapter 22, verse 54 to 62.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.960]   Luke chapter 22, verse 54 to 62.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:22.840]   Can we all stand as we honor the reading of God's word?
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.280]   Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.760]   And Peter was following at a distance.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.240]   When they had kindled the fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.000]   sat down among them.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.960]   Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the light, sat in the light and looking
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.040]   closely at him, said, "This man also was with him."
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.040]   But he denied it, saying, "Woman, I do not know him."
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.280]   And a little later someone else saw him and said, "You also are one of them."
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.520]   But Peter said, "Man, I am not."
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.560]   And after an interval of about an hour, still another insisted, saying, "Certainly this
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.840]   man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean."
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.280]   But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are talking about."
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.560]   And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.560]   The Lord turned and looked at Peter.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.540]   And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him before the rooster
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.840]   crowed today, "You will deny me three times."
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.560]   And he went out and wept bitterly.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.880]   Please join me in prayer.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:27.440]   Lord Jesus, thank you so much for coming down into this world and burying our sins, burying
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.040]   our acts of rebellion, burying all the sinful thoughts and actions that we have done and
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.160]   dying for us in our place upon that cross.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.440]   Thank you so much for giving up everything that we might receive the forgiveness of sins
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.480]   and that we might have a relationship with you.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.440]   It's for that reason that we come here today to worship you and to give you praise, to
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.200]   remember what you have done, and to proclaim your death until the day that you finally
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.200]   come back.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.580]   And as we hear your word, as we listen to the book of Luke, may our hearts be moved
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.560]   and may we be directed once again to the beauty and the power of the cross.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.160]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.160]   Amen.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.400]   You may be seated.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.760]   On the Bible, I have a number of favorite characters, specifically three apart from
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.760]   the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.520]   Okay, everyone, Jesus is everyone's favorite.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.280]   But I have three apart from the Lord Jesus.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.920]   My favorite among the three is Samson.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.920]   So he's my favorite.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.120]   Okay, Samson is my favorite Bible character.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.920]   You know, beautiful hair, you know, chiseled body, ridiculously narcissistic, he's just
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.280]   a lot of fun.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.280]   My number two is a man by the name of Asaph.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.360]   Okay, he was a praise leader during the days of David and he led praise with symbols, right?
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.040]   So we wouldn't expect that from a praise leader nowadays, but I'm sure back in the ancient
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.680]   world he ripped it up, you know.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.400]   My third favorite character is a guy named Peter, Apostle Peter, the leader of the twelve,
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.640]   the great rock of the church, an individual whose life that we're going to study today.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.760]   In Matthew chapter 16, Jesus Christ asked the disciples, "Who do you say that I am?"
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.600]   And Peter said in Matthew chapter 16 verse 16, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.600]   God."
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.200]   And Jesus responded in verse 17 and 18, he says, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.640]   flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.200]   And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.960]   The gates of hell shall not prevail against it."
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.520]   Now, I mean, what a commendation from the Son of God, right?
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.480]   What a commendation, what an absolutely staggering pronouncement of praise.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.760]   But then right in the next scene, Jesus explains to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.080]   to die at the hands of the elders.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.200]   And Peter feeling all smug about his recent commendation takes Jesus Christ aside and
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.960]   this fool has the zazacity to rebuke the one whom he has professed to be the Son of the
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.960]   living God.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.120]   You don't have to have the wisdom of Solomon to know that you shouldn't be rebuking God,
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.120]   but this is what he does.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.520]   He does it anyway and he says, "Far be it from you, Lord.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.380]   This shall never happen to you."
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.240]   This ignoramus corrects the king of kings.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.200]   The will, he talks as if he knows the will of the triune God.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.160]   Then Jesus sharply responds and he says to him, "Get behind me, Satan.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.160]   You are a hindrance to me.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.560]   For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but you are setting your mind on the
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.560]   things of man."
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.400]   You're not thinking about the kingdom.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.600]   You're not thinking about salvation.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.800]   You're not thinking about redemption.
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.920]   You're not thinking about glory.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.140]   You're not thinking about life.
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.560]   You're not thinking about the things of God.
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.920]   You're thinking about the things of man.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.920]   You talk about a counter-rebuke.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.200]   That was a counter-rebuke.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.760]   Jesus went up to the Lord and just slapped him in the face.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.520]   Jesus Christ dropped, kicked him in the face with truth.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.240]   I mean, it's absolutely, I mean, it's powerful.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.720]   Can you imagine being called the devil?
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.280]   Can you imagine that?
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.000]   I mean, what a confidence killer.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.860]   You would think it just went a little bit too far, but it was the truth.
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.600]   One moment he was the rock of the church and the next he was the devil of hell.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.600]   That's why I love Peter.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.840]   That's why I love the guy.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.840]   I love him.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.840]   I love Samson.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.520]   I love Asa because I feel like they're as human as you can get.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.520]   They weren't like Daniel whose life was recorded without any blunders or shortcomings.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.080]   These men in contradistinction, they failed.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.080]   They fell short.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.480]   They used God.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.560]   They were disillusioned with God.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.880]   They forsook God.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.000]   So that if there was anyone that should have been rejected by the Lord, it should have
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.320]   been these men.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.760]   But by the grace of God, the Lord kept them.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.760]   God did not just keep them.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.760]   He used them.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.880]   The reason why I love these men, it's not because they were great, but for the very
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.200]   opposite.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.200]   They were horrible.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:52.360]   They had a moment's weakness, but their weakness and their failures testify to the
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.520]   greatness of our God.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.560]   That's why I love these men.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:03.060]   And that encourages me because if God can love guys like this, if God can love delinquents
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.920]   like this, then he can love a fool like me.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:13.760]   And if he can use broken vessels like them, then he can use broken vessels like us.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.720]   And I hope their lives will encourage you.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.600]   If you're the kind of person who has everything put together, if you feel adequate, if you're
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.680]   on top of your game, then the gospel's not for you.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.560]   You don't need it.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.560]   You got it yourself.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.640]   But if you come here with a cloud of shame hanging over your head, if you come here because
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.920]   you've backslidden for months or maybe even for years, if you come here knowing that you
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.040]   are far from being perfect, then this is the message for you.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.760]   Because Jesus Christ didn't come down to heal those who are well.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.400]   He didn't come to help those who were righteous in their own eyes.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.080]   He came to help those who were sick.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.120]   He came to help those who were sinners.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.680]   He came to die for those who needed life.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.280]   Today on this Good Friday night, we're going to peer into the death of Jesus Christ from
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.000]   the perspective of Peter's life.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.600]   And the single point I would want you to take home tonight is simply that Jesus Christ died
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.280]   for sinners.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.320]   Jesus Christ died for sinners like Peter and died for sinners like us.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.680]   Now before I get directly into the text in Luke chapter 22, I want to set up the context
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.680]   leading up to our passage.
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.160]   On the night before Jesus Christ was killed, he celebrated the Passover with his disciples
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.440]   and he instituted the Lord's Supper.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.640]   And together they made their way to the Mount of Olives and there the Lord, in anticipation
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.440]   of his impending death, he said this to his disciples.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.320]   This is from Matthew chapter 26, verse 31.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.840]   He said to his disciples, "You will all fall away because of me this night.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.840]   For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:49.080]   That after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee."
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.560]   Now this is a massive pronouncement, is it not?
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.080]   It's a massive pronouncement, a prediction of death and resurrection.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.440]   The moment has basically come for the atonement of sins, for the newness of life, the climax
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.920]   of redemptive history.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.680]   These are the words that elicit silence and awe from the hearts of men.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:10.160]   Even before the moment is given for the people to process this thought, Peter, as expected,
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.160]   he speaks out of turn.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:16.720]   He says in verse 33, Peter answered him, "Though they all fall away because of you, I will
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.060]   never fall away."
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.800]   If there's anything that should have stuck in this guy's mind, it was the fact that Jesus
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.360]   Christ was going to resurrect from the dead.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.760]   Who else makes a claim like the one that Jesus Christ made?
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.960]   To offer up his life and then to take it back up?
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.640]   To enter the grave and then to return?
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.560]   To go to the halls of the dead and return back to the land of the living?
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.280]   Who has the kind of authority like Jesus Christ?
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.600]   Who has this kind of certainty?
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.160]   But instead of marveling before the weight of the statement, Peter takes a proclamation
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.720]   of the gospel which is about the glory of God and he turns it around and makes it about
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.000]   himself.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.040]   The moment has come for the son of God to come down to save the world from their sins
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:56.200]   and the only thing this man can think about is his own magnanimous resolve.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.480]   Listen to how he says it.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:03.160]   "Though they all fall, although they all fall away because of you, I will never fall
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.160]   away."
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.720]   Listen to this guy talk.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.880]   He doesn't say, "Oh, no, I will never fall."
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:15.080]   But he says, "Even if they all fall away, even if they all fall away, I'll stand by
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.080]   your side."
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.680]   If I was one of the disciples, I'd be like, "That's kind of messed up.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.680]   You know what?
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.680]   Why you gotta say that?
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.760]   You know, just lift yourself up and there we go."
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.760]   You know?
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.680]   This is how he thought about himself.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.160]   He elevated himself.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.680]   But the Lord responded to Peter's arrogance.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:38.600]   In verse 34, it says, "Truly I tell you, this very night before the rooster crows,
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.220]   you will deny me three times.
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.160]   You will deny me three times."
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.840]   The Lord speaks, prefacing his words with a phrase of absolute certainty.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:54.000]   "Truly, truly, without any doubt, without a hint of falsehood, truly, I say to you,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.800]   the Messiah says to you, the Son of the living God says to you, is a proclamation of truth
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.640]   from the one who is the embodiment of truth."
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:06.480]   And he says, "This very night before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.400]   The words of Peter was just nothing more than that, words.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.520]   He didn't know what he was talking about.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.880]   But in full confidence of his own commitment, Peter responds and contradicts the words of
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.280]   Jesus Christ because, of course, Peter knows.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:22.600]   And he says, "Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you."
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.920]   And all the disciples said the same.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.880]   Instead of humbling himself before God, acknowledging the fact that he was weak, Peter moves in the
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.520]   exact opposite direction by elevating himself to the highest form of commitment.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.880]   He wasn't just going to stay by the side of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.760]   He was going to walk with him to the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.120]   It doesn't matter.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.840]   The grave will not separate him from the Lord.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   But then the next scene, the Lord takes Peter and James and John into the garden.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:53.040]   And he says in Luke 22, verse 40, "Pray that you may not enter into temptation."
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.640]   It was only a matter of time before the darkest hour of this world would come upon them.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.640]   Satan was scheming and his demons were working.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.880]   The corrupted priests were preparing.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.000]   The Roman soldiers were moving.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.920]   The blade was being sharpened for the slaughter of the Son of God.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.080]   And so the Lord took the inner three that they might pray to withstand the onslaught
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.120]   of the evil and the temptation that would come upon them.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.160]   And he withdrew from them and he prayed.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.960]   He fell down to his knees and he prayed to the Father.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.400]   He says, "Father, would you take this cup away from me?
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.720]   If there's any other way for the atonement of sins, if there's any other means for redemption,
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.720]   let that way be.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.120]   Let the cup of damnation be taken away from me.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.520]   Not my will, but let yours be done."
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:37.800]   The Lord prayed until his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.560]   The moment has come for him to bear the sins of this world.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.600]   The moment has come for him to be damned.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.920]   And when he rose from prayer, having found the strength to move forward, he turned to
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.320]   his disciples.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.600]   The men who were supposed to remain by his side, support him in the greatest hour of
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.600]   need.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.280]   The men who were to stand by his side, praying against the oncoming wave of temptation.
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.280]   These men were found sleeping.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.880]   Not only John, not only James, but the great Peter.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.000]   The great Peter, the great champion of Christ, the rock of the church, the one who will stick
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.320]   by the side of the Lord until death.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.440]   There he was, slumbering.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.800]   And we behold the great resolve of Peter.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.680]   What woke him up?
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.080]   Because his betrayer was at hand.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.960]   When Peter arose, he saw a most intimidating sight.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.080]   Looked up and there were hundreds of soldiers, hundreds.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.960]   According to the book of John, it was a cohort.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:35.600]   A cohort of 600 Romans, trained warriors and soldiers.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.080]   But then among them was a familiar face.
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.960]   He looked and there was a familiar face, somebody he knew, a friend, Judas.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.680]   And Judas made his way to the Lord Jesus Christ and greeted him as if there was nothing strange
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.680]   happening.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.160]   Kissed him.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.960]   And immediately the Roman soldiers approached the disciples, demanding for the one who was
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.520]   called Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:16:00.360]   And Jesus, unfazed, boldly came before them and he said, "I am he."
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.360]   And literally he says, "I am.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.360]   I am."
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.480]   And at the sound of the name of the divine God, the soldiers dropped down to the floor.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.160]   It was a sight to behold.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.680]   And Jesus, like the great shepherd and loving father, said to them, "If you seek me, let
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.680]   these men go."
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.680]   Right?
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.920]   "If you seek me, let these men go.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.920]   They have nothing to do with this.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:18.920]   Spare them.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:19.920]   Let them go."
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.360]   And it didn't take long for anybody to know what was happening.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.720]   It was the fulfillment of the Lord's words of him being betrayed.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.920]   He was not being delivered over for judgment.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:35.200]   But there was one prediction that would not come to pass, at least in the eyes of Peter.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.120]   That was his own failure.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.040]   Peter saw all this and this wasn't a time to give in.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.600]   Six hundred soldiers and it was not the time.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   He was ready.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:44.600]   In fact, this was his moment.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.920]   This was his moment to shine.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:50.160]   This was his moment to prove his faithfulness, to prove his loyalty, to prove his love, to
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.160]   prove his resolve.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.640]   See, they may all abandon him, but he will stand firm.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.840]   He will hold the ground.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.920]   He saw undaunted by the clubs and the swords, undaunted by the mob of soldiers.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.960]   He whipped out his sword and he charged forward.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.520]   And in Luke chapter 22, verse 50, it says, "And one of them struck the servant of the
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.240]   high priest and cut off his right ear."
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:12.720]   This is no other than Peter himself.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:20.240]   Now, I look at this text and I love how he picks out the slave of the high priest.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.240]   He picks out a slave.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.400]   You know, when I read this, I wonder why he didn't go after the soldiers.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:30.640]   Maybe because he saw the slave of the high priest as the servant of the one who's orchestrating
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.640]   all these things.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.520]   But I also can't help but wonder the fact that he is the most helpless probably, among
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.520]   all of them.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.520]   Soldiers, right?
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.520]   Soldiers.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:44.160]   Here he goes after one of the most non-threatening individuals, a slave.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:49.560]   The sad thing about all this is that he wasn't even able to make the kill.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:54.800]   Some of you guys might think Peter intentionally went after the ear, but nobody fights like
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:55.800]   that.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.800]   Right?
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:01.760]   Nobody's like, "Oh my goodness, I got to get him in the lobe, hit him where it hurts."
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.760]   He was going for the head.
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.760]   He was going for the kill.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.720]   You know, it was the kill shot, the kill swing.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.760]   And he just missed and he just hit the ear.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.760]   He cut the ear off.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.960]   It was a pathetic first move.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.840]   I mean, his attack would not have instilled any form of confidence in anybody.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.160]   And if I was again the disciples, I'd be like, "Oh my goodness, we're all dead.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.720]   What's this guy doing?"
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:28.520]   But to make matters worse, after Peter just slices off that ear, he hears a biting rebuke
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.520]   from the Lord.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:35.320]   Verse 52, "Then Jesus said to him, 'Put your sword back into its place, for all who have
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.160]   taken the sword will perish by the sword.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.320]   Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father and He will at once send me more than 12 legions
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.320]   of angels?'"
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.280]   The Lord didn't need Peter.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.760]   He didn't need his protection.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.760]   He didn't need his blade.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.800]   But with a single word, Jesus Christ can summon 12 legions of angels.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.840]   That is 72,000 angels, right?
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.240]   Warriors able to decimate the world a thousand times over.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.400]   Jesus didn't need a fisherman to fight for him.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.080]   The purpose of this wasn't to survive.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.080]   The purpose wasn't to live.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.960]   The purpose was to die.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.960]   The purpose was to redeem.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.200]   And Peter had to get that through his thick skull because he was still setting his mind
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.240]   on the things of man, not the things of God.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:17.680]   The cup of wrath was filled and Jesus Christ was prepared to drink.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.640]   There before Peter's eyes, he saw the great powerful shepherd give himself over to the
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.880]   soldiers willingly like a sheep to be slaughtered.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:31.760]   And it must have been an utterly confusing wave of emotions felt by Peter.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:36.240]   Intimidation as he stood before a cohort of Roman soldiers, unrelenting drive as he lunged
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.160]   forward to protect the one that he loved, demoralizing shame at the rebuke of the voice
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:46.560]   of his king and confusion as he sees Jesus Christ willingly give up his life to be killed.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.600]   And it became fearfully apparent to Peter it wasn't a matter of him fighting for Jesus.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.560]   It wasn't a matter of him killing for Jesus.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.920]   It was a matter of him being tortured and murdered with Jesus.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.360]   It was a matter of him laying down his life for Jesus.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.760]   Immediately his strength left him.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.920]   Disciples running for their lives and he knew if he stayed he'd be the only one left.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.920]   Fear overtook him.
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.920]   Terror seized his heart.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:13.200]   And at that moment he ran away with the rest, forsaking and abandoning the life of Jesus
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.280]   Christ to save his own.
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:24.600]   And so we behold the great resolve of the apostle Peter.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:31.680]   As Jesus was being led away, Peter followed behind from a distance, possibly in shame,
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.320]   definitely because of fear.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.800]   And we come to our text in verse 54.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:45.840]   Then they seized him, led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.160]   And Peter was following at a distance.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.040]   And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.600]   sat down among them.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.960]   Like a wounded dog, the apostle lived in search of his master.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.240]   Jesus was going to be judged by the religious leaders and at least Peter could be there
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.240]   when it happened.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.080]   And he came to the courtyard of the high priest and he waited there.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.480]   And the book of John tells us that he waited by the door and an unnamed disciple snuck
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:13.560]   Peter into the courtyard where he hid among the company of servants and soldiers.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:20.320]   But then in verse 56, and a serving girl seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.600]   at him, said, "This man also was with him."
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:28.440]   As Peter waited by the fire, a serving girl recognized Peter, literally a slave, a slave.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:33.600]   And the text says that she looked closely, she looked closely, she was staring at him.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.440]   She's staring at the man, she was looking intently into him.
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.760]   As the light of fire gave form to the features of his face, she realized he was one of the
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.760]   twelve.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.280]   And she told those around him, "This man also was with him."
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.160]   At that moment, dread overcame Peter and he denied the allegation.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.960]   And it says in verse 57, "But he denied it, saying, 'Woman, I do not know him.'"
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.560]   In the face of a slave girl, see that?
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:00.440]   In the face of a slave girl, not a soldier, not a politician, not a religious leader,
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.360]   but in front of a slave, Peter is unable to stand his ground and cling to his loyalty
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.360]   to Christ.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.600]   This man trembles with fear so that without hesitation, without any indication of vacillation,
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.200]   he just drops the name of the Lord in order to save his own neck.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.960]   His cowardice displayed here is no different from the cowardice that he displayed in the
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.960]   garden.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:22.440]   In fact, this is more pathetic because in the garden, at least it was before soldiers.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:26.480]   Peter was before a female slave.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.320]   This mild encounter is enough to push him back so that he made his way from the fire
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:35.080]   to the gateway according to the book of Mark.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:41.680]   But then in verse 58, "And a little later, someone else saw him and said, 'You also are
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.680]   one of them.'
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:46.440]   But Peter said, 'Man, I am not.'"
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.360]   Once again, another charge is brought up against Peter.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.920]   Luke tells us that this time it was a man.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.920]   A man made the accusation.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.760]   Someone undoubtedly more important than a slave girl.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.760]   But he wasn't alone.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:00.480]   In the book of John, we're told that he was with a group of men, officers and servants.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.240]   The man plainly goes up to Peter and says, "You also are one of them."
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.760]   And again, Peter denies it directly.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.520]   He says, "Man, I am not."
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.480]   So the pressure was building up.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.680]   The plan was falling apart.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.680]   Peter was falling apart.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.120]   All he wanted to do was follow the Lord Jesus Christ incognito.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.520]   He just wanted to stay under the radar.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:22.280]   The circumstances were pushing him to choose one or the other, to be with the Lord and
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.920]   die or to deny Him and live.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.960]   And he was choosing the latter.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:35.920]   Verse 59, "And after an interval of about an hour, still another insisted, saying, 'Certainly
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.600]   this man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean.'"
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:44.120]   After the second charge, there was a hiatus from the prime words of those in the courtyard.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:51.240]   Peter even believed that the worst was done, that he was in the clear.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.400]   But after an hour, another man approached him, but this time the words were more condemning
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.280]   because he spoke without any doubt.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.520]   He came to Peter and he says, "Certainly, certainly this man was with him.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.320]   There was no question about it."
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:09.640]   And then there was a charge that came with the circumstantial evidence, "For he too was
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.160]   a Galilean."
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:15.240]   Just like Jesus, he's from the region of Galilee because his accent gives it away.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.360]   And what would a Galilean be doing at this hour, on that night, in that place, in the
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.560]   courtyard of the high priest unless he was one of them, unless he was with him?
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.680]   And the one who brought the accusation according to the book of John was no other than the
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.720]   relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.560]   The charge was damning.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.200]   And he was pushed to a corner and he couldn't escape.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.840]   So Peter, he pushed back as hard as he could.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.560]   And then he says in verse 16, "Peter said, 'Man, I do not know what you are talking about.'"
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.640]   But he didn't simply deny Christ.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.000]   In Matthew chapter 26 verse 74, it says, "Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.920]   to swear, 'I do not know him.'"
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.080]   Peter brought forth the denial that the Jews themselves cannot easily dismiss because he
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.680]   called upon the name of the Lord to invoke a curse upon himself, right?
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.640]   That God would be witness to the truth.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.800]   That God himself would unleash from heaven his own retribution for anything but the truth.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.560]   Any foolish and flippant and self-serving Jew would be so reckless to use the sacred
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:13.560]   name of God for his own purposes and jeopardize his own soul in the process.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.200]   But at that moment, Peter wasn't thinking about the sanctity of the name of God.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.400]   He was thinking about his own survival.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:24.960]   So he had no problem using the name of Yahweh to deny the name of Jesus.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:32.000]   Turning the names of the Trinity against each other was a disgusting act of perversity.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.160]   Peter was taken to the hospital for a 6-day immediately while he was still speaking the
[00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.160]   rooster crowed.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.160]   The Lord turned and looked at Peter.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.880]   Peter remembered the saying of the Lord how he had said to him, "Before the rooster crows
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.800]   today, you will deny me three times."
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:51.600]   His words of denials were being uttered from the lips of Peter, a rooster crowed at that
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.760]   odd hour of the night.
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:59.520]   Before the unsuspecting crowd, it was definitely strange, but not something of which to be
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.520]   concerned.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.800]   As the ears of Peter, that crow blared like a siren of betrayal.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.840]   Because by the providence, a momentary window was opened for him to look at the Lord Jesus
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:09.840]   Christ.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.720]   He saw Christ while he was making that denial.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:18.160]   As he peered upon the face of his Savior, he saw the eyes of Jesus Christ looking back
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.840]   at him, eyes that knew exactly what had happened.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.640]   And there, when he saw the Lord Jesus looking back at him, he remembered his words, "Before
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.640]   the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:36.840]   You deny that you ever knew me, deny that you ever believed in me, deny that you ever
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.200]   loved me."
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:47.320]   At that moment, Peter came face to face with who he was, a sinner, a failure, a coward,
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.720]   a traitor.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:55.360]   Verse 62, "And he went out and wept bitterly.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:06.200]   And so we behold the unwavering bravery and the steadfastness of the great apostle Peter."
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.200]   And that's it.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.080]   That's the story of Peter.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.480]   From here on out, we don't hear from the guy.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.440]   We don't hear from him in the events of Jesus' death.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.720]   No sign of him during the judgment before Pilate.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.560]   No sign of him during the scourging.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.080]   No sign of him as the cross was being carried to Calvary.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.040]   No sign of him when Jesus was murdered on the cross.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.880]   No sign of him when he was buried.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.840]   There was no sign of Peter.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.000]   It's almost as if this guy who tried to save his life, did everything that he could to
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   save his life.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.280]   It was almost as if he was dead.
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:40.120]   The story of Peter is a story of failure.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.960]   The thing about all this is that Jesus knew about it.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.640]   He knew that Peter was going to plead ignorance.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.440]   He knew that Peter was going to reject him.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.320]   Before the rooster crows, you shall deny me three times.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.840]   Jesus knew of the inevitability of Peter's failure.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:58.640]   The staggering part of the story is that Jesus went to the cross anyways.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.520]   But then, that was the point, right?
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.200]   Because there he would bear the arrogance of Peter.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.080]   There he would bear the self-centered cowardice of Peter.
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.640]   There he would bear the disbelief of Peter.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.520]   There he would bear the denial of Peter.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.480]   There he would die for Peter on his behalf because of love.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.480]   That was the point.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.800]   Ironically, in trying to prevent the death of Jesus, Peter further propelled the need
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:22.800]   for it.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:30.680]   You see, when Jesus went to Calvary, it wasn't because we were somehow worthy of it.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.680]   You understand?
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:36.000]   He never lifted up his hands to be pierced because we were faithful.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.040]   He never offered his head to be crowned with thorns because we were worthy and we deserved
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.040]   it.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.040]   He never suffered the wrath of God because we lived a life of righteousness.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.560]   The reason why he went to the cross is because we deserve to be damned.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.720]   The reason why he went to the cross is because we violated the law of God.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.280]   The reason why he went to the cross is because we denied him.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.800]   Not three times and not three thousand times, but with every waking moment of our lives,
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.960]   we lived in defiance against the King of Kings, doing whatever was right in our own eyes.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:04.320]   Worthy of Calvary, we were worthy of damnation in hell.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.640]   Even knowing of our failures, Jesus Christ went to the cross anyways.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:14.320]   The failure of Peter was a sign of salvation, a sign to the salvation of Jesus Christ.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:21.120]   It is there where we behold the greatness of our God.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:27.280]   I know that there are some of you who are visiting me today.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:31.520]   Some of you might think you can only come before the Lord.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.840]   You can only come before the Lord if you clean up your act.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.200]   You can only come before God once you get your life straight, once you become that good
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.160]   Sunday going Christian.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.360]   It may be because you fall short of what you expect to stand.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:50.800]   The standard for a Christian should be that you shy away from the people of God, that
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.680]   you stay away from God and his church.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.720]   It might be for that reason why you only come on special occasions like tonight.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.920]   Stand back because of the shame and the guilt of the past.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.040]   Maybe stand back because you never feel good enough.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:09.800]   But the message of the gospel says that God will accept you, not because of your goodness.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.360]   He will accept you in spite of it.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.040]   Because there is nothing that you can ever do that will ever be good enough in the eyes
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.040]   of God.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:23.320]   Romans chapter 3 verse 10-12 it says that as it is written, none is righteous, no not
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.320]   one.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.520]   No one understands, no one seeks for God.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.360]   All have turned aside, together they have become worthless.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.040]   No one does good, not even one.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.560]   No matter how good anyone tries to be, he will never be good enough before the eyes
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.480]   of the Lord because the standard to be accepted by God is perfection.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.040]   You understand?
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:42.120]   The standard to be accepted by God is perfection.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:47.280]   It's an impossible standard even for the most moral and righteous sage or guru or saint.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:51.280]   The reason why we cannot attain perfection is because there is something wrong in our
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.280]   souls.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.880]   There is something twisted inside of us.
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:59.760]   Romans chapter 8 verse 7-8 it says for the mind that is set on flesh is hostile to God.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.460]   For it does not submit to God's law, indeed it cannot.
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:05.320]   Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.420]   We are a people who cannot help but sin against God.
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.860]   We cannot help but sin against God.
[00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.160]   We cannot obey the law of God.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.360]   We cannot please God.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.400]   Just like any broken thing that needs to be thrown into the trash, we deserve to be thrown
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.400]   into hell.
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.280]   It is for that very reason that Jesus Christ came into this world.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:25.040]   Not because we were good, not because we were whole, but because we were broken.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.480]   It is for that reason why Jesus Christ came into this world and took upon himself your
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.880]   sins, your transgressions, all the things that you have thought wrong, all the things
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:35.000]   that you have done wrong, all the things that you have felt wrong.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.680]   The things that you don't share with other people because of the shame that comes with
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.680]   it.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.680]   The guilt that you carry.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:45.120]   He has come into this world to bear your transgressions upon himself so that upon that cross he might
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.720]   die the death that you should have died so he might suffer the damnation that you should
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.800]   have suffered.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.120]   Jesus Christ died for you.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.320]   For God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:03.640]   So whosoever believes shall not perish but have eternal life.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:08.760]   Even though he knew you would fail, even though he knew you would backslide, even though he
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:14.400]   knew you would forget, even though he knew you would deny him, he went to die on the
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:21.000]   cross for us because of love.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.960]   Apart from Christ, every sin we committed, no matter what we may have professed, was
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.600]   a denial of him and his laws.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:33.400]   Denial of purity, betrayed by the indulgence of lust.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.960]   The resolve of selflessness, forgotten by the inflated mind.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.000]   The promise of love murdered by hate.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.040]   The claim of loyalty, a loyalty even unto death, swallowed up by cowardice.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.480]   By our own strength we were helpless.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.760]   We didn't deny the Lord three times.
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.360]   We lived a life of denial.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:54.480]   Yet Jesus Christ went to the cross anyways.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:58.400]   See, that's the gospel.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.360]   And that's why we're here today, right?
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.360]   Worship our God.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.000]   So all of us here have come to trust the message by faith.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.240]   May we remember the magnitude of what God has done for us.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.440]   Remember his sacrifice.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:18.680]   As we eat of the bread that represents the body that has taken upon itself our sins,
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:22.400]   as we drink the cup that represents the blood that ratified the new covenant by which we
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:26.520]   were saved, may we do so worshipfully.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:30.840]   May we do so with love.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:35.080]   Now we have denied our Christ, but he has not denied us.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.760]   John chapter 21, verse 15 to 17.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:44.520]   When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.760]   love me more than these?"
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.080]   And he said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know I love you."
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.240]   He said to him, "Feed my lambs."
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.960]   He said to him a second time, "Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?"
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:58.280]   And he said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know I love you."
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.280]   He said to him, "Tend my sheep."
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:05.560]   He said to him a third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.200]   Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?"
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.760]   He said to him, "Lord, you know everything.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:12.760]   You know that I love you."
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:17.400]   Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep."
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.200]   Three times Peter denied the Lord.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.840]   Now three times the Lord restores him.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.840]   The story of Peter is not a story of a man's greatness.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:27.720]   It's the story of the greatness of our God.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:32.960]   Let us direct our eyes away from ourselves and let us direct them to the cross.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:39.960]   Join me in prayer.
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:52.560]   Lord Jesus, when we read about the life of Peter, I know for many of us, we cannot help
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.920]   but see ourselves in him.
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:35:01.560]   Fresh, foolish, proud, arrogant.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:07.880]   And just like him, we have failed.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.240]   You know the number of times in which we have said we will follow.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:15.040]   You know the number of times in which you heard us say that we will never fall, we'll
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:20.320]   try our best only to fall again and to fail you again and again.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:24.240]   But we praise you and we worship you God because you don't accept us because of our
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.240]   righteousness.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.240]   You don't accept us because of our goodness.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.360]   You accept us because you have forgiven us.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:34.160]   You accepted us because you are good.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.640]   You accept us because of who you are.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.760]   So Lord, we praise you and we want to profess our love to you.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:50.680]   And as we come before the table and as we eat the bread and drink the cup, may we remember
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:57.400]   that the story of Calvary is not just some kind of cold theological philosophical study,
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:02.360]   but it is something personal to us that you came down and died for our soul.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:07.760]   That we might be spared from hell and be taken up to heaven to live with you forever.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:11.880]   Until that day comes, we know that you are with us and that you have given us new life.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.600]   Holy Spirit, you are with us.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.080]   God, we thank you for this night and time of worship.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.080]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:17.080]   Amen.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:17.880]   Thank you.
