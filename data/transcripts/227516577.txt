[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   forgiveness of our trespasses.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   When the Bible talks about a redemption, it typically personifies power, like I said.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   It personifies the power of sin from whom we have been redeemed.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Sin is our slave master.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   But not only does he personify sin, he talks about the sin that comes from us,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   the wrong and the offenses that we personally commit, the vomit that we throw up.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Even though we have been manipulated, deceived, and oppressed by the power of sin to violate the laws of God,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   we are not exempt from the guilt of our crimes. We still merit judgment.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Because of sin, we sin. But because we sinned, we deserve to be damned.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   But just as the Lord saved us from the sin that is over us, God saves us from the sin that comes from us.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   When the Lord Jesus Christ offered himself as the price for our redemption, he took upon himself our iniquities.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   He suffered the wrath of God and died a death that we deserve.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   And there is nothing, there is nothing on this earth and there is nothing in hell that can condemn us.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Because at the end of the day, God is the one who justifies. Christ is the one who died for us.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   All the powers of hell can bring their case to the courts of heaven above.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And they can contest our pardon, but they will never be able to condemn because Christ is the one who died.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Spurgeon says this, "Luther tells us of the devil appearing to him in a dream and bringing before him the long rolls of sins."
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   And when he brought them, Luther said, "Now right at the bottom, the blood of Jesus Christ, God's Son, cleanses us from all sin."
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Oh, that blessed word, "all."
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   From all sin, great sin and little sin, sins of our youth and sins of our gray hair, sins by night and sins by day, sins of actions, sins of thought,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   all God, blessed Savior, precious blood, omnipotent redeemer, mighty Red Sea that drowns every Egyptian.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   We are forgiven from our sins because he was damned for all our sins.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   It is in him that we have the forgiveness of trespasses.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   That is God's plan for your salvation.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And it's a joyous truth, something in which we exult.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   But like I said, it goes beyond you.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   God's plan extends beyond you, regardless of how important and precious you are before the eyes of our Savior.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   The plan goes beyond you.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   And so we come to the ultimate plan to unite all things in Christ.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   The ultimate plan to unite all things in Christ, Ephesians chapter 1, verse 8 through 10.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Let's look at the text.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Ephesians chapter 1, verse 8 through 10.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Which he lavished on us in all wisdom and insight, making known to us the mystery of his will according to his purpose,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time to unite all things in him,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   things in heaven and things on earth.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I'm going to read it again.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Let's read it carefully one more time.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Which he lavished on us in all wisdom and insight, making known to us the mystery of his will according to his purpose,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   which he set forth in Christ.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Now listen to the plan.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Listen to that mysterious purpose.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Verse 10.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   As a plan for the fullness of time to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   What is absolutely staggering about verse 7, when we read verse 7, what's staggering is that that's just a part of a larger purpose.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I want you to try to think and wrap your mind around that truth.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Everything that I just talked about in the last point, that's just part of a purpose, a larger purpose.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   So the spiritual incarceration of the soul, the global and generational tyranny of sin,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   the incarnation of the son, the imputation of sin, the eternal outpouring of wrath,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   the crucifixion of the Christ, the pain inflicted against the impervious God,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   the personal deliverance of the soul, and the application of forgiveness for each and every one of you,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   is not all there is.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   All of that, that's not everything.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Each one of these realities is overwhelmingly titanic.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   It's immense.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And then to experience all of them together is incomparable and unmatched by any power.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   It literally breathes life into death.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   But here the apostle Paul says that's only part of the plan.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   He's telling us that there's a greater overarching purpose,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   a goal that extends beyond you, a goal that is higher, that is transcendently higher than you.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   As colossal as your redemption and your forgiveness of sins may be,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   it is not the end, it is a means to an end.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   It is a means to an end.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And the Lord has lavished His grace upon us to have wisdom and insight,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   to know this mystery, this greater mystery,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   and to know the purpose that He has set forth for us.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   And to know the purpose that He has set forth in Christ.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And the purpose He reveals in verse 9, that at the fullness of time,
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   He will unite all things in heaven and on earth.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And so let us take the wisdom that God has given to us and really understand His divine will.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Now, this is, this is super cool.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   I think it's really, really, I mean it's fascinating, but it really is amazing.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   When you first hear the term "uniting things in heaven and on earth," it sounds kind of cryptic.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   What in the world does that mean?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Uniting things in heaven and the things on earth.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   It sounds really cryptic.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   But there's an aspect to it which is very straightforward and simple.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   What does it mean?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   It just means that God is going to unite all things in heaven and on earth.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   He pretty much can do anything and everything.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   So He's going to unite everything in heaven and on earth.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Now, we believe in, from a naturalistic perspective, we believe in pretty crazy stuff.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Right?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   We believe in, one of the things we believe in is two worlds.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   We believe in two worlds.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   We believe in a visible world and an invisible world.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   We believe in a seen realm and an unseen realm.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   We believe in earth and we believe in heaven.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And we believe in two different realms of existence.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   We exist in this realm.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Right?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   That's what we believe.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Now, what's interesting is that the Bible talks about a place where these two realms touch.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   It talks about a realm where--it talks about a reality where these two worlds, these two places of existence coalesce.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And the point of interaction is what we call the temple of God.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   It's the temple of God.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   You guys watch the show Flash on Netflix?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I don't know if you guys watch it.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Okay, Lucy and I were kind of watching that.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   And there's season--oh, yeah, someone's excited.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   All right.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I love DC.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   I love Marvel kind of stuff.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   But there's a season--you know what I'm talking about--in season two where Flash travels to another earth, earth two, as opposed to his earth, earth one.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   And there's multiple worlds in a multiverse.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And he travels to the second earth through an interdimensional portal.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Now, any of you guys who are familiar with sci-fi, this shouldn't be unfamiliar.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   It shouldn't be foreign to you.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   It might be we might have this idea of going from one universe to another universe or spiritual world to a material world, a muggle world to a magical one.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   You could go from one world to another.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   And the way in which you go from one place to another is through a place where these two worlds coincide, where these two worlds touch at a certain spatial point, a portal or interdimensional portal.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   When the Bible talks about how heaven and earth touch, it touches.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   And it touches at the temple of Jerusalem.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   And you have to begin to think in this way.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   It touches at the temple of Jerusalem.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   It's almost like a portal.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   It's a place where God comes down into this world and he manifests his presence in a very unique way.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And so within the temple, there is a place called the Holy of Holies that is designed to look like the throne room of God.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I don't know if you guys realize that.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   When you read the Old Testament and you read about the temple, you read about the Holy Holies, it is actually designed to look like the throne room of God.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   And within the Holy of Holies, there is the Ark of the Covenant, which is a box made out of acacia wood covered in gold.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   And within it contains the Ten Commandments of God.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   And the Ark of the Covenant is considered to be the footstool of God.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   1 Chronicles 28, verse 2 says this.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   "Then King David rose to his feet and said, 'Hear me, my brothers and my people.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I had it in my heart to build a house of rest for the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and for the footstool of our God.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   And I made preparations for building and for the footstool of our God.'"
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Now as unique and intriguing and attractive as this might be, the temporary and limited union between heaven and earth on the temple grounds is not a place where humanity can easily enter.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   It was a place where men trembled to go.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Leviticus chapter 10, verse 1 through 2 says this.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   "Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took a censer and put fire in it and laid incense on it and offered unauthorized fire before the Lord, which He had not commanded them.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   The fire came out from before the Lord and consumed them, and they died before the Lord."
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Because these men did not treat God as holy, they were consumed.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   They were judged for their offenses, even though they were priests.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Listen to 1 Samuel chapter 6, verse 19.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   "And He struck," that is God, "God struck some of the men of Beth-shemesh because they looked upon the Ark of the Lord.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   He struck 50,070 of them, and the people mourned because the Lord had struck the people with a great blow."
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Do you guys know that story?
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Do you guys remember when the Ark of the Covenant was stolen by the Philistines?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   So they basically took the Ark of the Covenant, and they thought they were victorious over Yahweh and the nation of Israel.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   And because of that, what ended up happening? They started getting tumors.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   They started getting tumors, and they passed it off from one Philistine city to the next, one Philistine city to the next, because everybody started getting tumors.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And they're like, "Oh my goodness, we're all dying."
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And so they took the Ark of the Covenant and sent it back to the nation of Israel.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   And so when the nation of Israel saw that the Ark of the Covenant was coming back to them, they were all excited.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   And so, I don't know, they went to make sure that it had everything within it.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   When they opened it up, 50,000 of them died.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Understand? Can you imagine how scary that is?
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   If I was there, I would be like, "Oh my, yes, it's all there. It's all there, guys. All the articles."
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   It is absolutely staggering how holy God is.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   The presence of God, listen, the presence of God meant death for the sinner.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   The presence of God meant death for the sinner.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   The coming of heaven meant judgment for this earth.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   I want you to begin to piece together the problem that we have.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   The temple of God, as glorious and beautiful as it is, is a dangerous place to be.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   The profane would be consumed by the fire of holiness, and the darkness would be scattered before the light of glory.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And the sin would be judged by the retribution of the righteous.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Now this is enough to deter humanity from entering into the temple of God, regardless of how holy and beautiful it might be.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   The place where heaven and earth touch, as attractive and glorious and awesome as that might be,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   is not a place unto which humanity can easily enter.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   So when I think about this, I'm like, "Oh, okay. As cool as that is, man, let things be in the Middle East.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Let the temple grounds be what it is. I don't want to visit it. I don't want to die."
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   But there's a problem. You guys have to realize that there's a problem.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   The scriptures reveal that the divine, the divine and the earthly will one day coalesce fully.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   There's a point in which it touches, but there will be a day when this world and this world will coalesce fully.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Now there's a problem there, because when the heavenly and the earthly come together, what happens to those who are upon earth?
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   They will die. You understand that? That's the problem. That's the problem.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   The manifestation of heaven in the temple grounds will one day cover the entire face of this earth.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   And all the things above and the things below will be united in the person of Christ,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   a union that will result in the imminent death of sinners.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Revelation chapter 21 verse 8, it says, "But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   In that day, sinful humanity will be killed and cast into hell to suffer the second death."
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   It's for this reason that the Son of God came down to liberate us from our enslavement to sin
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   and to deliver us and to save us from our trespasses.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   It says, "Only through our Lord Jesus Christ, only through His blood could we ever be cleansed
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   from the filth of our trespasses, that we might not defile the holy, that we might not obscure the glory,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   that we might not violate the righteousness, and then die before the presence of God
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   when the things of heaven descend upon the things of on this earth."
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   The death of Jesus Christ is essentially there to prepare us for the union of all things.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Does that make sense? Yes? Yes? It makes sense.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   The death of Jesus Christ is to prepare us for the union of all things.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   The only chance in the hope of survival when heaven and earth, it touches,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   or it has touched before in the Old Testament,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   the day in which that point of coalition becomes one,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   in that day, sinful humanity will be damned.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Again, it's not just about us. It's about things much bigger than us.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Not only must humanity be purged from the corruption of sin,
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   but creation itself needs to be ready for the union of all things.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Why? Because creation itself was corrupted by the sin of Adam.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   The Bible speaks of the day when heaven and earth will be brought to nothing.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   When it talks about heaven and earth together, it's talking about heaven being the skies,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   the firmament, not the unseen realm.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   There will be a day when the heaven and the earth will be brought to nothing.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   It will not be destroyed by water this time around. It will be destroyed by fire.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Just as our sins were incinerated upon the cross through the flames of God's wrath,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   so this world must be purged by fire.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   2 Peter 3, verse 10, it says, "But the day of the Lord will come like a thief,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   and then the heavens will pass away with a roar,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed."
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Everything is going to burn. Everything is going to be purged.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   The skies and the earth, along with everything in it, will be brought to nothing.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   And by the divine word of God, just as he spoke the world into existence,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   he will speak the world into existence one more time,
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   and a second heaven and a second earth will be created.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   A new firmament and a new earth will be made.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   A world no longer infected by the sin of Adam.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   A world no longer enslaved to sin.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   A world of perfection and a world of purity.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   It will be a world that is now fit to receive unto itself heaven.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Take your Bibles and turn with me to Revelation chapter 21.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Revelation chapter 21.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Let's read verse 1 to verse 4.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   "Then I saw a new heaven," right?
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   A new heaven, that is a new firmament, "and a new earth.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   For the first heaven and the first earth had passed away,
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   and the sea was no more.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   'Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   He will dwell with him, and they will be his people,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   and God himself will be with them as their God.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   He will wipe away every tear from their eyes,
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   and death shall be no more,
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   neither shall there be any mourning, nor crying, nor pain any more,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   for the former things have passed away.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   The holy city, carved out by the hand of God, will descend from the clouds,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   and it will rest upon a new earth where the people of God will dwell.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   And in that day, when heaven comes upon this earth,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   when all things unite, there will be no need for a temple."
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Why? Because a temple is the manifestation of God's presence.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   But in that day, God will dwell among man.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   "God, who manifested himself within the holy of holies,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   the footstool of his throne, will now emanate his glory from the seat of his throne."
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Revelation chapter 21, verse 22 to 26, it says,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   "And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God, the Almighty and the Lamb.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   And its gates will never shut by day, and there will be no night there.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Before the union of all things, God manifested his glory from the seat of his throne.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   But in the day when all things unite, God will manifest his glory,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   not from his footstool, but from his seat.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   And that day all people, redeemed of God and forgiven of their grace, will worship Yahweh.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   They will join the angels in praise. The kings will lay down their crowns.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   The seraphim will sing songs of joy. Nations will shout in triumph.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   The sons of God will herald the good works of God.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   All heaven and earth will worship and exalt Yahweh, the Son of God."
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   See, the incarnation of the Son, the imputation of sin, the eternal outpouring of wrath,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   the crucifixion of the Christ, the personal deliverance of the soul,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   the application of forgiveness, do not only work for the redemption of the elect,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   but they come together with the destruction of the old world, the creation of the new heavens and the new earth,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   the descent of the new Jerusalem, and the dwelling of God among men,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   so that all the world might exalt and worship the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   the one who sits at the center of this cosmic union.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   That is the point of our salvation. That is the point. That is the ultimate end.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   It's not you. It's God.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   We will all exalt and worship God.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   And you're not going to be thinking about yourself mainly,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   but you're going to be looking upon God and worshiping Him, thinking about Him mainly.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Philippians 2, 9-11, "Therefore God has highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name that is above every name,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father."
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Romans 11, 36, "For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   To Him be the glory forever. Amen."
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Now what the Bible teaches is that until the Lord unites the things in heaven and earth,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   we Christians, we live in between these two worlds.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   I hope you understand that. We live in between two worlds.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   We physically exist in this material world, this earth,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   but our spirits belong to God in heaven.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   The Apostle Paul develops this mysterious dynamic.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Take your Bibles and turn with me to Ephesians chapter 4.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Ephesians chapter 4.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Ephesians chapter 2, verse 4-7.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   "But God, being rich in mercy because of the great love with which He loved us,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   By grace you have been saved and raised us up with Him
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   so that in the coming ages He might show the immeasurable riches of His grace
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   and kindness toward us in Christ Jesus."
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Spiritually speaking, we are already with the Lord in heaven.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   But not only are we up there with Him, but He is down here with us.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   We are up there with Him, but He is also down here with us.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Remember, the temple of God was where God manifested His presence.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   It was where heaven touched earth.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   And so the Holy of Holies was designed to be the throne room of God.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   The temple of God was where God manifested His presence.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   It was the structure within which heaven and earth coalesced.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Now listen to what the Apostle Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6.19.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Listen to this.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   1 Corinthians 6.19, "Or do you not know that your body, that your body
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God?
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   You are not your own."
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   The Bible teaches that we are the temple of God, that God dwells within us.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Heaven comes upon this earth. Heaven touches this earth.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Listen, "Through each and every one of you who believe in the gospel of Jesus."
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   We are a people, therefore, who are in between two worlds.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   And it's for this reason why Jesus Christ says, "You are in this world,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   but you are not of this world."
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Now the practical implications of this is massive.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Remember, orthodoxy precedes orthopraxy.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Understanding this truth should affect the way that you live.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   First causing you to marvel and stand in awe of what has just happened in the cross.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   But then working that out in your life.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   The practical implications of this is that you channel the blessings of heaven
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   unto this earth. Do you know that?
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   You channel the blessings of heaven to this earth.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   You can impart love from above to those who are here below.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   You can proclaim the truth that proceeds from the lips of God.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   You can shine the light of the glory of the divine essence
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   in a world where people are stumbling in the dark.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   You can channel the breath of life to those who are dead.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   You can bring the things that are in heaven unto those who are upon this earth.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   Why? Because God dwells within you.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Because heaven coalesces and touches earth through you,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   for you are the temple of God.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   You can proclaim the gospel and direct the love, the truth, and the light
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   and the life of heaven to the people in this world.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   In fact, you must. You must.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   You must proclaim and deliver that which is in heaven
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   to those who reside upon this earth because there is nothing else in heaven
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   that functions as this conduit, as this channel.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   The elect of God, those who have been predestined before the foundation of this world,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   has been chosen for this task.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   As you guys go out into this world and you proclaim the gospel
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   and you give to your fellow man the things that God has given to us,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   you have it. You proceed with the help of the triune God.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   You have access to the omnipotent.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   You have the wisdom of the omniscient because he who created the heavens and the earth
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   dwells within you. You have the blessings of the Father.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   You have the life of the Son. You have the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   the indwelling of the Spirit.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   So even if the gates of Hades come against you,
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   you will prevail as you win one soul at a time to build the kingdom of God.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Wherever you go as a heavenly conduit of truth and life,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   the triune God is with you even to the end of this world.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   And that is to strengthen you, strengthen you, to encourage you.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   One of my heroes is a man by the name of John G. Patton.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Have you guys heard about this guy, John G. Patton?
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   I say the G stands for gangster.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   He was a missionary, 1800s, who went to the New Hebrides Islands.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   The New Hebrides Islands were occupied by cannibals.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   It was occupied by cannibals.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   This guy went to evangelize and share the gospel with cannibals,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   people who tried to eat him.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   And the story is absolutely amazing.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   He wrote an autobiography about his life.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   And I want to read you a quote from him
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   just to show you how in tune he was with heaven.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   You know, Pastor Peter preached for us last week.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   Oh, man, it was a powerful message.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   And really trying to shake us up from our apathy.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   I think it was the same message that he delivered to you.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And so you guys know what I'm talking about.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   And I'm really thankful for your pastor because of his heart for you
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   and his heart for our church as well.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   That we don't become apathetic,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   that we don't become complacent in this world.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   We become enticed by the comforts and the securities
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   of what Southern California, Orange County has to offer.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   And I can see the burden upon his heart
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   and the way in which he exhorted us.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   And it's a heart that I want to have.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   It's a heart that I would hope all of you guys would strive for.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   And one of the things when you read about the men of the past
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   who have been faithful is that they really lived in between two worlds.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   And that is the way in which we need to live.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   Let me read for us this quote.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   It says this.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   This is John J. Patton.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   "But my enemies seldom slack in their hateful design against my life.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   However calm they're baffled for the moment,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   within a few days of the above events
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   when natives in large numbers were assembled at my house,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   a man furiously rushed on me with his axe.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   But a Casarumene chief snatched the spade with which I had been working
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   and dexterously defended me from instant death.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Life in such circumstances led me to cling very near to the Lord Jesus.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   I knew not for one brief hour when or how an attack might be made.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Yet with my trembling hand clasped in the hand once nailed on Calvary,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   and now swaying the scepter of the universe,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   calmness and peace and resignation abode in my soul.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Next day a wild chief followed me about for four hours with his loaded musket."
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   And so they traded with the white men, the natives here, so they had guns.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   "A wild chief followed me about four hours with his loaded musket.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   And though often directed toward me, God restrained his hand.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   I spoke kindly to him and attended to my work as if he had not been there,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   fully persuaded that my God had placed me there
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   and would protect me till my allotted task was finished.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Looking up in unceasing prayer to our dear Lord Jesus,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   I left all in his hand and felt immortal till my work was done.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Trials and hairbreadth escapes strengthened my faith
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   and seemed only to nerve me for more to follow.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   And they did tread swiftly upon each other's heels.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Without that abiding consciousness of the presence and the power of my dear Lord and Savior,
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   nothing else in all the world could have preserved me
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   from losing my reason and perishing miserably.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   His words, 'Alo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world,'
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   became to me so real that it would not have startled me to behold him,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   as Stephen did, gazing down upon the sea."
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   He was a man who kept one eye on heaven and one eye on earth.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   He sought to bring the message of life
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   to people who were literally steeped in death, murder, and cannibalism.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   And in so doing, he rested upon the sovereignty of God,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   the God who resided in heaven.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Every single Christian, every single Christian, lives in between two worlds
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   so that he has access to the blessings of one as he lives in the other.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   May you be a people who rest upon these blessings
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   as you channel truth and life to those who are perishing upon this earth.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Until the final day, when in the fullness of time,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   when God will unite all things in heaven and on earth,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   unto the praise of his name,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   may we be faithful in anticipation of that final day.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Let us pray.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:57.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
