[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.880]   I'm just gonna highlight certain issues here, okay?
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.120]   So again, as you're reading, you can just kind of follow through.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.800]   And then I'm gonna, the ones I'm not gonna explain, I'll just leave it up there, you
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.360]   can fill in the blanks.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.720]   And then the ones that I'm gonna highlight will take a few minutes to talk, okay?
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:33.080]   So if you look at chapter 48, it begins by saying, "Hear this, O house of Jacob, who
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.360]   are called by my name, by the name of Israel, and who came from the waters of Judah."
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.800]   And the first question I ask is, what does the name Jacob mean, and how does it relate
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.200]   to the indictment, not incitement, indictment God brings against them in verse 1?
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.440]   So what is the significance of him saying, "O house of Jacob, but you call yourself
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.000]   Israel," and then he says, "who came from the waters of Judah, who swear by the name
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.560]   of the Lord and confess God Israel, but not in truth or right."
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.600]   So anybody took some time to look into the meaning of Jacob and Israel, and what's the
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.800]   significance of what he's saying?
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.800]   Anybody?
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.240]   It kind of sets the tone for the rest of the chapter.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.040]   Anybody?
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.600]   Surplanter, slippery one, okay?
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.440]   And Israel?
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.840]   Israel was, God gave, God changed Jacob's name to Israel when he wrestled with God,
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.840]   right?
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.120]   So Israel means wrestles with God, right?
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:51.240]   So ah, okay, that's what that thing was.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.480]   No, no, it's not the battery.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.680]   It's the battery?
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.680]   Can you check to see if this is connected?
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:29.680]   Oh, it's working now?
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.680]   Okay.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.600]   Alright, so the name of it, he says, "the healer, the catcher of supplanted, the one
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.560]   who struggles with God," right?
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.360]   And then Israel prides itself of contending with God, in other words, they call themselves
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.000]   Israel, the ones who contend with God, but he says, "you're acting like Jacob," meaning
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.360]   before you met God and he was slippery, he's always cunning and trying to maneuver to get
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.360]   ahead, right?
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.040]   He's saying, "you call yourself to confess the God of Israel, but not in truth or right,"
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.040]   right?
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.200]   So what you call yourself and who you really are are different.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.040]   So he's calling them out for their hypocrisy, like, "you view yourself one way, but the
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.560]   truth is that you're acting more like Jacob than Israel," right?
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.600]   And so that's the tone that he sets, for they call themselves after the holy city, and they
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.320]   themselves on the God of Israel, the Lord of hosts of his name, and then basically saying,
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.600]   "that's what you think you are."
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.280]   Like, you're going back to your origin, saying, "oh, God is our God, you know, we have a covenant
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.080]   with this God, we're Israel, God favors us, but in reality you're acting more like your
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.080]   former self, Jacob."
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.720]   Okay?
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.960]   So again, the point of all of this is God's constantly reminding them, okay, chapter 8,
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.640]   the tone of chapter 8 is reminding them that even though that's how you view yourself,
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.320]   in reality you keep going away.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.160]   And so, but even in the context of that, he's saying, "even though that's who you are,"
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.680]   like he said, he's remaining faithful to himself, and then the promised Messiah, and then again
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:15.080]   he goes into details about this Messiah that's coming.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.440]   So what is the motivation that he says he's doing what he's doing?
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.960]   He says, "for his own namesake."
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.960]   For hisâ€¦
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:34.560]   Again, just let me take a minute to just emphasize here, when you first read or heard from a
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.000]   sermon or read in the Bible, it said, "God does this for his own glory, for my own glory
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.720]   I will not give to another," what was your first response to that?
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:50.920]   What was your honest response when you read or heard for the first time, "God does this
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.920]   for his own glory?"
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.920]   Huh?
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:00.520]   Okay, confusion, what does that mean?
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.520]   True gangster?
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.520]   Okay.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.520]   That's K-Town in there, right there.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:13.440]   Is that what you thought, Mitchell?
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.440]   Anything else?
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.440]   Egotistical?
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.680]   That's the first thing that I thought was like, "oh, he's seeking his own glory."
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.760]   Imagine somebody else saying, "I did it for me, for my own glory, I will not give my glory
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.760]   to another."
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.960]   So what does that mean?
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.720]   So I think a lot of people when they first hear that, they're like, "huh."
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.840]   I'm sure you've talked to a non-Christian or maybe a young Christian, they may have
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.000]   thought that.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.600]   So why is that important for us to recognize that God's seeking his own glory?
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.000]   If it's not negative, obviously he doesn't use it in a negative way, right?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.600]   How is that different than us saying, "I seek my own glory?"
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.600]   Deserving of it?
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.600]   He's the only one with the right to seek his own glory.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:10.600]   He's the spirit of all creation, whereas God is the creator and everything he sees is made
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.480]   for him.
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.480]   Okay.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.180]   Right, we are not like him.
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:23.520]   We can't, again, even the word glorify, like glorify to us means to exaggerate.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.560]   We take something and we exaggerate something, "oh, you're glorifying whatever it is."
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.240]   But to glorify God simply means to present him as he is, right?
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.560]   And no matter what we do, no matter what we say, we would never exaggerate who he is.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.680]   He can't be exaggerated.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.980]   He's the beginning and the end.
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.900]   Everything is made by him and for him, right?
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.240]   So when he says he seeks his own glory, you know when Jesus says that he has no one else
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:56.200]   to make a promise, you know, nothing greater to promise than himself, when he says God
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.260]   promises, right?
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.760]   God confirms himself, he confirms, right?
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.400]   In other words, there's nothing greater than him.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.800]   There's nothing above him that he can say, "I, you know, my promise or my conviction
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.620]   or covenant is based on anything else but him."
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.440]   So what does it mean for him to seek his glory?
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.640]   If life comes from him, if Zoe comes from him, if Sabbath comes from him, what does
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.880]   it mean to glorify himself, right?
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:36.360]   Life, rest, security, safety, love, all of that, when he is glorified, we are loved,
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.360]   right?
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.580]   Because everything flows from him.
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:44.940]   So when he is exalted, we live because we're connected to that, right?
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:50.560]   So he, who he is, is not based upon me or you, right?
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.200]   His grace and mercy is not based upon who you are, it's based upon who he is, first
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.700]   and foremost, right?
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:04.360]   So that's why his promises are sure, because his promises and his nature does not fluctuate
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.320]   based upon who we are.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.400]   Who he is, is he is, whatever we are, right?
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.720]   I don't know if, I hope that makes some sense, right?
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:19.260]   Because this is at the core of salvation, this is the core of human history, right?
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.460]   To glorify himself.
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:26.760]   So anytime we take what belongs to him and we step in those shoes, we mess everything
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.680]   up, right?
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.340]   When we are glorified, what happens?
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.340]   We die.
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.900]   Like, our sins are exposed, right?
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:43.580]   When he's glorified, we live, we're saved.
[00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.900]   He's the Alpha and Omega, he's the beginning and the end, right?
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.460]   Means he commands all things.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:59.860]   He says, he's saying this is the nation of Israel because he's prophesying to Israel
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.340]   that trials are going to come, the Babylonians are going to come, they're going to suppress
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:07.820]   you, the women are going to become widows, but in the end he says, "But I am the beginning
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.940]   and the end," right?
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.720]   He is the first and the last.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:16.280]   So he's trying to encourage them in the context of turmoil that he is still sovereign, right?
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.740]   Not only when the remnants return, but even in the context of turmoil, that God is the
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:27.780]   beginning and the end.
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:39.760]   And clearly, verse 14 and 15 is in reference to the Messiah that's coming, and the call
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.000]   is to assemble and to listen.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.800]   So you see that over and over again in chapter 48, 49, right?
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.520]   Verse 14, "Come and listen."
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.800]   16, "Draw near, listen."
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.840]   He says over and over again.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.000]   I have something very important to tell you.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.400]   So again, whenever Jesus says something that is very, very important, he says, "Verily,
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.560]   verily, I say to you," or he would repeat something, right?
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.640]   Here he's about to say something really important, so he says, "Gather, come along, listen carefully."
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:15.000]   And he's saying all of this is because he's preparing to get into the Messianic prophecies.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.480]   He's been talking about it, but he's going to go heavy into it, and he's going to go
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.480]   into it in much more detail.
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:24.480]   And that's going to lead us to chapter 53, okay?
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.960]   So he says, "Why do you need to obey?"
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.640]   All right, he's going to say, "Come, obey.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.120]   I'm going to teach you that obedience is profit.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.360]   It's going to lead to peace, and ultimately God's blessing."
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:59.320]   Again, I want to take a few minutes to look at chapter 49, this first section, and the
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.800]   rest of it we're going to go by pretty quick, okay?
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.760]   So if you look at chapter 49, he just called everybody, "Come and listen, come and listen.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.000]   I'm going to teach you something new that's going to happen," right?
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.680]   So over and over again at the end of chapter 48, he's gathering, "Listen, listen, listen.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.620]   Something new's going to happen, something new's going to happen."
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:24.080]   And then chapter 49, again, starts with, "Listen to me, O coastlands, and give attention, you
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.480]   peoples from afar.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.360]   The Lord called me from the womb, from the body of my mother.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.360]   He named my name."
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.360]   Who's he in reference to?
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.360]   Messiah, right?
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.160]   He's talking about Jesus.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:43.120]   So, right, he's talking about the coming Messiah.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:48.080]   What does he say about the coming Messiah?
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:54.160]   Verse 1.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:12:00.720]   So if this is about the Messiah, what is he saying about the Messiah?
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.320]   Huh?
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.880]   He's going to come as a baby, right?
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.200]   He's from the mother's womb, the body of my mother.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.880]   He named my name, right?
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.520]   Again, this is in reference to the Messiah being a human birth.
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.400]   Luke chapter 131 fulfills that.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.560]   And he also says in verse 4, right, he said, "And he said to me, 'You are my servant, Israel,
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.200]   in whom I will be glorified.'"
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.920]   Remember when Jesus is going to the cross, and he says, "It is time to glorify your son,
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.960]   and me to glorify you, Father," right?
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.960]   So again, these are very specific prophecies about Christ.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.280]   And if you look at verse 4, "But I said, 'I have labored in vain.'"
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.280]   Right?
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.920]   What is that?
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.000]   "I have labored in vain.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.440]   I have spent my strength for nothing in vanity."
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.280]   What happens at the end of his ministry?
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.520]   It wasn't just the leaders who rejected him, right?
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.040]   All of Israel rejected him.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.960]   And then it culminated of the leaders rejecting him.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:08.320]   So where does theâ€”and if you go to his ministry, like, you know, we always talk about Jesus
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.640]   discipling his disciples.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.240]   That's why he was there for three years, right?
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:20.200]   There's something more obvious than the discipling of the disciples what characterizes three
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.200]   years of ministry.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.560]   It was his rejection.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.640]   It was a systematic rejection of the Messiah.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.720]   Remember, at the beginning of his ministry, he goes to the temple, cleanses.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.280]   What's the first place he goes to?
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.080]   Anybody remember?
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:40.000]   When he comes to Jerusalem, he basically inaugurates his ministry after the baptism and after the
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.120]   wilderness.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:46.280]   He goes to Jerusalem, he cleanses the temple, and then he goes back, on the way back, right,
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.040]   he goes through Samaria, and then where does he go?
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.360]   When he goes back home, what's the first place he goes to?
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.000]   Anybody remember?
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.100]   His hometown, Nazareth.
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.260]   He goes back to hometown.
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:02.320]   What happens at his hometown?
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:08.800]   They try to throw him off a cliff, right, because he basically rebukes them, right?
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.640]   He said, "They're all praising him.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.240]   Oh, you know, hometown hero coming home."
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.000]   And then he says, "You know, you're just like your fathers," right?
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   And then they get angry.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.080]   "Oh, there you speak to us," and then they reject him.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:24.360]   And then after his rejection, he begins to that, what do you call it?
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:30.740]   The, not Trinity, the triangle, yes, evangelical triangle.
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.740]   What are the three cities?
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:39.940]   Chorazin, Poseidon, Capernaum, right?
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:43.900]   That those three cities are where he basically does majority of his ministry.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:50.060]   At the end of a year and a half to two years of ministry there, how does that end?
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.700]   The culmination happens at John chapter 6.
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.480]   What happens at John chapter 6?
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.480]   Huh?
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.480]   Right, feeding of the 5,000.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.220]   It begins with feeding of the 5,000.
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.680]   At the end of the chapter, they said they turn away from him.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.160]   They reject him, right?
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.720]   So there's a systematic rejection.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.840]   And then he gets into Jerusalem, and then he gets to Jerusalem second time.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.840]   What happens?
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.540]   Now the leaders are going to reject him.
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:18.840]   So if you look at the three years of ministry, it was rejection from home, rejection from
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.560]   the three cities that he spent most of the ministry, and then ultimately rejection from
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.240]   the leaders.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.960]   So why, if you were to look at it humanly speaking, his ministry was utter failure,
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:34.720]   because at the end of it, they crucified him, okay, humanly speaking, right?
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:42.320]   So remember we talked about Jesus came and basically he's turning off the light in Israel.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.400]   The sin may be utterly sinful.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.600]   What could be more sinful?
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.040]   What could Israel be more guilty of than anything else?
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.240]   It's like rejecting their own Messiah.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:57.480]   Not only do they not, you know, not only do they not obey the commandments, but remember
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.000]   Jesus gives a parable about the vineyard, and he sends his son, and says, "Hey, let's
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.440]   kill this son."
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.880]   And he gives that as an illustration.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:10.400]   So basically Israel's sin has reached its pinnacle.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.320]   So when Jesus goes to the cross, he's not going to the cross with people saying, "Don't
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.000]   die, don't die."
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.640]   He's going to the cross with a nation that he's trying to save when he says, "He demonstrates
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.200]   his own love toward us while we were yet sinners."
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.000]   And when he says, "While we were yet sinners," we're talking about his own people that he
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.840]   loved and cared for, that all this description that he's giving, that those are the people
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.360]   who are going to say, "Crucify him.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.360]   Get rid of this guy."
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.360]   Right?
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.280]   So, in verse 4, "But I said, 'I have labored in vain.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.040]   I have spent my strength for nothing in vanity.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.280]   Yet,'" right?
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:45.320]   "Despite all of that, despite their rejection, 'yet surely my right is with the Lord, and
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.520]   my recompense is with God.'"
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:53.640]   That even in the midst of utter human failure, in the midst of all this darkness, God is
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.640]   going to make this right.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.640]   Right?
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.000]   What is that, what is he in reference to?
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.480]   Clearly he's talking about the cross.
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.480]   Right?
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.120]   So again, he's giving glimpses, like, "This is what's going to happen, this is what's
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.120]   going to happen."
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.600]   And this is all embedded in Scripture, before it ever happens.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:16.680]   I don't know how they would have understood that.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:24.440]   You know, like this, I'm sure, like, us looking in retrospect, like, we see clearly, if, clearly
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:29.040]   he's talking about the Messiah, and then now that we identify this is the Messiah, even
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:38.320]   the aspect where he says, "In the shadow of," is he, I don't know.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:55.000]   There's a part here, um, where's the part he says, "I have," where he talks about his
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   hand?
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   Huh?
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Is it verse 2?
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   I don't know, I'm not going to sharpen the shadow, is he?
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   No, no, no.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   >> Verse 13.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   >> Verse 13?
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   >> Verse 13 to 48.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   >> Huh?
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   48?
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   >> Verse 8.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   >> No, it's not, he says, huh?
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   >> Verse 16.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   >> Verse 16.
