[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   All right, let's look at Chapter 21.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.920]   Okay, just a quick announcement.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.040]   Next Wednesday we do not have Bible study here because it's Thanksgiving week.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.640]   And so next week we have a break and then the week after that we'll be finishing up
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.320]   Chapter 22.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.640]   And then after that, December 6th will be our last session where we're going to be reviewing.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.440]   So we're going to be reviewing the 22 chapters that we went over.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.660]   So it's going to be a little bit longer review.
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.660]   But our last day of Bible study for Revelation is going to be December 6th.
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.640]   And part of the reason why we're finishing a little bit earlier is because our home Bible
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.520]   study meets a week after.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.940]   So if we don't finish on the 6th, they will end up having Bible study during the Christmas
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.740]   that the week that they should be getting break.
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.740]   So either way, it works out because we have only one more chapter to go after today.
[00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.040]   So we have this chapter and then Thanksgiving break and then the week after that, Chapter
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.040]   22.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.640]   Okay, so let me pray first and then we'll jump right in.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:11.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the blessing that we have.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.480]   We thank you for our families.
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.720]   We thank you for our jobs.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.600]   We thank you, Lord, that even in where we live, that we have the freedom to be able
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:28.000]   to meet with you, to study to our heart's content, to fellowship, to build your church
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.440]   and all the opportunities that we can imagine.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.280]   You've allowed us to be able to be in a position where we can access all of these things.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.200]   Help us not to take any of these things for granted, especially your word, that we would
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.920]   study it, meditate on it, and apply the things that, Lord God, that we are studying.
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.880]   So we ask you would guide us and lead us.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.880]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.380]   Amen.
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.980]   All right, so for the next two weeks, as we look at Chapter 21 and 22, we're looking
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.380]   at the new heaven and new earth and new Jerusalem.
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.940]   Basically it's a topic of heaven.
[00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:12.060]   It is the most clearest and the heaviest concentration on the teaching of heaven in any other parts
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.060]   of the Bible.
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.120]   So obviously this is an important doctrine, an important part of everything that God has
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.500]   been doing, kind of culminated up to this point to get us to heaven.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.340]   But I think the doctrine of heaven probably is just as misunderstood as doctrine of hell.
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.140]   Because so much of how people imagine heaven is from the secular community, it's from
[00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.180]   the movies that you watch or from books that you've read or just generally from the culture.
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.660]   And so a lot of Christians don't know the distinction between what came from the Bible
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.260]   and what came from the secular world.
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.100]   And so I think it's important for us to understand what it's saying in Chapter 21 and 22.
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.720]   And there are obviously bits and pieces that are taught in other passages, but the heaviest
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.200]   concentration, the clearest teaching of heaven is in these two chapters.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.460]   So hopefully as we're studying it, that you can decipher, maybe you had certain thoughts
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.580]   of what you were to expect when you get to heaven and compare that to what you were reading
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.620]   in Chapter 21 and 22.
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.700]   Was that biblical or was that you get that from somewhere else?
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.020]   So again, I run into people all the time, whenever we talk about heaven, they think,
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.900]   "Yeah, when I get to heaven, it's going to be like this."
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.460]   It's like, well, that's more of our imagination than actual teaching.
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.460]   Okay?
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.460]   All right.
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.600]   So let's begin.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.980]   So new heaven and new earth.
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.180]   So verse one begins by saying, "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first
[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.000]   heaven and the first earth had passed away and the sea was no more."
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.380]   So whatever was here before this period, he says that the new heaven and new earth is
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.860]   going to come.
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.120]   And this is the final destination of redemptive history, new heaven and new earth.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.280]   So obviously everything that we've been studying up to this point is to lead us and get us
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.780]   to this point, right?
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.820]   So ever since the fall of mankind, everything that God has been doing is to bring us to
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.740]   this end.
[00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.740]   So when the scripture says he's the alpha and the omega, right?
[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.980]   This is the part of the omega.
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.740]   This is the final destination.
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.260]   Jesus himself said, now the significance of this, Jesus himself said that he was departing
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.780]   from his disciples to go prepare a place for his disciples, right?
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.260]   So John 14, two to three says, "In my father's house are many rooms.
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.940]   If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you?
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.900]   And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.500]   that where I am, you may also be."
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.920]   So what we're studying today is a new heaven and new earth is where Jesus is preparing
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.500]   a place for us, right?
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.460]   And again, in Isaiah 65, 17, it's prophesied, "For behold, I create a new heaven and a new
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.540]   earth and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind."
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.700]   So this is not unique to revelation.
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.060]   God has been prophesying this from old.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.100]   Isaiah 62, 22, "For as the new heavens and the new earth that I may shake remain before
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.740]   me," says the Lord, "so shall your offspring and your name remain."
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.740]   I think a final, I think I have one more, yeah, sorry.
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.140]   In 2 Peter 3, 13, "But according to his promise, we are waiting for a new heavens and new earth
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.100]   in which righteousness dwells."
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.580]   So again, new heaven and new earth has that language and that description has been implanted
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.420]   in scripture all over.
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.900]   And so chapter 21 and 22 is a specific teaching concerning that doctrine.
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:05.980]   And heaven is described as a physical place, right?
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.840]   It is not a state of mind.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.960]   Make that clear.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.940]   The scripture does not describe heaven as some place after you die and then your spirit
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.660]   just kind of wanders off and then you're kind of in this eternal state of mind.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.140]   That's not how heaven is described in scripture.
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.100]   Scripture describes heaven as a physical place.
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:36.580]   So when the new heaven, the old earth and old heaven passes away, the new heaven and
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.020]   new earth comes and replaces it.
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.380]   So again, let me get to that.
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.900]   So the physical place, part of the reason why we say it's physical, Enoch and Elijah,
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.220]   if you remember, these two people don't die and they actually get raptured and in their
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:02.220]   physical state they get up to heaven, stated in Genesis and 2 Kings.
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.780]   Jesus himself in Acts 1-9, after his resurrection, did he have a physical body?
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.240]   Yeah, he had a physical body, right?
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.820]   He had a physical body but it wasn't a normal body, it was a glorified body after the resurrection.
[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.460]   Nevertheless, it was physical.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.640]   It was not physical like the way you and I have it, but it is physical in the sense that
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.980]   there was something concrete, right?
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.020]   And so in his glorified body, he went up and he ascended and then he promised that as he
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.820]   ascended, he will also come.
[00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.980]   So when he comes, he's going to come in that glorified body where he was able to sit and
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.300]   have a meal with the disciples, have conversation.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.860]   It wasn't just some mystical spirit that resurrected.
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:48.060]   And so not only did Jesus resurrect and physically go to heaven, the scripture says that we will
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.800]   also be resurrected in the same way Jesus was resurrected and in that resurrected body
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.660]   we are going to be in heaven, right?
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:04.260]   So the new heaven and new earth, as heaven is described, this is not, again, not simply
[00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:11.300]   a state of mind, but the reality is physical.
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.460]   Romans 8, 19-22, this is a passage that we looked at a while back, but it says, "For
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:20.020]   the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God.
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:24.940]   For the creation was subjected to futility, not willing, but because of him who subjected
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:29.820]   it in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.060]   the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.520]   For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.620]   until now."
[00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:41.780]   So this is a description of what happened to creation itself because of the fall, right?
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:48.980]   Remember, he says after they fall in Genesis chapter 3, God describes the fall of creation
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:55.300]   where he's going to work and toil and instead of bearing fruit, what's going to come out
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.300]   of the ground?
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.100]   Thorns and thistles, right?
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:05.780]   And so he describes a fallen state as working hard and not being able to bear fruit, okay?
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:12.700]   And so not only did mankind fall, but all of creation was subjected to futility.
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.260]   And so when Christ comes, he said he's bringing a new heaven and new earth.
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:23.380]   So basically he's recreating, restoring what God intended.
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.980]   Hebrews 12, 26-27, "At that time, his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised,
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.100]   yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens."
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.260]   This phrase, "yet once more," indicates the removal of things that are shaken, that is
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.460]   things that have been made in order that the things that cannot be shaken may remain.
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:45.740]   Again, he's talking about restoring what was lost and the new heaven and new earth is going
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:51.380]   to come and replace it.
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:57.100]   The earth and heaven will not be completely done away with, but will be restored and renewed.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.660]   So the language is not that he's going to take the old earth and completely destroy
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.300]   it and then something completely new is going to come.
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:10.100]   The language that is used here, the Greek word "kainos" for new, is not referring to
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:17.060]   new as in chronological, but in qualitative sense, meaning that the earth, the creation
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:23.360]   that was subjected to futility is going to be renewed.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.060]   So he's not replacing it, he's renewing it, and that's the language that he's using here.
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:33.980]   So heaven is a physical place that once the millennial kingdom is done away with, the
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.240]   white throne judgment takes place, and then the final state of mankind is God's going
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:44.740]   to bring a new heaven and new earth, and so it's going to be a physical place here, right?
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:55.640]   But it's obviously going to be a different state, but it's going to be physical.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.300]   So the heaven that he is talking about, and I wanted to explain this and I'll talk a little
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.100]   bit more about this later, the heaven that he is talking about here is not talking about
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.340]   heaven where God is sitting on his throne.
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.580]   He's not saying that that heaven is going to be passing away and a new heaven is going
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.340]   to restore that.
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:16.220]   The heaven he's talking about when he says heaven and earth, the Bible often describes
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:22.380]   heaven as material and immaterial, or the earth and the sky.
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.380]   Does that make sense?
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:28.260]   So he's not talking about heaven as in where God sits, what you and I think.
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:33.620]   So the Bible oftentimes uses the language of heaven and earth, meaning all of creation.
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.620]   Does that make sense?
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:39.180]   Okay, you're looking at me like you have no idea what I'm talking about.
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:44.860]   When the Bible describes, in this particular passage, in context, he's not saying heaven
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:49.380]   where God is sitting on the throne, all the vision that John had of God sitting on the
[00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:55.420]   throne and being worshipped and the creatures flying around and worshipping him, holy, holy,
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.420]   holy.
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.140]   He's not talking about that heaven.
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.020]   That heaven is not corrupted.
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.260]   It did not face decay because of the fall of men.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.900]   He's not talking about that heaven.
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:11.300]   When he says heaven and earth, he's talking about all of creation, the earth and the sky.
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.060]   Does that make sense?
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.340]   Okay.
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:19.720]   So just wanted to clarify that he's not talking about heaven that we know of where God sits
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.220]   on his throne is being renewed.
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:26.140]   He's talking about all of creation is going to be renewed.
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.020]   He says that the sea will be no more.
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:34.380]   So obviously, the earth that you and I know is going to look very different, right?
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.420]   The two thirds of the earth is covered by water.
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:42.060]   So if you don't have the sea, that means the earth is going to be a lot more land than
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.960]   sea.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:50.100]   Because there's no water, there's not going to be any need for separation by land with
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.100]   people.
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.740]   There's no need for water to sustain life.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:13:00.420]   And as it says in verse six, that God will be the source of the water that we need.
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.340]   Verse six it says, "And he said to me, 'It is done.
[00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.340]   I am the Alpha and Omega, and beginning and the end, to the thirsty I will give from the
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.220]   spring of water of life without payment.'"
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:13.100]   In other words, there's no need for external water because God himself is going to provide
[00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.380]   that.
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.700]   So the description is a new heaven and new earth, right?
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:24.060]   And then starting from verse, what verse is it?
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:28.580]   Verse nine, he describes a new Jerusalem.
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:34.500]   Is the new Jerusalem separate from new heaven and new earth?
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:46.660]   What do you think?
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.580]   There's different theories to this.
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:54.820]   John MacArthur actually calls the new Jerusalem the capital of heaven.
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:55.820]   That doesn't mean it's right.
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:59.380]   Don't say, "Oh, okay, that's what it is."
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.100]   That's one of the theories because he describes a new heaven and new earth and then he's talking
[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.540]   about new Jerusalem.
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.580]   I don't think it's separate.
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:12.420]   I think new Jerusalem is another way of referring to new heaven and new earth.
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.460]   He's talking about heaven.
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.740]   And if you look at it, the reason why he calls it Jerusalem is because that's the name of
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:22.780]   heaven, the new Jerusalem.
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:29.300]   So we're going to approach it this evening not as two separate things, but again, the
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:36.140]   new Jerusalem is a description of heaven.
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:41.300]   There are three separate times that Jerusalem as a city is mentioned in the Bible.
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:47.060]   The first is the city of David, which is what we call it now, the physical city of Jerusalem,
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:53.020]   city of David is referred to as the city of Jerusalem.
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:58.420]   The second time the city of Jerusalem is mentioned is at the millennial kingdom where Christ
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:05.820]   comes and the messianic rule is going to take place during the thousand-year reign of Christ.
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:09.980]   And at that time, the base would be the new Jerusalem.
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:16.020]   And then the third time is here, where he's referring to the eternal and final state,
[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.140]   which is heaven.
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:37.820]   So new Jerusalem is just another word to describe heaven.
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.740]   So Jerusalem is described as a bride prepared for the bridegroom.
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:46.820]   And then in verse nine, it says, "Then came one of the seven angels who had the seven
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:51.660]   bowls full of the seven last plagues and spoke to me saying, 'Come, I will show you the bride,
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.820]   the wife of the Lamb.'"
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:59.980]   So again, in the New Testament, the church is called the bride, but in the final state,
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:05.460]   it says that the city of Jerusalem is going to be his bride and then ultimately his wife,
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:09.780]   meaning that there's going to be intimate connection with God and the city.
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.780]   This is his dwelling.
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:18.700]   This is his house.
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:24.780]   The new Jerusalem is measured in, I think it's verse nine through 21, takes a long list
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:31.860]   of the different heights and the walls and various things.
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:38.700]   If you take the measurement literally, it describes a cube.
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.140]   And this is a gigantic cube.
[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:46.580]   It would be maybe a one-fourth size of the earth, but cubed.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.940]   And all the space inside would be occupied.
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:54.740]   Again, if we take it literally, that's what it's describing.
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:59.640]   It would be about 1,400 miles, and every measurement is the same.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:04.140]   So again, 1,400 wide, 1,400 high, 1,400 deep.
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:08.300]   So it's describing a cube.
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:15.060]   Now if this is a physical kingdom and he actually has the measurements as 1,400, is it 1,400?
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.060]   14,000.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:17.060]   Now 1,400.
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.060]   No, it's 1,400.
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.060]   It's got to be more than 1,400.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:32.200]   How many miles is it from here to China?
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.200]   Anybody know?
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.200]   Is it 5,000?
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.200]   7,000.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.200]   7,000.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:41.000]   Okay, so then that measurement is right then.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.160]   Okay.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.040]   So 1,400 cubed, right?
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:52.280]   And so if it's a physical kingdom, literally, could people fit, right?
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.180]   If you consider how many people...
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:59.060]   Guy actually did a study on this, and there's always people who will go this extra step
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.680]   to make sure, right?
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:05.580]   So this guy named Robert Rouse, and he wrote an article called "The Immensity of the New
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.680]   Jerusalem," and based upon the measurement, this is what he says.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.100]   One estimate of the total number of humans that have ever lived on the planet up to this
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:18.420]   point is figured around 106.5 billion people, right?
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.620]   So for the sake of argument, if we assume each and every one gets a place in the city
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:29.660]   that leaves enough room for everyone to have a house that's about 1,500 feet on each side
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:34.500]   or 2.25 million square feet on each level and around 150 stories tall.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.900]   In other words, it seems there will be more than enough room for everyone.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:43.300]   So this is based upon 106.5 billion people up to this point, but we know that that's
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.300]   the total number of people who've existed.
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.100]   We're not talking about Christians, right?
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.160]   The number of Christians is far less than that, but based upon these numbers.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.440]   So this is just to tickle your brain.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.540]   Somebody actually argued about the Noah's Ark.
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.700]   It's like, "Oh, every single animal fit in?"
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.500]   Somebody actually did a study on that too.
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.340]   They're looking at the measurement of the Noah's Ark and they found out that about,
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:14.060]   what are they, 96% of all species that we know of are under the size of a cat.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.140]   And so we think of like, "How can these elephants and these whales fit in?"
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.700]   And he said, "Only a very small percentage are actually that big.
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:21.760]   Most of the animals are small.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.980]   So when you consider and put them all together," they said, "they could easily fit in the ark."
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:31.340]   Again, that's, you know, there's people who are that precise.
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:35.140]   These are engineers that's like, "It could be possible," or architect, and they've actually
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.420]   done some of those studies.
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.580]   So you can Google that kind of stuff.
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:43.020]   But just, you know, out of curiosity, if it is a physical kingdom and it's described as
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:49.340]   1,400 miles square, it is physically possible to fit all Christians in there that has ever
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.480]   lived.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:20:00.100]   If you notice the description of their measurements, if you get to, I think it's verse 13.
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.020]   I think it's verse 13.
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.580]   Verse 13 describes on the east there are three gates, on the north there's three gates, in
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.820]   the south there's three gates, in the west there's three gates.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:13.680]   And he describes how in each of these gates there's three.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:18.140]   This is the picture of the tabernacle in the Old Testament.
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:24.540]   And so in the Old Testament description of the tabernacle, he commands the 12 tribes
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:28.320]   to all sit on three, three on each side.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:34.840]   And then inside, like this area, these are all the Levitical tribes, right?
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:40.140]   And so this is how God commanded them to make sure when they camp and then when they take
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:43.500]   off, they all have to take off in order, and then when they encamp, they have to come back
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.660]   in this order.
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.260]   So they weren't just randomly camping around the tabernacle.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.740]   God told them specifically to sit and to camp around this way when they were camped.
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.780]   And so if you look at the description of the New Jerusalem, the New Jerusalem sounds a
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:02.220]   lot like the way that the tabernacle and the Israelites were connected, okay?
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:07.740]   With the three gates on each side and the angels and sitting on each one of them.
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:12.420]   So again, all of these things that we see in the Old Testament is reflected in the New
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:16.260]   Testament or in the end times.
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:23.740]   I'm going to go over how the Bible describes this New Jerusalem.
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.300]   He says it's going to be made new.
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.460]   God's redemptive plan is going to be finished.
[00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:37.320]   Again, in 1 Corinthians 15, 24, it says, "Then comes the end when he delivers the kingdom
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.340]   to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power.
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.340]   For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.940]   The last enemy to be destroyed is death.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:52.440]   For God has put all things subjection under his feet, but when it says all things are
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:57.980]   put in subjection, it is plain that he is expected who put all things in subjection
[00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:58.980]   under him.
[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.500]   When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:07.260]   him who put all things in subjection under him that God may be all in all."
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:12.020]   So if you notice how many times he says all things, all subjection, all of it, over and
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:16.340]   over again, meaning that it's going to be complete, right?
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:20.180]   That everything that rebelled against God is going to be judged and it's going to be
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:21.180]   terminated.
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.840]   It's going to experience the second death in the lake of fire as it was described in
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.080]   chapter 20.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:32.040]   So only that which is pure, everything that is put under his subjection, right, that was
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.200]   in rebellion, once that happens, he says eternity is going to come.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.680]   So he mentions over and over again, all, everything.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:43.560]   There's not going to be anything that enters into Jerusalem that has any taint of any kind
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.960]   of rebellion.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:52.780]   All that is going to be weeded out and judged before that happens.
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:58.060]   The reason why heaven is heaven is because it is the place where God dwells, right?
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:03.220]   So this is why we're talking about how the new heaven and new earth is going to be renewed
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:08.740]   and then this Jerusalem, the throne of God is going to be where Jerusalem is, where heaven
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:09.740]   is.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.780]   This is where he's going to make his dwelling permanently, right?
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.980]   God will be there, it says, forever and ever.
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:24.540]   It will be permanent.
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:30.420]   And what makes heaven unique is not because of the creation, it's not because of the beauty,
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.020]   there's not going to be any weeds.
[00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.340]   I hope there's no rats there.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.380]   I'm assuming there's no rats there, okay?
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:43.220]   And everything that was created because of the fall is going to be destroyed, right?
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.580]   But that's not why heaven is attractive.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.340]   Heaven is attractive because that's where God's glory is.
[00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:55.220]   If we fell short of the glory of God and you and I are experiencing basically living away
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:00.260]   from God because we're away from his glory, the whole purpose of redemption is to bring
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.940]   us back into his glory.
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:07.540]   And so heaven is a place where we're going to be experiencing his glory in his fullness
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:11.020]   for eternity, right?
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:15.060]   So you can imagine saying like, when I get to heaven, I wish I was a little bit taller
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:20.500]   or skinnier or I could dunk and I'm going to have a mansion and you can say all this
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.780]   stuff and I'm going to eat Korean barbecue and never gain weight and you can imagine
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:28.820]   all of these things that you wish you could have, right?
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.780]   But that's just imagination.
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:37.980]   What is described is the ecstasy and the joy and all that comes along is because we're
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.100]   going to be in the presence of his glory for eternity.
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:48.620]   And that's how the Bible describes it as a place, a city where he's going to be shining.
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.840]   The scripture tells us, and again, this is not in Revelation, but the scripture tells
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:57.700]   us that our God dwells in unapproachable light.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.940]   And the reason why is because of our sins.
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:05.700]   First Timothy 6, 16, "Who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.740]   one has ever seen or can see."
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:14.220]   And Exodus 33, 20, "God himself said, but he said, 'You cannot see my face, for man
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.880]   shall not see me and live.'"
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.900]   But in heaven, we're going to be in his presence.
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.960]   We're going to be in this light for eternity.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:30.040]   This is all a description of fallen man, that we are not able to approach him because of
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.300]   our sins.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:37.820]   So now we have been clad, well, we can have this relationship, but we are not in our final
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.460]   state.
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:44.580]   So that's how Jerusalem is described.
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:51.540]   Presently, even the glimpse that we do have of him is dim.
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.860]   First Corinthians 13, 12, "For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face.
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:01.880]   Now I know in part, then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known."
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.420]   So this is all a description of heaven.
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:12.360]   Everything that you and I imagine about God is from a distance, dimly.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.960]   So we're kind of making an outline of him.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.320]   If you see God, you're able to tell.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:23.320]   But even now, even as we study the Bible, there's a lot of wrestling, like, "What does
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.320]   this mean?
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.700]   Does God really want this or not?"
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:32.400]   Part of it is because we are watching him and hearing him from a distance.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:38.640]   But when we get to heaven, there will be no debate as to God's desires, his will, his
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.320]   character, his nature.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:45.000]   You don't have to ask anybody, "What does God being holy mean?
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.440]   What is God's love like?"
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:53.240]   You don't have to ask anybody because you're going to physically experience that firsthand.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.440]   You don't need anybody to give sermons.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.280]   Sermons are going to be done in heaven, right?
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:05.360]   Because you don't need to hear sermons because you're going to hear from God directly.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.240]   And ultimately, we will not only hear from him, not only know him, he said, we will actually
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.480]   become like him in 1 John 3.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.980]   "Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared.
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:20.560]   But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him because we shall see him as he
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.800]   is."
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:29.920]   So what is the cause of our transformation according to this passage?
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.080]   Seeing him, right?
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.800]   We shall become like him because we will see him.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:39.120]   So part of the reason why we aren't changing is because we're not seeing him.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:43.880]   We only see a glimpse of his glory, so we get the taste of sanctification.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:48.280]   But when we get to heaven, because we will see him as he is, we will be transformed.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:54.560]   So being in the presence, full presence of his glory is going to transform us, right?
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:28:00.720]   And that's going to happen in the New Jerusalem that's described here.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:06.120]   So all the things about sanctification and I wish I could be this, I wish I could be
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:10.440]   that, you know, like in Philippians 160 says, "He who began a good work will carry it
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.720]   on to completion until the day of Christ," right?
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:19.160]   And basically it's saying that your struggle of sanctification is going to happen, you're
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.840]   never going to find completion until the day of Christ.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.560]   Well, this is the day of Christ.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:31.360]   When he comes, all that struggle, all that struggle against sin, all of that is going
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:35.560]   to be made complete when we see him face to face.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.280]   We're going to be transformed.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.280]   It's not going to require work.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.040]   It's not going to require accountability, right?
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:47.160]   You don't need small groups, you don't need pastors, you don't need elders, right?
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:55.040]   Seeing his glory face to face is going to cause you to be transformed.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:59.280]   He says, "All tears will be wiped away."
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:18.320]   The people who are thirsty will be able to drink without pay.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.320]   The thirst here is not just talking about water, right?
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:27.320]   Jesus talked about that, remember, in John 4, 13 to 14?
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.000]   He said, "The water that you drink is going to cause you to be thirsty again, but the
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.320]   water I give you, if you drink of it, you'll never thirst again."
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.200]   Jesus was not talking about physical thirst.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:43.220]   He's talking about this thirst that's created from being away from God, right?
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:44.220]   Because we're separated.
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:52.160]   So every single one of us, there is a hungering for longing for meaning, longing for companionship,
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.400]   longing to be valued, to be loved.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:30:02.040]   At the core of who we are, longing to live, at the core of who we are, every single one
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:07.360]   of us, there is a longing that's driving your life, isn't there?
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:13.800]   Longing to be a better husband, longing to live in safety, longing to be loved, longing
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:19.640]   to have friendship, whatever that longing is, that longing was created because of the
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.360]   fall.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:25.640]   And God uses that longing to bring people to himself, right?
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:30.440]   He says, "In heaven, that thirsting, that hungering is going to be satisfied by God
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.280]   himself."
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.200]   That he's not going to say, "Hey, come and ask me whatever you want."
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.080]   Say, "You know, I really wanted to have a good family," or whatever it is, and say,
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.600]   "God's going to provide all of that."
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.960]   He said, "No, all the longing is going to be met by Christ himself."
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:50.240]   In fact, it's described as this living water that's going to be coming from the throne
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.880]   of God.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.240]   If you read chapter 21, you probably read that already, right?
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:31:03.240]   That the living water that Jesus is promising is actually coming from the throne itself.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:07.560]   So whatever longing that we have that we are looking for in this world, he said, ultimately
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:13.840]   it's going to be fulfilled in Christ, in Jerusalem, ultimately.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:17.480]   It's not going to be your mansion, it's not going to be your athleticism, it's not going
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:23.680]   to be your looks, it's not going to be whatever it is that we kind of superficially attach
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.040]   fulfillment to.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:29.840]   He said, "Ultimately, all our longing is going to be met in Christ, without pay."
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.040]   You're not going to have to work on it.
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:38.680]   Just because you're in his presence in Jerusalem, this is what's going to happen.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:43.560]   But what's interesting is, if you read through the description in chapter 21 and then part
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:49.800]   of chapter 22, is that heaven is described more of a place that does not have these things
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.960]   than what it has.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.480]   It doesn't describe trees, it doesn't describe buildings, it doesn't describe...
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:02.600]   It does describe all these, the walls and the height and measurements, all of that.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:08.080]   Other than jewelry, these precious stones that it described, it doesn't describe the
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.080]   details.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.580]   It doesn't describe what the roads are going to look like.
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:15.920]   It doesn't describe what kind of fruits, it doesn't describe what kind of food you're
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:20.000]   going to have, are you going to wear clothes?
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.040]   There's not a lot of descriptions about what it's going to look like, but there's a lot
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:30.200]   of descriptions of what it won't have.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:35.120]   First thing, again, this is not in chronological order, but first thing that we know, it says
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:39.040]   that there is no death.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.880]   That was the first thing that Adam and Eve lost when they sinned.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.680]   He said, "If you eat of this tree, you shall surely die," and that's exactly what happened
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.800]   because they got separated from the author of life.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.940]   Everything that they've experienced, everything that mankind has experienced outside of God
[00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.120]   was basically death.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.300]   We think of death as physically not breathing.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:05.840]   That's not how the Bible describes death.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:09.760]   Death is darkness, death is being away from God's glory.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:15.960]   If God is the source of life and you're not connected to that life, then there's death.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:26.480]   If you have a computer, if you don't plug it in, it may look like a computer, it sounds
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:33.260]   like a computer, the screen looks like a computer, but without electricity, it's dead.
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:37.520]   It has potential for life, but it's dead.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:42.640]   That's how the Bible describes all mankind, that we're kind of walking around with the
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:47.480]   source of life being disconnected, and so everything that you and I experience is death.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.520]   It's not what God intended.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:56.040]   It's kind of like if you have a computer and there's no electricity and you're trying to
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:00.240]   figure out what to do with this computer, what would be a computer good for without
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:07.160]   electricity?
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.680]   Make the best of it.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:15.280]   Paperweight, protection from bullets.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.280]   What would it be good for?
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.480]   A ruler?
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:24.760]   You could imagine, but that's what life is.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:28.320]   All mankind who've been separated from God is not living the life that God intended you
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:34.920]   to live, is trying to make do with this physical body, the short period of time that we have.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.240]   So we say, "Well, it's about family.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:38.480]   It's about enjoyment.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.920]   It's about getting toys.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.920]   It's about experience.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:41.920]   It's about traveling."
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:47.640]   And so we're all trying to make do with what we don't understand, right?
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:51.520]   Because we're dead.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:57.320]   What gives life to the body isn't there, so we're taking this flesh and trying to bring
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.680]   meaning to it.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.080]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.600]   That's the description of mankind.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:12.560]   So when we go to heaven, the author of life in his full glory is going to be there forever,
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.560]   and when we enter, we're going to see him as he is, and as a result, we're going to
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:20.560]   be transformed, and the first thing that's going to disappear is death.
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.760]   You're going to experience life to the fullest.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.720]   Even now, we experience life in glimpses, right?
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:32.080]   And I think in periods when we experience God in times of worship, when the Word of
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:38.520]   God opens your eyes and you hear his voice, when you feel connected to the author of life,
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.600]   you experience life in glimpses.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:46.960]   But in Jerusalem, it's going to be permanent, constant, right?
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.360]   What was lost is going to be restored.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:54.480]   So it says, 1 Corinthians 15, 54, "When the perishable puts on the imperishable and the
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.960]   mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is when death is swallowed
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.520]   up in victory."
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:04.240]   Again, Hebrews 2, 14, "Since therefore the children share in the flesh and blood, he
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:08.240]   himself likewise partook of the same things that through death he might destroy one who
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.520]   has the power of death, that is the devil."
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:15.200]   What he accomplished, ultimately accomplished on the cross for us is that he swallowed up
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:20.000]   death for us, that we may experience this life in the new Jerusalem.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.240]   There's going to be no mourning, no crying, no more pain.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:32.040]   So in other words, all the mourning and crying and pain that you and I know of is directly
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.640]   linked to sin.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.680]   And the only reason why we're talking about how suffering is good for us is because suffering
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.040]   leads us to God.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:45.040]   If suffering causes you to curse God, suffering is not good.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.920]   Suffering in and of itself is not good.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.160]   Suffering came as a result of the fall.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:54.720]   The reason why Christians talk about suffering as good is because suffering causes us to
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.200]   long for God.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:00.640]   Suffering causes us to cling to him.
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:05.840]   But suffering was created because of the fall.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:14.280]   So I was just sitting and thinking, what causes you to mourn?
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:18.000]   What causes you to cry?
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.320]   What kind of pain have you experienced?
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.320]   Think about it.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:30.480]   I mean, you probably, you know, this is not a unique experience to certain people.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.960]   Sometimes people ask me, "Oh, isn't being a pastor hard?"
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:38.080]   Being a human being is hard, I think.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.980]   I think it's hard being a physician.
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:43.600]   I think it's hard being a salesman.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.200]   I think it's hard being a student.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:49.400]   I think it's really hard being married.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:54.080]   I think it's really hard not being married.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:55.500]   That's human experience.
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:38:01.080]   It just happens to be I'm a pastor and you guys are other things, but I don't think sin
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:05.260]   is exaggerated for a pastor than other people.
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.680]   So everybody experiences pain.
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.920]   Everybody experiences mourning and crying, right?
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.720]   Because we live in a fallen world.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.520]   This is not unique to me.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.840]   It's not unique to our generation, right?
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:23.880]   Suffering is not unique to the Egyptians or the Muslim world.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:24.880]   It's universal.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:29.520]   And he said, "When we get into New Jerusalem, in the presence of His glory, all of that
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.520]   will be wiped out."
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:35.080]   Isaiah 53 promises, it says, "He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.600]   acquainted with grief.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:41.840]   And as one from whom men hide their faces, He was despised and we esteemed Him not.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:46.200]   But He has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows, yet we esteemed Him stricken, smitten
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.920]   by God and afflicted.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.560]   But He was wounded for our transgression.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.840]   He was crushed for our iniquities.
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.880]   Upon Him was the chastisement, brought us peace.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:59.320]   And with His stripes, we are healed."
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:05.880]   So ultimately, what you and I experience is, again, it's not simply deliverance from hell,
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:10.240]   but it's deliverance from human experience, right?
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.320]   And so again, you know, I don't have to mention it.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.640]   I don't even have to ask you.
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:22.480]   Every single one of you have scars, deep scars, some of you.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.760]   Some of it, some people know about.
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.480]   Some of it, some people don't know about.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:31.120]   But there's not a single person in this room that don't have deep scars, because you're
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.760]   human and you and I live in a fallen world.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:39.040]   And until we're delivered from this body and from this fallen world, that's human experience.
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:44.760]   And He said, "In Jerusalem, it will be wiped out."
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:49.200]   So all this superficial thing about living in a mansion is like, it's not the mansion
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.440]   that's going to make heaven heaven.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:58.320]   God is what makes heaven heaven.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:07.520]   In fact, Jesus said, Matthew 4, "Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted."
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.560]   There is no need for the temple, right?
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:14.480]   There's no need for the temple because God Himself is going to be there.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.480]   We don't need to go somewhere to meet God.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:20.040]   God Himself will be there.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:26.800]   There's no need for the sun or light, because God's glory will light the world, verse 23.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:33.320]   Again, prophesied in Isaiah 60, 19, "The sun shall be no more your light by day, nor for
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:37.880]   brightness shall the moon give you light, but the Lord will be your everlasting light,
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:42.720]   and your God will be your glory."
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:46.520]   You know, the Bible, obviously, we need the physical light to live, but the Bible also
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:50.800]   describes light as in righteousness, right?
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.520]   Clarity to know, right?
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:57.200]   There's nothing going to be hidden.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:06.440]   Think about how much of disagreements, hatred, bitterness, how much of that is a result of
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:11.360]   not understanding each other, right?
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.680]   Because we have a hard time discerning what is right and wrong.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:18.320]   How many times have you thought that you are absolutely right and found that absolutely
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:22.960]   wrong and the damage that it created, right?
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:29.600]   Things that we make, things that we do, because our head is muddied.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.600]   We don't know.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:34.720]   We have a hard time discerning righteousness, and that's why God gives us all these different
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:39.280]   things to go through to figure what is right and what is wrong.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.280]   We have the Scripture.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.280]   We have the Holy Spirit.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.280]   We have the church.
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:43.280]   We have elders.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.280]   We have leaders.
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.260]   You know, we have parents.
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:50.060]   We have our brothers and sisters in Christ, right?
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.920]   And so God gives us all of these things, all for what?
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.160]   To figure out what is right, right?
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.920]   And to figure out what is wrong.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.460]   So because it's that hard for us to discern right and wrong.
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:06.800]   And the moment that you think that you have it figured out, he says, "Watch out, because
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.640]   then you will fall," he says, right?
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:16.360]   Because pride is the first thing that you bolster up before you fall.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:21.240]   So when he says there's no need for the sun or the light, he's not simply just talking
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:26.720]   about the physical sun, although that probably is in reference to that, but there's going
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.720]   to be clarity.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:32.560]   We don't have to guess, right?
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:37.200]   So husband and wives, there is hope, right?
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.200]   You're going to know each other.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.200]   You're going to understand without opening your mouth.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:46.040]   Friends, church, fellowship, right?
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:50.800]   All of that is going to be much easier when righteousness and God's light is going to
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:56.600]   be the source and he's going to make everything clear.
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.520]   By its light, all the nations will walk.
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:02.120]   And again, the walk in the Bible is just not talking about like, "Oh, the lights are turned
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.880]   on," but walk is live, right?
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:12.000]   And so again, related to what we just said, that his glory is going to shine and all of
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.780]   the nations are going to be able to live because of his, right?
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:22.880]   So his glory is going to be the sustenance that's going to feed us.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:31.000]   All the kings and their glory will be brought into the city, meaning all that was in creation
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:38.080]   that was worthy of any kind of glory is going to be sucked up into this new Jerusalem, right?
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.080]   Gates will never be shut.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.520]   What is that imagery of?
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:48.000]   Why do the gates never need to be shut?
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:54.080]   What is a gate for, at least at that time and even now?
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:58.400]   Keep away your enemies for protection, right?
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:00.960]   Because that's God's city.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:04.240]   First of all, all the enemies are wiped out already, so there are no enemies.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.160]   So again, this is just the imagery.
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:10.020]   Whether there will be real gates that's going to be open, I don't know.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:14.200]   But the imagery is there's no need for fear.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.120]   All the enemies are gone.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:23.240]   And even if the enemies weren't gone, we're in the presence of our God.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:29.480]   If I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil if God is with
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.480]   me.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:37.040]   And so our eternal shepherd is going to be with us in his full glory.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.040]   And so the gates do not need to be shut.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.040]   It can be open.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:49.220]   You're going to be able to live in peace and safety and not live with fear.
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:52.280]   There will be no night.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:56.520]   Remember you guys were night owls, maybe thinking like, "Oh, no night?"
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:00.000]   I mean, think about why we have night.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.320]   Because of rest.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.320]   We need to recuperate.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.520]   And then we function during the day.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.840]   You and I are creatures of the light.
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.320]   So we function during the day.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:12.520]   And I know some of you, maybe you're night owls.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:17.000]   But even if you are night owls, you sleep at one or two o'clock, right?
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.040]   Because your company doesn't open up at three in the morning.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.040]   Maybe you do.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.040]   Maybe you're an internet guy.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.040]   I don't know.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.120]   But we naturally function during the day.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.400]   And at night, we recuperate.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:30.280]   So there's no need for night because there's no need for recuperation.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.680]   You're not going to be tired.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.960]   You don't need to gain more energy.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:34.960]   You don't get depleted.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.760]   And then so you got to rest up.
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:43.720]   We're going to be in the Sabbath, what God intended.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:44.720]   So I don't know.
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:49.800]   In the Garden of Eden, if Adam and Eve had a sleeping pattern, I'm not sure if that was
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.800]   the case.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.880]   But we know that they worked, right?
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:58.620]   And God brought them into his Sabbath to rest.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:01.120]   But that Sabbath was broken at the Garden of Eden.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.680]   And it's that Sabbath that God came to restore.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:08.160]   And that ultimate Sabbath is going to be at Jerusalem.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:11.460]   We're going to finally find rest, right?
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:18.000]   So one of the things that I always wrestle with, and I think I've talked about this before,
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.400]   is that because I'm in a position where I do a lot of counseling with people, and there's
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:28.760]   a lot of you, it's not just some of you, a lot of you have gone through some horrible
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:31.860]   stuff in life.
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:35.080]   You don't share with one another because it's not something that you just sit down and share
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.080]   with people.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:42.600]   But a lot of you have suffered a lot of horrible stuff in life, whether it was a family breakup
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:48.080]   or some kind of assault or something horrible happened to a lot of us.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:53.520]   Very few people in the church don't have scars.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:58.720]   And there's this unrest inside our heart trying to be restored.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:06.280]   And so you seek counseling, and you seek accountability, you seek this and that, and we're all searching.
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:10.240]   And early on in ministry, I tried so hard, like, what can I say?
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.680]   What books can we read?
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:12.680]   What kind of counseling?
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.840]   And then get them through and then walk them through these passages.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:24.840]   And I came to the conclusion that restoration ultimately is not here.
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:28.800]   The best that we can do is give them hope.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:35.440]   The best that we can do is to give you hope that there is an end, that there is restoration.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.960]   But you may not find it here.
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:41.800]   In fact, I don't think it was intended for you to find it here.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:46.520]   Because ultimate restoration of this unrest in your heart that was created because of
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:52.240]   sin, maybe your sins or sins of somebody else, that ultimate restoration is going to be when
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:55.280]   Christ comes in heaven.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:48:00.680]   And so when I realized that, I realized that the best that I can do is to give them hope
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:07.720]   in pointing to Christ, in sharing the gospel with them, that salvation is coming.
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:11.860]   You see him now, but the ultimate salvation is coming.
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:13.560]   Restoration is coming.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.940]   It may not be here.
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.660]   You may live with that scar until the day you die.
[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:22.220]   You may live with that unrest in your heart until the day you die, but it's coming.
[00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:26.520]   When the new Jerusalem comes, when Christ comes in his full glory, he says, "We're going
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:30.360]   to experience that rest."
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.960]   And then he says, "No detestable things."
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:36.660]   Part of the reason why is because there's going to be no rebellion, no sin in Jerusalem.
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:39.400]   Nothing detestable is going to be coming into this place.
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:47.700]   And then finally, again, "No unrepentant sinners," in verse 8.
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:55.280]   And only those who are written in the book of life, only true believers, not simply churchgoers,
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:01.320]   not people who are raised in the church, but true believers where their sins were cleansed.
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:05.360]   And true children of God are going to be in Jerusalem.
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:09.840]   And we're going to experience what everybody hopes the church would look like.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:13.240]   I hear people saying all the time, "Oh, church should be different."
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.240]   You're right.
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:18.960]   It should be different, but a lot of times it isn't different because we're not there
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.080]   yet.
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:28.560]   But there's a huge difference between the church community and outside the church because
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:34.200]   whatever sin you experience in the church, it's restrained sin.
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.120]   It's restrained sin.
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:38.960]   The Holy Spirit and the Word of God is restraining us.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:41.840]   Even when we are in anger, there's a restraining.
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:47.280]   If you've ever worked in a secular place and somebody gets mad at you and there is no restraint,
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:53.840]   if you're talking about sexual impurity, you see it in the church, but it is restrained.
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.480]   Even though it comes out, even though we experience sin, even in the church.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:01.680]   But you ever be in a place where a bunch of men gather together, and I'm just saying men
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:09.280]   because that's my experience, where there is no restraint, it is not the same.
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.540]   The church is not the same.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:18.840]   So whatever we're experiencing now, it is at some point, because we are being restrained,
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:22.360]   but when we get to heaven, there's no need for restraint because all of it is going to
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.440]   be wiped out.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:29.200]   No uncleanness, no rebellion, no unrepentant sinner will be there.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:34.520]   And all of us are going to have full access to God's glory.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:38.760]   So in conclusion, 1 John 3, 2-3, it says, "Beloved, we are God's children now, and what
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.620]   we will be has not yet appeared.
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:45.280]   But we know that when He appears, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him as He
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.280]   is.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:49.600]   And everyone who thus hopes in Him purifies himself as he is pure."
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:54.020]   And this is related to the discussion questions that I have.
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:51:02.460]   In light of what we know about where we're headed, like how much of our life is dictated
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:08.600]   by this hope of His second coming, or how much of our life is short-sighted, you know,
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:14.040]   like eager for whatever vacation that we planned, or maybe even our, you know, putting away
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:17.360]   enough money, whatever it is.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:21.280]   Sometimes it could be very short-sighted, but long-term wise, do we have a larger picture
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.280]   of the kingdom?
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:28.200]   And finally, 2 Peter 3, 11-13, "Since all these things are thus to be dissolved," meaning
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:35.380]   this current earth and heaven, "what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:40.160]   and godliness, waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:44.800]   the heavens will be set on fire and dissolve, and the heavenly bodies will melt as they
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:45.800]   burn?
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:50.080]   But according to His promise, we are waiting for new heavens and new earth in which righteousness
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:53.140]   dwells."
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:52:00.080]   I believe that the reason why we're given the book of Revelation is this, you know.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.120]   We try so hard to figure out, like, "Oh, when is it going to happen?
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.300]   Is Saddam Hussein the Antichrist?
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:07.340]   Is the Catholic Church the Antichrist?"
[00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:10.500]   Is that the, you know, and all of these things are intriguing, and I don't think there's
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:16.100]   anything wrong with it, but the ultimate goal of the book of Revelation is to get us to
[00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:23.900]   this, that the things that we get so easily entangled by, that so easily get excited about,
[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:27.980]   are all decaying and dying, right?
[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:33.280]   You're investing in a bank that's about to go bankrupt, right?
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:37.700]   You put money in there, and a year later, that bank is not going to exist.
[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:39.220]   They're about to be bankrupt.
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:40.900]   The judgment has been made.
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:43.380]   It's not like, "Oh, it might be bankrupt."
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:45.860]   He said, "No, it's going to go bankrupt.
[00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:47.380]   We don't know if it's going to be tomorrow.
[00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:49.180]   We don't know if it's going to be next year.
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:52.340]   So why would you put your money in that bank?"
[00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:57.880]   So the goal of the book of Revelation is to remind us that this world is decaying.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:01.300]   So remember, we talked about the scene of heaven and scene of earth.
[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:04.580]   The earth is just in chaos, right?
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:10.880]   Destruction, fire, famine, disease, war, and that's how the earth is pictured.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:14.380]   And then you see heaven, peace, God is reigning on the throne, being worshipped.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:20.900]   And he said that picture is going to be brought down to earth, and that's the Lord's prayer,
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:21.900]   right?
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:23.260]   Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:26.420]   Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:33.080]   So it's the picture that we saw of God on his throne coming down in a new Jerusalem.
[00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:36.560]   And so the goal of the book of Revelation is to bring us to this point.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:43.780]   If you and I know and believe that this is true, how should we now live?
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:49.020]   So the discussion question for tonight is, what is something new you learned about heaven
[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:52.180]   in this study that you didn't know before?
[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:56.140]   So how much of something that you've imagined to heaven, is it consistent with what you
[00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:57.140]   see in scripture?
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:59.700]   What is something new that you've discovered?
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:03.300]   How does heaven differ from the way the world imagines it?
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:08.460]   Maybe you knew it, but when you talk to maybe secular people or maybe watching movies and
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:12.300]   they describe heaven, what is the difference to how the Bible describes it?
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:16.220]   Third, how often do you think about going to heaven?
[00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:19.700]   Some people may even think it's morbid to even talk about that, because to go to heaven
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:21.640]   means to die, right?
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:28.740]   And yet the scripture says to put our hopes on that, whether we go because we die or whether
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:32.820]   we go because he comes, he says to fix our eyes upon that.
[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:36.100]   And does it have any impact on the way that you live on day to day?
[00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:37.620]   Okay, that's the third question.
[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:42.320]   And then fourth, what aspect of heaven do you look forward to the most?
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:50.220]   So let me pray for us and then I'll let you guys get into your small group.
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:56.540]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for reminding us of where we're headed.
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:55:01.840]   The rewards, Lord God, of being near you for eternity.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:11.400]   If there's any of us in this room, Lord God, are still foreign to a relationship with you,
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:17.500]   I pray, Father, that you would help us not to simply file these things away, but to carefully
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:23.340]   examine our hearts and our thoughts, what it is that we are hoping for, what it is that
[00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:29.560]   we are investing in, that we may live in light of what we are studying and what we know.
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:32.220]   I pray that you would bless the time of our discussion.
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:37.980]   I pray that we may be honest and open and that you would use, Lord, our fellowship and
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:42.840]   your word that you've already implanted in our hearts to judge the thoughts and intentions
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:44.460]   of who we are.
[00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:47.940]   If there's any hurtful ways in us, reveal it to us.
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:52.140]   I pray, Father God, that you would encourage, strengthen, and remind us of the hope that
[00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:53.140]   we have in Christ tonight.
[00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:55.060]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:56:05.060]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
