[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Okay, so let me pray for us and we'll jump right in.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.160]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for allowing us to have a place to come and worship you
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.120]   and fellowship together.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.120]   We pray, Father, that you would give us insight into your Word, and more than just a simple
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.240]   understanding, a greater conviction, a deepening of appreciation of what it is that we have
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.680]   in you, that our desire to spread the gospel, Lord God, would be deeply rooted in understanding
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.240]   of who you are and what you've done for us.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.360]   I pray for your blessing this evening.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.880]   Help us to have a great discussion.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.040]   Help us, Lord God, to dig deeper and to know your heart, Lord, through this text.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.920]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.000]   So just as a reminder, again, Colossians is divided into two major parts.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.840]   Remember, the first two chapters is doxology, right?
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.920]   Basically the doctrine of Christ, it basically goes over what the gospel is, and then chapter
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.400]   three he goes into therefore, right?
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.120]   Therefore, this is how you ought to live.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.960]   So chapter three and four, we've been in the exhortation of what we ought to do.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.720]   So chapter three, a large division of chapter three basically is because of what Christ
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.880]   has done, put off your old self and to put on what?
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.280]   To put on Christ, right?
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.880]   That was chapter three, right?
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.920]   The immediate application of the gospel is to put off your old self and put on Christ.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.640]   And then chapter four, the text that we're in today, specifically goes into prayer, but
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.400]   more specifically, not just general prayer, but prayer specifically engaged in what?
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.560]   Evangelism, right?
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.680]   Because that's kind of how it ends.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.440]   So if you look at all the majority of the writings in the New Testament, there is some
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.400]   push toward evangelism, right?
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.800]   Again, and it's, I don't know if that's something that needs to be pushed, but I think generally
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.960]   speaking, I don't know about you, but the first day I became a Christian, the first
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.520]   thing that came to my mind is who I was going to tell, right?
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.560]   I don't know how you became a Christian.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.680]   Maybe some of you guys kind of gradually became a Christian, so maybe you don't remember,
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.260]   but maybe some of you guys remember when you first became a Christian, right?
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.780]   When your eyes became open to the truth.
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.320]   I think that's a natural response of any human being.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.040]   I don't think that's anything unique to me, right?
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.500]   If you've come to realize that God is real, heaven and hell is real, that the Bible is
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.920]   real, then what else would you be thinking of other than who can I tell, right?
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.880]   This great news.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:50.280]   So Apostle Paul, all the letters that he writes, it's in the context of evangelism.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.260]   Churches that he's planted, he's following up on them, and then it ends in exhortation,
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.180]   so therefore now engage in this ministry.
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.500]   Whether you are like Apostle Paul going out to foreign lands as a missionary, or whether
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.500]   you're in your home, whether it's toward your family, whatever it may be, that the immediate
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.640]   response to every Christian is to go tell, right?
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.340]   That's why he says we are the light of the world.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.500]   You don't hide a light underneath the table, you put it on the top so all can see.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.240]   So that's kind of like how he's summing up the book of Colossians, right?
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.780]   After every exhortation, at the end, he says to pray and to pray deliberately.
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.160]   So if we look at it, remember one of the first things that we want to do in everything that
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.620]   we do is to give the outline, right?
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.960]   What is the broad outline here in this text?
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.380]   If you're texting me now, I'm not going to be able to get to it.
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.740]   I feel my phone buzzing in my back pocket, I'm not going to take it out, okay?
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.740]   So it's a little bit too late.
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.420]   Hopefully we'll be able to answer it without me looking at it, okay?
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.540]   So I would say verse two, right?
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.260]   Verse two, what do I have?
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.380]   Yeah verse two would be kind of like the first thought.
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.380]   Where's the second thought?
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.820]   Right?
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.180]   Three.
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.300]   Say something.
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.820]   Where's the second break?
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.820]   Three.
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:12.820]   Just three?
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.740]   Okay, three and four, and then five and six.
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:28.980]   So how would you label verse two?
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.820]   Call to pray, right?
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.700]   It's a call to prayer.
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.220]   And then three, four.
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.500]   What to pray, right?
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.500]   And then five and six.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.500]   Maybe I'm milking it, but I labeled it what to do after you pray, okay?
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.140]   It's not necessarily telling you to pray, but it is connected, right?
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.860]   It is connected to the call to prayer.
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.700]   All right, so let's look at the first one.
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:10.060]   Okay, devote yourself to pray.
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:17.020]   He doesn't just say to pray, but he says to be devoted to prayer, right?
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.020]   In fact, if you look at the New Testament, every time there is a calling to prayer, it
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.420]   is never casual, right?
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:29.540]   He says to be committed to prayer, to be deliberate about prayer, to be devoted to prayer.
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.620]   Like why does he tell us to be devoted, right?
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.860]   And I talked about this briefly on Friday.
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.860]   He says to keep alert.
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.380]   What is another way of saying keeping alert?
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.900]   Those of you who have different translations.
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.980]   To be watchful.
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.380]   That's the same word that's used when Jesus is at Gethsemane and he's telling his disciples,
[00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.900]   can you stay and watch?
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.540]   And he used that word three separate times to refer to the disciples praying, right?
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:03.820]   And when somebody tells you to keep watch, what are they asking you to do?
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.980]   What are they asking you to do?
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.380]   To guard something?
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.380]   Okay.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.380]   To guard something?
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.380]   Huh?
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.380]   Join them?
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:21.620]   Like if I say, hey, keep watch.
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.620]   Stay with me.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.620]   Okay.
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.620]   What else?
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.620]   Okay.
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.620]   Be alert.
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.620]   Be sober.
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.620]   Okay.
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.620]   Stay awake, literally.
[00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.620]   Okay.
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.620]   Watch out.
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.620]   What do you think if I say watch out?
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.620]   I look for danger.
[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.620]   Okay.
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.620]   So all of these ideas, when it says to pray, to guard something, to guard something, it's
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.620]   not just to guard something.
[00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.620]   It's to guard something.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.620]   Okay.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:39.620]   So, what does he say?
[00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.620]   He says to be alert.
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.620]   Okay.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.620]   To be alert.
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.620]   Okay.
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.620]   To be alert.
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.620]   Okay.
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.620]   To be alert.
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.620]   Okay.
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.620]   To be alert.
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.620]   Okay.
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.620]   To be alert.
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.620]   Okay.
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.620]   To be alert.
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.620]   Okay.
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.620]   So, what does he say?
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.620]   He says to guard something.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.620]   Right?
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.620]   Are Christians called to guard something?
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.620]   Absolutely.
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:59.620]   Right?
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.620]   Spiritually, we're supposed to guard the gospel.
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.620]   We're supposed to guard the church, guard the truth.
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.620]   Right?
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.340]   We're supposed to, when Jesus says to watch, he's basically telling his disciples to do
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.300]   what he's doing.
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.820]   And he's also using the idea of watch.
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.380]   We see it in the book of Ezekiel.
[00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.380]   Remember?
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.860]   He calls the watchman, and he says that God has called Ezekiel to be the watchman of Israel.
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:26.300]   And as he is watching, if God tells Ezekiel that judgment is coming, and he doesn't do
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.820]   anything, he doesn't warn anybody.
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.820]   Right?
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.100]   So his calling was to be the mouthpiece of whatever was coming to Israel.
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.400]   He's supposed to stand at the gate and watch to see the danger coming.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.220]   And if God says danger is coming and he does nothing, or he's falling asleep, he says the
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.340]   judgment is coming upon Ezekiel.
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.340]   Remember that?
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.340]   In the book of Ezekiel.
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.340]   Okay?
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.580]   So the idea of watching in the New Testament, in particular when Paul's talking about here,
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.660]   is a reminder to us that there's a spiritual battle.
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.660]   Right?
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:01.300]   Again, when we are, and this is why evangelism is so important in keeping us sober.
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:07.020]   When you are not engaged in getting the gospel out, you are constantly forgetting that we
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.500]   are engaged in spiritual battle.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.820]   Right?
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.540]   There's no spiritual battle in doing quiet time.
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.180]   There's no spiritual battle in coming to church and hanging out with friends.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:23.180]   There's no spiritual battle in getting the theology correct in your small group Bible
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.180]   study.
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.180]   Right?
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.140]   How do we engage in the spiritual battle?
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.980]   Taking the light to the darkness.
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:31.980]   Right?
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.780]   So when you are not engaged in some context, I'm not saying that you have to go out to
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.860]   China or you have to be sharing the gospel with non-believers out in the street every
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:45.260]   single day, but if there isn't some kind of engagement and deliberate attempt to get the
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:50.060]   gospel out, your prayers are going to be affected.
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.620]   Right?
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:56.620]   It's hard to remain sober when you're not engaged in the battle.
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:01.380]   So the call to prayer is really a call to battle when he says to watch.
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.380]   Right?
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.180]   I mean, when do you feel the urgency to pray?
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.940]   When something is happening in your life.
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:14.380]   So typically what happens is you pray when something emergency happens in your life that
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:15.820]   you can't control.
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.900]   Right?
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:22.820]   Even we Christians will pray when you're sick or something disastrous happens or you've
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.460]   gone to the mission field, you're engaged in some kind of work.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.460]   Right?
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.660]   I'll bet you if you've ever been to short term missions that you probably prayed more
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:35.340]   than you did when you didn't go because you have a work to be done and you want to make
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.580]   sure you're being fruitful.
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.580]   You want to get this right.
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.540]   So you're asking God to pray.
[00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:40.540]   Right?
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:45.620]   So when you are engaged in God's work, it causes you to be sober to be more prayerful.
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.940]   But when you're not engaged in it, what are you praying for?
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:49.980]   Right?
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.420]   So you may be praying for comfort.
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.320]   You may be praying for safety, but it's not it's not prayer for battle.
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.180]   It's pray that God would protect what's important to you.
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.180]   Right?
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:06.300]   And so typically those type of prayers are still prayers, but it's not powerful prayer.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.940]   Right?
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.580]   Because we're not necessarily engaged in what God desires for us.
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:16.820]   So he says to devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it, being watchful and with
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.740]   an attitude of thanksgiving.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.740]   Right?
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:24.620]   Why is thanksgiving always attached to prayer?
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:33.620]   Philippians 4, 6, be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.100]   thanksgiving that you request be known to God.
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:40.100]   Colossians 3, 15, let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts to which indeed you were
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.460]   called in one body and be thankful.
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:46.060]   And over and over again, prayer and thankfulness go hand in hand.
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.060]   Right?
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:53.100]   Why is thankfulness important in effectiveness in prayer?
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.540]   How is thankfulness connected to prayer?
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.780]   Okay.
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:08.020]   It's connected to our faith.
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.020]   Right?
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.020]   James says that.
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.220]   He who comes to God must first believe that he is.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.220]   Right?
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:21.980]   So he, one, thankfulness is related to prayer because we believe that he's going to answer.
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.140]   So you already come believing that God's going to answer.
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.140]   Right?
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:30.220]   But another part of thankfulness in prayer is the fact that you're able to pray, you
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.900]   should be thankful.
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.220]   Right?
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:38.740]   The fact that you have access to God should automatically, even before you pray, you know
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:45.980]   what I mean, the fact that you are able to enter into his throne with confidence is because
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.740]   of what Jesus has done.
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.740]   Right?
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.140]   So even before we even engage in prayer, he says to devote yourselves in prayer, being
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:58.660]   sober, being watchful, engaging in the spiritual battle with an attitude of thanksgiving.
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:05.540]   Now let me make this as crystal clear as possible.
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:10.540]   Prayer without prayer, right, you can do as much Bible study as you want, you can do as
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.340]   much fellowship as you want, you can do as much exegesis and serving the church as you
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:21.340]   want, you cannot engage in the spiritual battle because we do not fight against flesh and
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.660]   blood.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.500]   Right?
[00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.260]   The devil is not afraid of theologically minded people.
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.860]   The devil does not draw back from people who are organized.
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.780]   Devil is not afraid of a church filled with people who are very gifted, have a lot of
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.300]   experience.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.380]   What is the devil afraid of?
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:48.780]   The devil is only afraid of one thing.
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.780]   What's the devil afraid of?
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.140]   God.
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.820]   There's nothing more powerful than him than God.
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.820]   Right?
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.580]   Satan was the highest of the angels.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.840]   So there's nothing that the devil is afraid of other than God himself.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.940]   So it is only when we are directly engaged with the things of God, right, all of these
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.420]   things are important, but prayer is the most direct thing that we can connect with God.
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.420]   Right?
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:18.620]   And that's why Jesus says when he sees the multitudes, first thing he says is what?
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.260]   He doesn't say, "Go raise more disciples."
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.260]   He doesn't say that.
[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.380]   He doesn't say, "Go train more people for leadership."
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.380]   He doesn't say that.
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.380]   What does he say?
[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.580]   "Beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out more workers."
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.820]   Right?
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.860]   Because ultimately only God can cause us to bear fruit.
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:37.900]   Right?
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.420]   So he says to pray, pray with Thanksgiving, praying at the same time for us.
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:48.340]   And again, so he calls us to pray and then what he asks us to pray for is directly related.
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:59.860]   Pray at the same time for us.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.020]   Who's the for us he's talking about?
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.260]   Paul and his companions, right?
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.300]   And he names it later on in chapter four.
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.020]   He gives all these lists of people that he's traveling with.
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.340]   We mentioned that in the beginning, right?
[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.740]   Paul's not a lone ranger walking around doing his work.
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.140]   There's a whole team of people.
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.860]   He just happened to be the captain.
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:17.860]   Right?
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.140]   And he says, "Pray for us that God will open to us a door for the Word."
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:26.020]   So Paul is not passively waiting.
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:30.460]   I know that there's this tension whenever we do church or evangelism or mission work,
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:35.140]   there's this tension between strategy and dependence on God.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.180]   Right?
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.900]   The Western church has a tendency to strategize everything.
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:41.900]   Right?
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:46.180]   If you're strategic enough and you use this kind of organization and if you have these
[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.580]   gifted people doing this, we would be more successful.
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.860]   And yet we are weak in prayer.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.860]   Right?
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:59.020]   And so what's lacking in the Western church is not more how-to books on how to do things
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.020]   because we are experts in that.
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.020]   Right?
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:07.740]   That, I mean, all the books on how to do church, how to disciple, how to teach, how to this,
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.740]   it's all coming from the Western community.
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:10.740]   Right?
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.580]   What we are weak in is connecting to the Holy Spirit.
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.580]   Right?
[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.580]   That's where we're weak in.
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.980]   The Western church is because they don't have the strategy, they have a tendency to be more
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.820]   reliant on prayer and fasting and coming to God.
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.820]   Right?
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:29.300]   Apostle Paul, did he have a strategy?
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.300]   This is systematic theology.
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.540]   Think about the big picture of how Paul did ministry.
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.740]   Did Paul have a strategy in his mind?
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.740]   Tell me some of Paul's strategy.
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:46.980]   Okay.
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.940]   It's clear that Paul's intention was to go to the synagogue.
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.980]   Why would he go to the synagogue first?
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:52.980]   Huh?
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:16:02.260]   Why would he go to the synagogue first?
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.140]   Because they had the gospel in the Old Testament.
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:11.180]   Even though the Holy Spirit made it very clear, "You are an apostle sent to the Gentiles,"
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.100]   even Paul had a hard time with that.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:17.620]   We can't read his mind, but it seems like Apostle Paul was so stuck on the Jews that
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:18.780]   it took him a while.
[00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:22.340]   It wasn't until he got rejected by the Jews, he started going to the Gentiles.
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.340]   Remember?
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.340]   Right?
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.500]   Even in Corinth and Athens, he went to the synagogues and then he got kicked out and
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.500]   went to the marketplace.
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.500]   Right?
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.140]   So, there is a strategy.
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:42.220]   And then, not only did he go to the synagogues, the cities that he went into, were they strategic?
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:55.940]   How was it strategic?
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.380]   They were all major cities.
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:03.380]   Have you ever, do you remember any city that we studied or, there might be one or two,
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.980]   but majority of the cities, it says it was a major city.
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.660]   It was a Roman occupied city.
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.540]   It was a major port city.
[00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.500]   Every single one of the cities that Paul targeted were major cities.
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.140]   He didn't go to little towns.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.220]   Why would he do that?
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.140]   Because that's where everybody was coming.
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:23.140]   There's a reason why people are going to Beijing to preach the gospel.
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.100]   Because that's where everybody is coming.
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.140]   Right?
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.700]   So, they would strategically target these big places.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.460]   So, I can go on and on, but did Paul have a strategy?
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:35.420]   At least, when you read it, it seems like Paul had strategies.
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.420]   Right?
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:41.380]   But, even though Paul had strategies and he was working, ultimately Paul knew that it
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.700]   wasn't the strategy that was causing him to bear fruit.
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:45.900]   Right?
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.580]   It wasn't like, "Oh, we did this and then," you know, there are times when the Holy Spirit
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.100]   says, "Don't go to Asia.
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.100]   Come up to Bithynia."
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.580]   And then he has a, somebody has a dream and then he crosses over to Macedonia.
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:18:01.180]   And so, Paul, in the midst of having plans, right, he didn't sit there and wait.
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.540]   The Holy Spirit didn't tell him not to go.
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.540]   Right?
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:05.940]   He wasn't just sitting there at home.
[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.020]   Well, God didn't call me.
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.020]   He called some people.
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.020]   He didn't call me.
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.020]   Right?
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.640]   He was in the context of moving and being obedient.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.460]   And within the context of his working, the Holy Spirit would guide him and lead him.
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.780]   Certain doors would shut and then he would end up going somewhere else.
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:24.340]   So, you can see his ministry was very fluid, but it was happening in the context of him
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.780]   being obedient.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:26.940]   Right?
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.940]   It was in the context of him sharing the gospel.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.740]   You know, one of the most frustrating things that I hear from people are people who are
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.940]   very critical about the way someone else is doing evangelism while they're sitting at
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.060]   home watching TV.
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.580]   Yeah.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.100]   That ticks me off, to be honest.
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.100]   Right?
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.820]   They're so critical about how other people are doing ministry while they're sitting home
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.820]   doing nothing.
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.820]   Right?
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.580]   So, even if you disagree, disagree in the context of you doing it.
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.580]   Right?
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:00.860]   While you're doing it, show people how you think it ought to be done, but don't sit there
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:04.540]   with your arms crossed and then criticize people who are actively going out there because
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.820]   you don't think they're doing it right.
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.180]   Right?
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.780]   Apostle Paul was actively engaged in ministry.
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.860]   It wasn't like he didn't have a strategy.
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.060]   So it's not that strategy doesn't matter.
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.420]   It's just that strategy isn't foundational.
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.420]   Right?
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.100]   Do we have strategy at the church?
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.100]   Of course we have strategy.
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.500]   How we organize our small group is very strategic.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.020]   Right?
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:32.740]   Like how, you know, where we plant, what people come, the age organization, all of these things
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.300]   are strategic.
[00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:38.100]   But in the end, what bears fruit is not the strategy.
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.840]   Right?
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:46.500]   He says, "Pray that the doors may be open to us, that the word may spread."
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.500]   Right?
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.540]   Paul's not saying so that we may spread, our brand of Christianity may spread, but
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.460]   he's eager to get the word out, that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ.
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:20:01.740]   So Paul is, Paul knows very clearly, right, what the heart of his message is, is to get
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.380]   the gospel out, to which I have been imprisoned.
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.660]   So again, he's not just passively waiting.
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:15.340]   Did he go to prison because he was a Christian?
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:21.060]   Now, there are periods in church history, and there are places in the world even now,
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:24.620]   that there is persecution just by being a Christian.
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:25.620]   Right?
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.300]   North Korea would be one of them.
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.740]   I mean, we heard about the bombing that took place in Sri Lanka.
[00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.860]   They got bombed because they were Christians.
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:34.860]   Right?
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:39.020]   But for majority of church history and majority of the places around the world, they're being
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:45.300]   persecuted and risking their lives, not because they're Christians, but because they're proselytizing.
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:51.260]   The Indian pastors in India can live a very peaceful life if they didn't proselytize,
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.700]   if they didn't go to the villages and try to preach the gospel.
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.100]   Paul was sitting in prison not because he claimed faith in Jesus Christ, but because
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.900]   he was trying to get other people to believe.
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.820]   He was risking his life going place to place.
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:08.220]   And then when he was very successful, he would actually turn even the economy upside down
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.840]   because they couldn't sell idols anymore.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.540]   People wouldn't go to the temple.
[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:17.100]   And so they couldn't make a living because of Paul was so successful in certain cities,
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.140]   Ephesus being one of them.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.140]   Right?
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.140]   That's why he was sitting in prison.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.500]   Because he was actively engaged.
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:29.860]   So oftentimes when people think, "Oh, how come we don't experience persecution here?"
[00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:35.380]   Well, persecution happens when we're engaged in the spiritual battle.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.540]   It may look different.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:41.940]   You may not be imprisoned or get rocks thrown at, but there will definitely be a pushback
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.660]   of some sort.
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:49.160]   But if you're not pushing toward the darkness, there's nothing to push back.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:54.660]   If you're sitting comfortably where you are, there's no need for them to push you back.
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:55.660]   Right?
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.140]   Paul's sitting in prison because he's actively engaged in the gospel ministry.
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:02.700]   And then he says his prayer is that not only that the doors may be open, when the doors
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.940]   open that he may make the gospel clear.
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:05.940]   Right?
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:11.140]   So in order to make the gospel clear, two things need to happen.
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:16.300]   One, you need to be clear about the gospel.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:20.420]   You can't be clear about the gospel if you're not clear about the gospel.
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.860]   If you're kind of nonchalantly just going through.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:29.900]   You know, I've met so many Christians who can't explain why Jesus had to die.
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.940]   And again, I don't mean to shame you here.
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.980]   And if you can't answer my question, it's a challenge.
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:42.060]   Is it important for Christians to be able to explain why Jesus had to die?
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:47.060]   Why couldn't he just say you're forgiven just like normal people?
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:53.340]   If somebody wronged me and you want my forgiveness, all I have to do is say, okay, I'm not gonna
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.340]   hold it against you.
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.340]   I forgive you.
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.340]   Right?
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.860]   Why doesn't God do that?
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.540]   Mankind sinned against him.
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:04.900]   Why does all this drama of crucifying his son and sin being upon him?
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.300]   Why does he do all that?
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.680]   I remember early on as a Christian, yeah, I couldn't understand that.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:15.740]   Even though I accepted it and I prayed and it's back in my mind, I didn't fully understand
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:16.900]   it.
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.500]   I just kind of like, oh, you know, let the theologians take care of it.
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.800]   They said it so it must be true.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.260]   But the more, the longer I became a Christian, the more it bothered me that I couldn't give
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.820]   it a precise answer for that or a satisfactory answer for that.
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:35.700]   And I realized like, hmm, I don't really know the gospel that well.
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.700]   Right?
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.500]   How important is it that you understand the concept of Colossians and what Paul says,
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.100]   why he says it, why is he on the cross?
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.740]   What is the nature of God?
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:45.740]   Right?
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:49.740]   How he created, what caused man to fall, what happened after the fall, what was the reason
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:54.580]   why we got saved, what happened after we got saved, what is coming because we got saved.
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:59.980]   How important is that as poor Christian?
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.380]   Really important.
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.380]   Right?
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:06.820]   If you own a home, you better learn how to pay your mortgage.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.020]   Right?
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.620]   If you own a home, there's, I mean, if you bought a house and you say, well, how'd you
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:12.620]   pay for it?
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:13.620]   I don't know.
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.820]   Where do you pay your bills?
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:15.820]   I don't know.
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:16.820]   Did you get a loan?
[00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:17.820]   I don't know.
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.340]   You're going to lose your house.
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.980]   You know what I mean?
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.700]   You can't, you can't own a home and not know about the mortgage.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.700]   Right?
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.740]   Assuming you're the one in charge.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.000]   Right?
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.440]   You can't profess to have faith in Christ and then live the rest of your life and not
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.460]   know the content of the gospel.
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.460]   Right?
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.880]   So if you want to make it clear first, you have to be, you have to be clear about the
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.640]   gospel and that's why we study the word of God.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.940]   We're trying to understand what we've already professed.
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:45.940]   Why did he do that?
[00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:51.700]   So somebody who is not evangelizing and sharing the gospel, you may feel comfortable being
[00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.940]   where you are because no one's ever challenging you.
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.180]   Right?
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:00.040]   A non-Christian isn't going to be like, "Wow, why, if God's so good, why did he do that?"
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.700]   No one is ever asking you because you're not ever engaged with non-Christians.
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:03.700]   Right?
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:09.440]   In fact, you don't even know what kind of holes exist in your understanding of the gospel
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.820]   because you're never being challenged.
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.700]   You're always surrounded by people who are trying to encourage you.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.100]   "Oh, I didn't do my quiet time this week."
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.100]   "Ah, it's okay.
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.100]   You know, we all struggle."
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.100]   Right?
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:24.720]   I mean, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, but if that's all you have around
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:30.020]   you all the time, right, constantly telling you that everything is okay no matter what
[00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:37.300]   it is, then 10, 20, 30 years go by, you still have no idea what you profess to believe.
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:42.140]   And all of a sudden, you get an aggressive atheist at work who's coming at you.
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:47.260]   20 years later, you realize, "Hmm, I don't know what I believe."
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:52.740]   And then because you don't know what you believe, you begin to think that maybe this isn't real.
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.400]   It just may be that you don't know.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.600]   Not that there isn't an answer for that.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.600]   Right?
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:03.800]   So, in order to make the gospel clear, you need to know what the gospel is in detail.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:10.560]   You need to be growing in understanding of what he did, why he did it, what did he accomplish
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.980]   at the cross, why was the shedding of blood, right?
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.520]   Why did he have to resurrect?
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.800]   Why did he have to be the son of God?
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:26.760]   What is the second part to make the gospel clear?
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.680]   You need to know the gospel.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:34.800]   What's the second thing that you need to do?
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.440]   It's not that complicated.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.820]   You need to open your mouth.
[00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:44.960]   You may know the gospel well, but if you don't open your mouth, it means nothing.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.960]   How can they know?
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.960]   Right?
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.960]   Doesn't Paul say that in Romans?
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.960]   Right?
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.800]   How can they hear if they do not preach?
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.840]   How can they preach if they're not sent?
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.840]   Right?
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:00.760]   So, you need to know, you need to know, and that's what we're doing here, right, in the
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.240]   end to really understand the depth of the gospel.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:08.300]   Every part of the Bible, Genesis to Revelation, is a revelation of the gospel about the mystery
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.300]   of Christ.
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.240]   And that's why we need to know every part of the Bible.
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:16.000]   Because it gives different aspects, right, of the gospel.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.360]   But the second part of it, if you may know it and you may appreciate it, you may worship
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.120]   God and be a great Christian in church, but if you never open your mouth, how will they
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.120]   know?
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.120]   Right?
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:29.680]   So, Paul says, "Pray for us that the door may be opened for the word, that the mystery
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.560]   of Christ may be made known."
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.380]   Make it clear, right?
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:39.520]   And then, thirdly, he says, "Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders."
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:45.720]   Now, this is not disconnected with what he just said about prayer, because his prayer
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.460]   was to make the gospel known.
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:53.840]   Now he's talking about how you ought to live in order to set up for the gospel, right?
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.240]   So it is related.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:01.220]   So all his prayer is, you need to pray to keep watch, to be thankful, right?
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:05.680]   And pray specifically for us that the door may be opened for us, that the gospel may
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.180]   be preached, you may be made clear.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:13.720]   But the way that you need to live where you are, right, toward outsiders, conduct yourselves
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:18.020]   with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of every opportunity.
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:23.080]   So what does he mean by making the most of every opportunity?
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:26.480]   Look for opportunities to get the gospel out, right?
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:30.240]   If you're going to make the gospel clear, you know the gospel, and you're ready, you're
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.960]   praying and you're ready to open your mouth, right?
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.360]   He says, "Why do you need wisdom?
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.000]   So that you can make a lot of money?
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Make a lot of friends?"
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.880]   What is he asking wisdom for?
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.300]   To be effective in preaching the gospel, right?
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.980]   He's not saying live wisely so that you can make good investments and make sure you pick
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:57.760]   the right stock so that they can go up and buy the house at the right time when it dips,
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:58.760]   right?
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.560]   Know which industry to go into that's booming and different.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:02.560]   Live with wisdom.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.560]   Is that what he's talking about?
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.920]   That's not what he's talking about.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:10.000]   In the context he's talking about, live with wisdom to make the most of every opportunity.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.880]   If God opens the door, right, but you're not sober, what happens?
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.320]   Nothing's going to happen.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:26.640]   You'd be surprised when you are prayerful and you are spiritually sober, just how many
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.280]   opportunities that are around you every single day for you to share the gospel that you just
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.600]   aren't even aware of, right?
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.280]   It's sometimes like, "Oh, you know, like Orange County, everybody knows, you know, like if
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:43.880]   I go to China where people don't know the gospel, I could," but you'd be surprised if
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:48.760]   you stayed alert, right, how often you run into, like when you go out to missions, right?
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:53.040]   Let's say you go to Japan and you prayed in the morning, "Hey, let's stay sober."
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:57.200]   You get into the subway and then say, "Hey, when you're in the subway, sit next to me,"
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.120]   assuming everybody speaks English, which they don't, but I'm just giving you an example,
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.120]   right?
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:08.320]   Every time you enter into the subway, that's a possibility to share the gospel, right?
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:13.120]   Everybody is lost and asking a question, that's an opportunity to share the gospel.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:18.800]   You're a student and you have other students sitting around and you're doing projects together,
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.080]   that's an opportunity to share the gospel.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.040]   You have non-Christian family members coming over, that's an opportunity to share the gospel,
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.040]   right?
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:31.520]   I mean, if you are sober and you are actively looking and praying, you'd be surprised just
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:36.680]   how often that opportunity actually happens, right?
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:42.520]   Hey, I have so many stories of me missing opportunities and I would only think about
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.360]   it after I would come out of that.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.280]   It's like, "Oh, shoot, I should have said something."
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.200]   Yeah, there's one time I was just so burnt out from ministry.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:56.160]   I got on this cruise by myself, okay?
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.160]   And I told the story before, but yeah, I was a weirdo.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:04.160]   I got on a cruise to Ensenada by myself and I didn't want to talk to anybody, you know,
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:07.960]   and then I would go to dinner by myself and they would say, "What are you doing here?"
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.520]   And I was like, "I'm just tired," you know?
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.840]   So I just didn't want to talk to anybody.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:19.600]   And I remember there was another older man who was there sitting and eating and I must
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:22.000]   have looked pretty pathetic and he was engaging with me.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.320]   And then for some reason, there was a lot of fires going on at that time.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.400]   There was a Malibu fire, there was a lot of earthquakes.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:32.680]   And then he wasn't a Christian and he asked me, he said, "Wow, you know, like something
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.520]   must be going on."
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.520]   That's what he said.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:40.680]   It's like all my years, he said 70-some years he lived, he said, "I've never seen this.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.400]   There's something going on."
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:49.920]   And I was just sitting there, it's like, "Yeah, there's a lot of fires."
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.240]   In the back of my mind, I knew like, okay, you know, like I could have just said, "You
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.440]   know what the Bible says about the end times?"
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.800]   And you know, and he was engaging me.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.440]   I live all my life trying to engage people and he was engaging me, but I was just so
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.440]   tired.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.760]   I didn't want to talk to anybody.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:11.680]   And I remember coming back to the room and even to this day, I think about that situation.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.960]   Because I pray for that kind of stuff to happen.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:19.000]   And then when the guy came to me, like trying to help me and I didn't want to talk to him
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.840]   because I was just so tired.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.160]   I don't want to talk about anything.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.440]   I just want to go back to my room.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.880]   I don't want to engage this guy.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:29.320]   And again, to this day, I think about that because that kind of stuff just doesn't happen.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.320]   Right?
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:35.080]   I mean, I traveled to India and remotest parts of the world to try to engage people about
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.560]   the gospel and this guy came to me.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:41.520]   But because I wasn't sober, I just didn't have the energy.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:47.080]   And so if we were, again, if we're engaged in prayer and we're remaining sober, you'd
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:52.600]   be surprised how often opportunities are around us.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.280]   So he prays that we would conduct ourselves to outsiders with wisdom, making the most
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.280]   of every opportunity.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.800]   And his speech, "Always be with grace as seasoned with salt."
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.080]   So again, what does salt mean?
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:07.480]   Jesus himself says that we are the salt of the earth.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:10.400]   Salt is used, one for flavor and the other was for what?
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.400]   Preservation.
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.400]   Right?
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:21.960]   So could Paul be saying, "Be salty, be flavorful."
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.760]   Make their dull food more flavorful by being around.
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:29.000]   Like they have more fun when you're there, possibly.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.560]   Maybe you could milk an illustration out of that, but it seems to fit more with the preservation.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:34.760]   Right?
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:39.880]   That we are the salt of the earth, that God put us to be a light and he's using us as
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.120]   an avenue to save the world.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.120]   Right?
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:48.680]   So he says, when he says, "To let your speech always be with grace as though seasoned with
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.800]   salt in preservation, so that you will know how you should respond to each person."
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:34:00.840]   In other words, the way you speak, right, in the context with the outsiders will either
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:05.920]   cause you to have an opportunity to share the gospel or may shut the door.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.000]   Right?
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.760]   As an example, if, and again, this is, you know, most of you guys are in the workforce,
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:16.560]   have at least experienced the workforce.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:21.720]   I've worked enough in the secular world to know that the common attitude most people
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:25.000]   have at work is disgruntled.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.840]   It doesn't matter where you are.
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:34.040]   In fact, it's almost weird if you went to a workplace and everybody was happy.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:38.720]   Find a new job and go there and don't do it the first week so you don't get fired.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.720]   Right?
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:43.200]   After a while, you get, you know, you get tenured and you feel comfortable there.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.520]   So what do you think about the boss?
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.760]   See what comes out of their mouth.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:54.120]   Typically, most people are disgruntled at work and they spend an enormous amount of
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:58.000]   time complaining about who's doing what wrong.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   That's usually the environment.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.440]   How many of you are in that kind of environment right now?
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:07.280]   Like, if you can be honest, maybe you're the one causing this.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.760]   How many of you are in that kind of environment right now where it's very toxic because people
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.320]   are always talking bad?
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.320]   Okay.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.360]   All right.
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:19.760]   There's enough of you, right?
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:23.800]   You be so...
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.560]   Oh.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:32.360]   This is specifically for you?
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.400]   Yes.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:39.240]   I'm not saying every worker is like that, but that's the general attitude most people
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.280]   have of workers.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.040]   They're disgruntled about something.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.840]   Whether they blame the boss, whether they blame other people, there's always some kind
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.520]   of drama going on.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:53.000]   If you jump into that and you're no different than them, and then all of a sudden they say,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   "You know what?
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.880]   Jesus died for me on the cross."
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:01.800]   See how serious they take you if that's what you're known for.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:06.280]   You're known for your disgruntle, your slandering, you're always saying this, you're always grumbling,
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:10.960]   and all of a sudden it's like, "But Jesus died for me."
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:15.240]   So when he says, "Make your speech seasoned with salt," right, so that you will know how
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:20.560]   you should respond to each person, again, it's to establish an opportunity, again, with
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:25.120]   your speech, when the opportunity comes, when God opens the door, that you can share the
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:29.800]   gospel with people and be wise about how you go about doing that.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.960]   You know, one of the best things that I learned about sharing the gospel is that you don't
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.960]   need to talk all the time, right?
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:40.640]   Because people want to be heard, most people, especially if they're hurting.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:45.600]   If they're hurting people, they don't want to hear a monologue from you, you know, because
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.600]   they're hurting.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.240]   You don't want somebody sitting in front of you saying, "Hey, you don't know, I know,
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:52.440]   you know, I know, I know, I know, you don't know, I know, I know."
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.600]   That's all they hear.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.640]   Like that's all they're hearing.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:01.140]   So one of the biggest things that I learned in evangelism is to hear them so that they
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.960]   feel like you know and you care.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:08.720]   If they think you care, they become far better listeners, right?
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:12.280]   If they don't think you care, they don't care what you say.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.080]   They don't care how well you say it, right?
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:20.160]   And so a lot of times like when we're evangelists and I'll sit there and he doesn't give me
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.240]   a single minute to talk.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.120]   And I used to feel like, "Oh, I got to get the gospel out, you know?
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.560]   I got to stick it in there somewhere."
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:30.920]   And I would force it in them and then I said it and they're like, "Oh, I shared the gospel
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.920]   today."
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.920]   But I realized that a lot of times like I don't have to share, you know, because that's
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.640]   why it's like we're praying for opportunity to be wise.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:42.320]   If I go out there and engage and I'll tell them I'm a Christian, they know why I'm there.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:47.680]   And even the one sentence I say in the context of them listening, there's far more, there's
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.800]   far more fruit than trying to shove the whole gospel into somebody who's not listening,
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:52.800]   right?
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.560]   So oftentimes you'll be sitting there talking to a non-Christian and he doesn't give you
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.800]   an opportunity to talk.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.160]   That's okay.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.840]   You're engaging in them, right?
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:07.120]   But maybe, maybe in the context of talking, he's like, "Man, I've talked for two hours
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:08.120]   straight.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.120]   I haven't asked a single question."
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.800]   So what do you do?
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:16.400]   That 10 minute or five minute window he gives you will be far more effective than the hour
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.480]   of trying to shove it down his throat.
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:22.600]   So that's why you need to be wise.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:27.120]   Be wise, be prayerful, be watchful, look for the opportunities that are coming your way.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.720]   Again, if you're not sober, even in the opportunities come, you're not even going to, you're not
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.720]   going to be aware of it.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.480]   But if you're sober and you're aware, you'd be surprised.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.720]   Every question they ask you, every interest that they have in you can easily turn into
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.440]   the gospel, right?
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.440]   What do you like to do?
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:46.960]   I like to go to church.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.000]   Where do you go to eat?
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.720]   I usually go out with my friends after Bible study.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:57.440]   Every question could turn into a connection to something that you do related to Christ,
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.000]   if you're sober.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.520]   But if you're not sober, it's like, what's the most important thing to you?
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.360]   It's the playoff right now.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.200]   I really wish the Spurs would win.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:11.560]   Now you're having a whole conversation about what's going on in NBA playoff because you're
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.760]   not sober.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:17.560]   And then way later, you're thinking like, oh shoot, he asked me what was most important
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.800]   to me and I told him it was basketball.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.400]   Because we weren't sober.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:27.680]   So the whole thing that he's saying here, again, it's in the context of planting churches
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:34.640]   and spreading the gospel, to be prayerful, to be watchful, with thanksgiving, pray for
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:41.280]   the doors to open, pray that when the doors do open that he may be able to preach it clearly.
[00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:44.280]   In order to do that, make sure that you're staying sober.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.720]   You're living in such a way that you're being wise among non-Christians so that when that
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:51.760]   opportunity comes, you're ready.
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:40:00.880]   So along with that, at the end, some of the questions.
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:01.880]   How is your prayer life?
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:06.720]   In what way can you be more deliberate in your prayer life this week?
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:11.520]   No matter where you are in your walk with God, in your prayer life, this is asking for
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:15.480]   specific application and you don't have to be like, oh I'm going to pray an hour a day,
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.400]   I'm going to pray in the morning, I'm going to pray at night.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:22.160]   But wherever you are, to be a bit more deliberate.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.280]   Prayer is one of those things that if you don't make an appointment, it's probably not
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.960]   going to happen.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.280]   If you don't make an appointment, it's like, oh when I get up I'm going to do it.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:35.240]   I don't know about you, but when I get up I'm not in the mood to pray.
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.240]   Sometimes I pray.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.880]   I'm not in the mood to pray.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:41.640]   Because I'm tired, I'm thinking about getting dressed, I'm thinking about all the appointments
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.160]   and different things I have to do.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.640]   So if I don't tell myself I'm going to come to the office and I'm going to sit there and
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.440]   I'm going to pray for these things, it just doesn't happen.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.900]   Or it kind of happens sometimes, it kind of doesn't happen.
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.560]   So how can you be more deliberate about praying?
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:00.120]   So if your prayer life kind of looks like this, when it happens, it happens, doesn't
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:02.220]   happen, doesn't happen, right?
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:03.920]   How can you be more deliberate this week?
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.320]   Just even if it's ten minutes, when you get in the car in the morning, or when you get
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.120]   into the work a little bit earlier, you're going to pray.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.280]   Or before you leave and get in your car, I'm going to pray a little bit and I'm going to
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.280]   pray for these things.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:17.800]   So if you're going to make an appointment to pray, prepare for prayer.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.880]   Don't just get in there and I'm going to pray.
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:23.880]   Already think in your mind or even write down, this is what I'm going to pray for.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:29.360]   I'm going to pray for these people, I'm going to pray for this situation, and write down
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.940]   two or three things that you're going to pray for that day.
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.520]   That will help you to get there and do that.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.120]   Because if you don't do that, you're going to say, well, you know, I'm going to pray,
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.520]   it's important for me to pray.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:42.920]   Like at what point in your life, especially if you're busy, if you're a young parent with
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.520]   children, at what point do you get thirty minute or ten minute, twenty minute break
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.720]   where you're doing nothing?
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.160]   Zero.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:55.200]   If you have young children at home, there is no such thing as break.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.640]   Break is when you close your eyes and go to sleep.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:04.520]   So if you're not deliberate about appointing that time, it's probably not going to happen.
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.040]   So that's that question, how can you be more deliberate?
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:10.360]   What aspect of the gospel do you need more clarity in?
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:14.520]   I told you in the beginning, I had a hard time understanding why the cross itself had
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.520]   to happen.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:23.000]   Because what part of the gospel is kind of vague that you should kind of really dig and
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.120]   really try to get a reasonable answer to.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.240]   If there is anything like that, which I know everybody does.
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:33.400]   Who are the non-Christians in your life that you have been praying for?
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.180]   And even if you haven't been praying for, that you should be praying for.
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:37.680]   So take some time to share that with your group.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:41.400]   And in what way can you be more deliberate in sharing the gospel with them?
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.720]   Don't say Tuesday, I'm going to lay out the Romans road.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.720]   Right?
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.960]   In the five minute break.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:52.040]   Something more reasonable with wisdom.
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.280]   Take them out to lunch.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:58.360]   If you haven't talked to this guy ever, and the first conversation is, if you don't believe
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.380]   in Jesus, right?
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:06.000]   So maybe if you haven't connected with him, just take him out to lunch.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.080]   Or just hang around them more.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:15.280]   But how can you be more deliberate about reaching out to them?
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:19.920]   You know, I was really thankful this Easter Sunday.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:26.400]   I think we had more non-Christians come to church this Sunday than we've ever.
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:32.720]   I don't know the exact number, but off the top of my head, we probably had 30 or more.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.720]   More than 30.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.400]   30 is the number that I kind of like off the top of my head.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.160]   But that's not including the people that I don't know, that I haven't talked to.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.160]   Right?
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:44.000]   So that's really encouraging, because a lot of people made an effort to reach out to their
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.320]   non-Christian friends.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.320]   Right?
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:50.440]   So whether that leads to further conversations, or them accepting Christ or not, but at least
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:55.680]   it shows me that a good number of our church people are being deliberate about being intentional
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.680]   with non-Christians.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.240]   So if that's something that, again, that you are already engaged in, take some time to
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.240]   pray.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:05.600]   If not, maybe this can be a catalyst for you to be mindful of them and pray for them.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:06.600]   Okay?
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:13.600]   So I'll close, and I'll have you guys get into your small room.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:17.200]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your living word.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:24.400]   We thank you that you are gracious with us, that you use weak vessels like us to spread
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.640]   such an important message of the cross.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:32.600]   We thank you that you didn't leave it up to us, that ultimately, Lord, that salvation
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:34.460]   is in your hands.
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:40.600]   Help us, Lord, to share, pray with confidence that, as you called us to be faithful, that
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.200]   nothing that we do is in vain in you.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.320]   So we pray for your blessing over our small group time.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.320]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:46.320]   Amen.
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.140]   Amen.
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:50.180]   (silence)
