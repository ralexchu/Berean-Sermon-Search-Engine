[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   It's good to be back.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.720]   We came here like around two Sundays ago and it's been pretty good to just hang out with
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.160]   family and reconnect with some good friends.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.640]   And yeah, we've been tremendously blessed and been encouraged by all the love and support
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.120]   that we've received so far.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.720]   And so yeah, my name is Alex.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.440]   We moved out to China, Beijing about almost two years ago.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.360]   And so it's only been a year and 10 months, but it feels a lot longer.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.120]   I'm still thinking, I'm like, did things change in Berlin?
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.960]   And I'm like, the only thing that really changed are just people's faces.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.320]   I mean, that's not an insult or anything like that.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.520]   But I mean, people got added to the congregation.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.880]   I think that's what I meant.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.920]   So but yeah, it's an honor, it's a privilege to be able to come back and to share with
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.840]   you what God has been doing through our family during our time out in Beijing.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.040]   I was kind of conflicted about how to present this information.
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.640]   I was like, is it a sermon?
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.120]   Is it a mission report?
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.120]   What is it?
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.480]   And I'm going to give a mixture of both.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.280]   And so what I'm going to share with you this morning isn't going to be like everything
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.520]   that's been going on in China over the past year and 10 months.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.860]   It's just a small snippet of it.
[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.400]   If you want to know more information or if you want to just find out what else God is
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.120]   doing over there, feel free to ask.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.400]   We'll be here until February 10th and then we'll be going back to Beijing, also known
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.920]   as the capital of China and the most polluted city in the world.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.280]   But anyways, just kidding.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.480]   Let's look at the text this morning.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.000]   I'll read it again and then we'll pray and we'll get started.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.320]   Mark chapter seven verses 24 to 30.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.760]   Mark chapter seven verses 24 through 30.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:25.160]   It says, "And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon and he
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.160]   entered a house.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.080]   He did not want anyone to know, yet he could not be hidden.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.680]   But immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.960]   and fell down at his feet.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:44.480]   Now the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophoenician by birth, and she begged him to cast the demon
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.480]   out of her daughter.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.100]   And he said to her, 'Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children's
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.560]   bread and throw it to the dogs.'
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.160]   But she answered him, 'Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.160]   crumbs.'
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.440]   And he said to her, 'For this statement, you may go your way.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.120]   The demon has left your daughter.'
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.440]   And she went home and found the child lying in bed and the demon gone."
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.080]   Let's pray.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.200]   Lord God, we want to continually saturate our service in prayer to you, asking for your
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.080]   help, asking for your presence to be here with us as we hear from your word this morning.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.600]   Lord God, none of us would be here if it wasn't for your grace to come to pursue us, to save
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.800]   us, to redeem us, to open the eyes of our heart, to see how sinful we are and how much
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.920]   we are in need of a savior.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.440]   God, would you please help us this morning as we hear from your word.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.280]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.000]   So in China, we've been going through the Gospel of Mark for our Bible study.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.640]   We meet weekly for this Bible study, and we just concluded the Gospel of Mark.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.400]   It took 36 weeks.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.800]   It was about a four-month hiatus for various reasons.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.200]   But it took us a long time, but it was good.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.360]   And what I want to share with you is from this passage, and again, I'm just trying to
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:23.880]   weave in together various things, experiences that we went through to just report back to
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.560]   you guys how our family has been doing overseas.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.800]   So we notice here in verse 24, it says, "And from there he arose and went away to the region
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.080]   of Tyre and Sidon."
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.240]   Now, if you have to know this, Tyre and Sidon is a Gentile region, okay?
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.300]   And so primarily Jesus has been doing ministry in Israel.
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.320]   And so for him to go out of his way to enter into this Gentile territory is sort of alarming
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.440]   for the disciples who are following him.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.480]   They're wondering, "Why are you going to this region, this Gentile region?"
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.800]   And it says pretty clearly why he goes, if you read the next sentence there.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.960]   It says, "And he entered a house and did not want anyone to know."
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.000]   So what we could observe from this context is that he just simply wants some privacy,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.480]   perhaps some rest.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.720]   If you guys have read through the Gospels, you know Jesus is very busy.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.120]   I taught this book a long time ago here at Berean.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.880]   And so if you know one of the key nicknames or summary phrases for the Gospel of Mark
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.640]   is the "Go Gospel," right?
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:35.320]   I mean, Jesus is going everywhere, doing things, teaching, performing miracles.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.720]   And so there's a good chance that he left Israel for a bit in order to get some rest.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.520]   However, we know that that's not the case, right?
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.360]   Because we see here, it says in the next phrase, "Yet he could not be hidden."
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.840]   Now who can be hidden from?
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.360]   We look at verse 25 here.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.880]   "But immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.040]   and fell down at his feet."
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.480]   In China, family matters a lot, right?
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.540]   Community matters a lot.
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:17.200]   More so than here in America, where in America we tend to have this individual, individuality
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.320]   that we want to express in ourselves.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.500]   But in China, family is really important.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.360]   If you're not part of the family, then you're not going to get any of the benefits.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:33.400]   If you're not part of this certain community, you're almost like, you're almost ignored.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.720]   And that's what we kind of see here with this woman, with her daughter.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.760]   She cares about her daughter.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:45.320]   This wasn't some internal illness that's causing suffering to her, to this daughter that she
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.920]   gave birth to and loved, right?
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:55.140]   This is an external factor that's causing her much grief and much pain and it's moving
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.460]   this mother to seek after Jesus.
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:05.100]   The Jesus who is seeking to be hidden and yet she finds him.
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.380]   In China, again, like I said before, family is very important.
[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.180]   Community is, family typically is the reason why a lot of people do not profess faith in
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.520]   Jesus Christ.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.100]   They're thinking, if I go out in faith, if I accept Jesus Christ, what happens to my
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.100]   family?
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.420]   Do I not spend time with them anymore?
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.300]   How will they be supported?
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.700]   How will my faith affect them?
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.420]   Will they disown me if I profess faith?
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.860]   And those are stark realities that do happen.
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:48.700]   However, it was very important for me, especially in talking to a guy in our Bible study, he's
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.860]   a non-believer, because he was expressing these concerns to me.
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.780]   He was just saying, "Alex, I don't know.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.220]   I have a family.
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:03.100]   I'm not married yet, but if I become a Christian, I feel like that's going to be a hurdle to
[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.500]   everything."
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.820]   I think for me, the thing that I had to share with him is that though you are entering the
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:16.260]   family of God, though you are alone making this decision, it's really important for you
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:21.060]   to recognize that you're not just leaving a family and going off by yourself into an
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.260]   island.
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.940]   It's important for you to recognize that you are coming out of a family and entering into
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.980]   a new family.
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.180]   And I think that for me is something that kind of brings out in verse 25 here, just
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:41.220]   how important family is, how important community is, how much the woman who loved her daughter
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:46.300]   so much that she was willing to go out of her bounds to seek after this man named Jesus
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:53.620]   Christ to heal her daughter from this unclean spirit.
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.540]   Now again, family is so important.
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.220]   Family is always a reminder for us as well.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:04.360]   Joe, I mean, the pollution over there is kind of like a running topic.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.620]   We always talk about it.
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:09.320]   There's like an app that you can get on your phone to find out what is the air quality
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.620]   level for the day.
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:17.100]   And it gives you a seven day prediction too, so you can like space out your misery.
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.140]   You're like, "Oh, there's a brief reprieve.
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.700]   Oh, Wednesday, okay, we're going to do something that day.
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.700]   But oh, Thursday, oof."
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:33.980]   And I think being single, it would have been a lot easier to handle that, but it's hard
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.260]   with your family being there.
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.300]   It's hard to see, you know, like obviously we're here now and like we're going out every
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.300]   day.
[00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.780]   I'm not that kind of person.
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.780]   I get tired a lot.
[00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.420]   I get tired of being out.
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:52.100]   But I see my son, I see, you know, Hadden, I see Ryle, and they're just, well, not Ryle,
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.300]   but at least Hadden is enjoying life, just running around and, you know, just doing,
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.540]   just enjoying the outdoors.
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:08.700]   So when we go back, right, when we go back, my family serves me, serves me as a reminder
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.260]   that, yeah, there's a sacrifice that had to be made, right?
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.760]   There had to be a sacrifice to be made in order for us to be out there, to participate
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.220]   in his work, to participate in his kingdom.
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:28.340]   And so in understanding how important family is, it became a great witnessing tool to a
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.780]   lot of people that we've met.
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.980]   There's people who look at us and like, we're trying to get to America.
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.640]   You know, we're trying to get to America so our family will have a better life, but you're
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.180]   coming to China and you're settling down with your family.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.780]   Like why?
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.180]   And I'm like, yeah, you're right.
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.980]   Yeah, America would be a lot easier.
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.180]   America would be a lot better.
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.700]   Yeah, I see your point.
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.660]   And ultimately it just becomes a great witnessing tool, right?
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.980]   It's a great witnessing tool for them to see like, I'm not coming to China because I want
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.620]   to experience culture.
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:10.020]   I'm not coming to China because I love the food.
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.700]   I'm coming to China because people need to hear about the love of Jesus Christ in the
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.180]   gospel, right?
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:21.020]   People need to know that there is sin that needs to be forgiven.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:26.260]   And the only way to be forgiven of that sin is in Jesus Christ.
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.180]   And so there's people that I've met recently.
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.260]   There's connections that I made with people that I made 10 years ago when I first lived
[00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.500]   out in Beijing.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:41.820]   And the ability to be able to share with them in light of bringing my family along has only
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:46.280]   really strengthened the witness of the gospel to them.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:51.480]   And so that's my first observation is just how important family is and how much this
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.900]   woman loves this little daughter to the point where she wants to get this unclean spirit
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:02.040]   out of her and is willing to seek out this man, Jesus Christ.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:08.960]   Now in verse 26 we see that Mark gives us a description about this mother.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:16.240]   Now the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophoenician by birth.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:22.920]   The reason why Mark adds this detail for us is because he wants to communicate to us that
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:27.640]   one, she's a woman, clearly, right?
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:33.240]   And if we know anything from the culture back then, women were considered second class citizens.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.200]   They had no rights, right?
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.360]   They were treated like property, okay?
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.800]   On top of that, Mark knows that she's a Gentile.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.800]   And in the eyes of the Jews, Gentiles were also viewed as second class citizens, right?
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.560]   So we're talking about second class of second class, right?
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.560]   Almost like the bottom of the totem pole here.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.000]   But it gets even worse.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.560]   Mark notes that she is a Syrophoenician, which means she's from the nation of Syria.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.720]   And if you just kind of go over through the Old Testament and kind of go over the conquests,
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.120]   you'll see that Syria has popped up oftentimes as an enemy of Israel.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.760]   Okay, so you got the bottom of the bottom of the bottom.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:28.800]   This woman really has no right, no relationship to come and approach Jesus for help.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:34.600]   Oftentimes when you're out in China, you come across people that you really don't gel with,
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.600]   right?
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.720]   They have personality quirks, they have cultural quirks.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.640]   Yeah, a little different quirks that kind of like rub you the wrong way.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.400]   Sometimes they like to get up close and personal to you and you're just kind of like, "Hey
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.760]   man, I need my personal space."
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:57.880]   The smells, yes, the smells there that can be very unique and wake you up in the morning.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.240]   It's all there, you know?
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:07.320]   And yet, when I think about moving out to China, we moved out to China not because we
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.840]   want to reach out to people that we like, right?
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:17.520]   We want to reach out to people that really come out of our comfort zone, right?
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:27.240]   One example that I want to share with you guys is when we first moved to our first apartment,
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.840]   I know some people on our team wanted to go visit an English corner.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.080]   An English corner is just like a gathering of people where they just practice spoken
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.080]   English.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.320]   Typically, there's like a presentation by a foreigner and then they kind of like break
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:47.280]   off into groups and do like this little, this small group discussion and stuff like that.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.920]   So I said, "Okay, I found out this English corner, we're going to go there."
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:56.680]   First night, first Monday night that we're there, we go to this English corner and I
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:01.880]   go in there with the intention to be just hidden and not be seen, but they play an icebreaker
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.960]   game and I was too loud and I got too much attention.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.360]   So people started noticing me.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.920]   So I'm like, "All right, sweet."
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:15.040]   And obviously during the discussion time, there was this older guy coming up to me and
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.600]   he's just, you know, his English is pretty good.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.080]   And he's just like, "We're just talking."
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:26.040]   And he's asking me questions and I'm like, and he's like, "Oh, so what do you do?"
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.840]   And I'm like, "Oh," I can't tell him I was a P or a pastor.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.320]   I'm like, "Yeah, I'm an English teacher."
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.320]   "Oh really?
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.320]   Okay, what school do you go to?"
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.560]   I'm like, "Oh, you know, I teach over there somewhere in the corner."
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.880]   He's like, "Oh, okay."
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.600]   You know, because I don't know the exact address.
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.640]   So it's just kind of like we're kind of asking each other questions and I'm like, "Man, you're
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.640]   a really nice guy, man."
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.800]   I'm like, and we're meeting at a church and so I was like, "Hey, so are you a Christian?"
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.800]   He's like, "Oh, no, I'm not."
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.520]   And I'm like, "Oh, okay."
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.440]   And so he turns around and asked me, "Are you a Christian?"
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:06.960]   And I was like pretty close to saying like, "I'm a pastor," but you know, I ended up just
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.960]   changing my mind.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.960]   So I said, "Yeah, I'm a Christian."
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.200]   He's like, "Oh, okay, that's cool."
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.480]   The next day we exchanged phone numbers.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:21.000]   So not to like sound all freaky, but he calls me and he's like, "Hey, what's up, man?"
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.160]   And he's like, "Oh, like, I just want to like, I just want to call you and say thank you
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.440]   for being so open and honest with me."
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.920]   I'm like, "Yeah, sure."
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:34.240]   You know, he's like, "Yeah, I want to be open and honest with you because oftentimes when
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:38.280]   I tell people what I actually do for a living, they want to like hide away from me, you know,
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.280]   don't want to be my friend."
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.880]   And I'm like, "I think I know where this is going."
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:49.000]   And he's like, "Yeah, you know, I work for the government, you know."
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.720]   And I'm just like, "My first English corner.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.720]   No."
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.760]   I'm like, "God, why?"
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.980]   I'm just reaching out to people outside my comfort zone.
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:11.840]   You really moved me out of the comfort zone."
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:18.440]   And so basically for the next year, I avoided that English corner.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:24.200]   I was, he would call me periodically just to check in on me and stuff like that.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:29.400]   As a, I think as a friend.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:34.880]   Would run into me, would run into him at other English corners, you know.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.880]   And he was self-taught.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.080]   And his English was actually pretty good.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.600]   And I'm like, "Wow, you actually taught yourself."
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:45.120]   And he's just going to his English corners, practicing English.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:52.620]   About I would say five or six weeks ago, somewhere in mid-December, he actually came to our English
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.400]   corner for the first time.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.400]   He didn't know it existed.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.760]   I was very purposeful about that.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.200]   And there was this great fear in me because of this information that I know.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.520]   And he was just out of my comfort zone.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.800]   Like it's odd.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.880]   It's weird.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.920]   But I got a lot of encouragement from other people who live there.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.360]   And they're saying, "You know what, man?
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.960]   You shouldn't be afraid of this.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.480]   Why don't you just go up to him and just share?"
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.800]   And I'm like, "Are you crazy?"
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.080]   But when I sat down and started thinking about it, what was there to be afraid?
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.600]   What was I to be afraid of?
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.720]   You know?
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:39.280]   He's just a guy trying to learn English who happens to work for the government.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.200]   Is there anything wrong with that?
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.200]   No.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.320]   Is there any way that I could be in danger by sharing with him?
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.080]   No.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.080]   God brings…
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.680]   See, when we think about evangelism, sometimes we think about, "Oh, I want to evangelize
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.500]   to people that I'm comfortable with.
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.960]   People that are in my circle of influence.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.760]   My friends, my family."
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.760]   That's great.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.760]   I think we should do that.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.720]   But one of the things that, as I'm learning out there, is that, yeah, God will bring people
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.240]   into your life that is just outside of your comfort zone.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.880]   And you have to go out and reach out to them.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:18.320]   To be that gospel witness to that person.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.080]   And so that's what this woman represents here.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:27.840]   She is the lowest of the lows when it comes to society and their totem pole.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:31.840]   When it comes to level of priority, she's at the bottom of it.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:37.440]   And yet, she chooses to pursue Christ.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.400]   That man, I'm praying one of these days when I go back.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.880]   I will give him a call.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.760]   And I'll say, "Hey, I got some free time now.
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:50.360]   Yeah, I was dodging you for a year, okay?
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.360]   But let's grab some tea.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.360]   And let's talk."
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:20:01.200]   Yeah, I really got used to tea when I'm out there.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.200]   But that's something that, at least for me, one thing I kept on learning is that, yeah,
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.880]   God will bring people into your life that will challenge you to go out of your comfort
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.880]   zone.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:17.720]   Now, this woman has been identified as a Gentile, as a Syrophoenician by birth.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:24.720]   And it says, Mark notes, that she begged Jesus to cast a demon out of her daughter.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.640]   I mean, wouldn't you?
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.880]   If you had kids, right?
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.960]   And you were presented in this scenario where there's a demon possessed, you're a demon
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.640]   possessed child.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.960]   And Jesus is the only answer.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.040]   Wouldn't you beg?
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.160]   There'll be no jokes, no qualms.
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:47.760]   It's just like, I have a single purpose in coming to you, Jesus.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.120]   Save my daughter.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:54.560]   And yet Jesus answers back to her in verse 27.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:21:01.860]   And he said to her, "Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children's
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.640]   bread and throw it to the dogs."
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.640]   What?
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:15.400]   Jesus, like, I just asked you to cast this demon out of my daughter.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.400]   Right?
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.720]   Like, what are you getting at here?
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.780]   Is this a yes or a no?
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:27.240]   Why are you telling me this proverb about, "Let the children be fed first, for it is
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.740]   not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs"?
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:37.620]   What this proverb is trying to explain to the woman is that the promises of the Messiah,
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:43.380]   the blessings that are to come from God, is to go through Israel first, and then to the
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.380]   Gentiles.
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:52.020]   So it's in a way where Jesus is trying to inform her, "Your time is not here yet."
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.020]   Okay?
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:58.620]   "Your time is not here yet for me to bless you with."
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.900]   And sometimes we're looking at this and you're like, "Man, Jesus, that's messed up.
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.900]   Why would you do that?"
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:11.420]   Well, as we see later on in the text, and we can see later, you can see multiple times
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:18.460]   throughout the Gospels, and this is like my third point here.
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:24.660]   Jesus is focused on making faith the priority.
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.040]   Right?
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:32.460]   Jesus wasn't just going to heal the daughter and then the mother's just going to leave.
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.980]   Right?
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:39.980]   Jesus is more concerned about the faith of this Syrophoenician woman.
[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.320]   Right?
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.120]   It's one thing to just get everything handed to you.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:50.220]   It's another thing to actually struggle with something and then to receive it.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.760]   Right?
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:55.460]   Faith is the priority.
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:23:03.780]   Often times with the people that we are just connected with and we try to encourage, that
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:08.140]   seems to be the main piece of advice that I'm always passing off.
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.540]   Where is your faith?
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.540]   Where is your faith?
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:22.100]   There is one individual that I could think of and yeah, she's in her mid-30s, she's in
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:29.820]   the middle of a career change, she's single and so with Chinese New Year coming up, she's
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:30.820]   going to get pressured.
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:36.380]   What are you doing with your life?
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.620]   And she was going on and on and on.
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:42.020]   This is like multiple times where I've talked to her about this.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:45.420]   And in the end, it was just like, it comes down to faith.
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.420]   Where is your faith in all this?
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:52.640]   Is Jesus still your Lord and Savior?
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:59.180]   Is your salvation precious enough to be able to withstand all of these pressures?
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:05.140]   Yeah, Jesus could answer all of those requests really fast.
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.140]   Find you a job?
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.140]   Fine.
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:09.900]   Give you a husband?
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:10.900]   Fine.
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.280]   You know?
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.200]   But is that what Jesus is about?
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.540]   Is that why you profess faith in the first place?
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.540]   And she's just like, no.
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.520]   And I'm like, exactly.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:30.640]   You got to remember what your faith is based upon.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.820]   You made this decision to believe not because Jesus is going to give you a husband and a
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:38.300]   career and a family.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:43.020]   You chose to profess faith in Jesus because He redeemed your soul.
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.520]   Your sins have been forgiven.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:51.740]   You no longer live for the world, but you live for Christ.
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:56.240]   That's what Jesus is trying to get at here with this Syrophoenician woman.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:01.700]   Not to say no to her and be like, yeah, you know, I'm on my break right now.
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.220]   So you need to take a back seat.
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:09.000]   Oh, Jesus' love is so much deeper than that.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:17.260]   He wants her to profess faith, to profess faith in a way that will make this exchange,
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:24.440]   this conversation that Jesus is having so much more memorable.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.840]   Life changing, in fact.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:37.200]   Now we see in verse 28 here, after making this statement, this woman understands what
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:42.800]   Jesus is saying, but instead of taking it as a no and just turning around and just walking
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:51.480]   away, she says, but she answered him, yes, Lord, you're right.
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.560]   Israel is supposed to get the blessing first.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:03.720]   Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.640]   Jesus replies back to her saying, for this statement, you may go your way.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.520]   The demon has left her daughter.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:15.020]   And she went home and found the child lying in bed and the demon gone.
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.200]   So what just took place there, right?
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:24.920]   I think the main takeaway from these two verses here is that this Syrophoenician woman persisted
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.800]   in her faith.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:34.400]   She did not allow Jesus, did not allow this proverb to prevent her from asking Jesus again,
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.880]   you need to help me.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.240]   Yes, I know I'm a Gentile.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:44.120]   Yes, I know I'm a Syrophoenician.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:48.480]   I'm not supposed to be here.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:54.360]   But please, even the dogs take the crumbs off the children's table.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:59.840]   And this is just an expression of tremendous, tremendous humility on her part to be able
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:09.000]   to say that, to stay there and to persist.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.960]   Persistent faith.
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:22.040]   Over the last year and 10 months, this is probably an area where it has really just
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:28.240]   became really clear that I need to pursue and to really work on.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:36.480]   Obviously, being in a nation where counterfeits happen and the temptation to just compromise
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:47.640]   is there left and right, I realized that as for me and for our family, there is a need
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:56.320]   for us to remain holy in our living, to be spirit-filled in our interaction with others,
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:05.300]   and to persist in that, to pursue that persistent faith.
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:10.440]   And what this woman expresses here, just the humility to come before Jesus and continually
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.920]   ask Him, is something that really stood out to me.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.640]   Turn with me to 2 Peter 1.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.040]   2 Peter 1.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:26.560]   And again, this is something that was really, it really got my attention.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.280]   I was meditating on it for a while.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:41.200]   But 2 Peter 1, verses 3-8, when it comes to faith and persisting in it, 2 Peter 1, verses
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.080]   3-8, I'll just read it really quick.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:49.640]   His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:53.600]   the knowledge of Him who called us to His own glory and excellence, by which He has
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:59.960]   granted to us by His precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:05.020]   partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.960]   of sinful desire.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:12.440]   For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:17.760]   with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:28.120]   with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:33.820]   I was meditating on this because for me, it was, I understood, okay, my faith matters
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:37.200]   a lot while living in China.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.160]   It makes me stand out.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.240]   Opportunities come left and right.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:51.840]   And so, verse 5, it says, "For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith."
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.560]   Supplement your faith, make every effort.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.040]   I'm like, "Whew, that's a lot of doing.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.560]   Where do I get virtue?
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.160]   What about knowledge?
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:04.520]   Okay, knowledge, read books, got it.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:10.040]   Self-control, steadfastness, godliness, brotherly affection, and love.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.300]   That is a tall task.
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:17.440]   Make every effort to supplement your faith.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:22.080]   And I'm sitting there and I'm thinking, "How do I do this?"
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:27.400]   But if you just go back to verse 3, if you just go back to verse 3, it simply states,
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:36.840]   "His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness."
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:44.780]   All things pertaining to life and godliness has already been granted to His people.
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.440]   My son loves to eat.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.960]   Haddon, you know, he loves to eat.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:54.920]   He knows anything in the fridge that's not red, because he doesn't like spicy food,
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.840]   he can eat.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.800]   And so there's some mornings he just goes, like, "I'm tired, Jen's tired," and he just
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.180]   goes to the fridge and finds something to eat.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:11.560]   One time he found French toast and he just busts out the fridge and sat down, popped
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:15.280]   open Tupperware, and just started eating French toast.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.280]   To our shock.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:21.200]   Now Haddon knows.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.240]   My son knows.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.640]   Anything in the house that he wants to eat, yeah, it's his.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.640]   He can eat it.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.400]   It's been granted to him to eat.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:33.680]   But there are certain snacks, certain foods that he cannot reach.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:38.840]   One because physically he's just short and he can't reach that high, or it's locked behind
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:45.160]   a door, probably on purpose why it's locked.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.200]   And so what does he do?
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:52.640]   Does he make every effort to try to open that door and try to open the lock?
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.360]   No.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.640]   He just asks.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:06.120]   He comes to me, he comes to Jen, and says, "Can you open the door so I can get some snacks?"
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:12.060]   When I think about this passage and the need for persistent faith and all these things
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:17.360]   that we are called to make every effort to supplement our faith with, it's already been
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.000]   granted to us.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.800]   So how do we apply that then?
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.160]   We just have to ask.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.400]   Come before God.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.120]   Ask Him for help.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:33.360]   To pray a genuine prayer saying, "God, I can't do this on my own.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:39.780]   Please supplement my faith so I can live for You.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:44.600]   So that it will keep me," as verse 8 says, "to keep me from being ineffective or unfruitful
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:50.800]   in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.800]   Persistent faith.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:57.680]   You know, being in China, you're tempted to always cut corners.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.080]   Yeah, it's hard.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:07.980]   One of the hardest things about being a Christian and working in a company is just ethics.
[00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:08.980]   Everyone else does it.
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:09.980]   How come we can't do it?
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:14.580]   If we don't do it that way, then our business will sink.
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:24.840]   There was one time I exchanged some money and I got back Rem and B and just one of them,
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.840]   one of the bills was fake.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:31.180]   It was funny because I didn't know it was a fake so I gave it to a taxi driver and he
[00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:35.580]   looked at me and he started feeling it and he's like, "No, give me a different one."
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:39.900]   He saw I had another $100, 100 kuai, so I, you know, I, okay, busted.
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:40.900]   All right, here you go.
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:41.900]   Here's the other 100 kuai.
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:47.140]   So I take the fake bill with me and you know, I'm not, it's not to make it all dramatic,
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:52.620]   but yeah, the temptation to do something with that bill was great.
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:59.620]   Find another taxi driver, find another storekeeper, pass off that bill.
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:04.700]   Keep that corrupted cycle of counterfeit going.
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:08.580]   You know, I was asking around to my friends, Christian friends, "Hey, what do I do with
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:09.580]   this?
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.380]   Do I take it to the bank?"
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:14.140]   And I say, "You take it to the bank.
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:15.140]   They'll just take it away from you."
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:18.140]   I'm like, "They're not going to give me back the 100 kuai?"
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:19.140]   He's like, "Nope."
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:20.140]   "What?
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:24.180]   Man, I know 100 kuai is not that much.
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:29.820]   It's like $20 in the US, but man, 100 kuai could go a long way in China."
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.980]   And then one other guy suggested, "Why don't you just go to an ATM?
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.300]   Just put the fake bill in.
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.780]   If they process it, then fine.
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:37.940]   Take out a real one."
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:43.540]   And I'm just sitting there and I'm like, "Is that right?
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:45.860]   Are those really my only options?"
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:52.320]   Of course, the other option is just to throw it away.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.660]   And so I was in this room talking to my coworkers and they're all Christian.
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:58.260]   You know, they're all Christian.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.980]   And they're all looking at me like, "What are you going to do?"
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:05.100]   I'm like, "Oh."
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:11.100]   In the end, one of the coworkers was the financial person, the finance office.
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.100]   And I said, "Here."
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:13.100]   I gave it to her.
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.780]   This is what they do in America, okay?
[00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:15.780]   This is what I told her.
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:21.620]   I said, "They put the fake bills on the wall and they put fake on it."
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:24.300]   And it just became a way to westernize the office.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.140]   Just put it on there.
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:34.020]   And I just remember, she came up to me and she was like, "Wow, I can't believe you just
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:35.020]   did that."
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.020]   I'm like, "Why?"
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.420]   She said, "Most people I know would just try to get rid of that bill and try to get some
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:41.900]   sort of value from it."
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:45.940]   And for me, at that moment, it just kind of hit me.
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.740]   Yeah, living that holy life.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:52.020]   Yeah, it was just a hundred Rem and Be.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:58.620]   And still though, to persist, to make those decisions to live a holy life matters in the
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.900]   witness of the gospel.
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:09.460]   And so this Syrophoenician woman, Jesus was able to draw out from her that important commodity
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.300]   of faith.
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.940]   Right?
[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:16.980]   Now, I'm going to...
[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:19.380]   I know I'm probably going to end really early.
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:27.580]   But I just want to share with you guys that it's been a tremendous joy so far to serve
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:28.580]   overseas.
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:33.580]   Yeah, I know you see our blog posts and you might see our Facebook and like, "Oh man,
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:34.580]   airpocalypse.
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.980]   Oh man, it's over 500."
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.220]   And all this other stuff.
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:47.420]   But to be honest with you, and if you talk to me privately, I'll say the same exact thing.
[00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:53.940]   There's so much joy in serving the Lord overseas.
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.660]   To see lives transformed.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:37:02.020]   I mean, I wasn't able to talk about it this morning, but other people that we sovereignly
[00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:06.260]   brought into our lives and the changes that have taken place.
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.540]   There's just so much joy.
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:11.820]   I'm glad that I'm in China.
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:18.020]   And though there are going to be potential obstacles coming along the way, right?
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.500]   We know the housing market is going up.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.620]   We know the education costs will come.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:25.300]   A lot of it financially based.
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:30.580]   But I don't know if I would trade anything.
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.980]   Use those as reasons to come back.
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:40.860]   There's just a lot of joy in being able to be a participant in His work overseas.
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:48.740]   And I think the greatest reason why there's so much joy, and I'm excited to go back, February
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:49.740]   10th.
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:50.740]   That's when we're going back.
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:54.380]   It's a little bittersweet, but more sweet than bitter.
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:38:00.860]   Because we get to go back and be able to participate in His work.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:07.820]   Second Corinthians 5.14, it says, "For the love of Christ controls us."
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:13.300]   That's not the full sentence there, but that's the part I want us to focus on as we slowly
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.740]   come to a conclusion here.
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:22.020]   For the love of Christ controls us.
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.940]   I'm not going overseas because of some desire to be Chinese.
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.820]   Like, I'm Korean.
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:31.500]   Like, I'm Asian enough, okay?
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.500]   You know?
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:36.540]   I'm not going over to China just to raise my family, to have them have different cultures
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:37.540]   in their lives.
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.820]   That's going to be one.
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:43.140]   He's going to have an identity crisis when he's a teenager.
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.140]   Am I Korean?
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.140]   Am I Japanese?
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:46.140]   Am I American?
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.140]   I'm living in China.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:48.140]   What's going on here?
[00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.140]   You know?
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:58.420]   Just for the record, he said he's Korean, but I'm trying to correct him on that, okay?
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:01.860]   Second Corinthians 5.14 is the reason.
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:10.100]   This love that Christ has shown me, has shown to our family, is what is compelling us to
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.680]   keep running the race, right?
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:18.980]   To keep sharing the gospel, to keep discipling others, you know, to continue to share the
[00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:27.020]   good news of Jesus Christ, believer or non-believer, because it's worth it, right?
[00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:35.020]   To understand this love, the quality of that love that Jesus has for his people is tremendous.
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:40.400]   It is a great motivation and it's a great reminder of the joy that we have in knowing
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.100]   that we are his.
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.620]   And there will be nothing that will tear us away from that.
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:55.140]   And so there's a lot of joy going back, and going back to restart the work that we started.
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:40:00.220]   And as we kind of conclude, there's just one question that I want to leave us with.
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:05.940]   Because I know some of you guys in this room, yeah, missions, yeah, going overseas, it's
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:07.540]   a thought.
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:11.380]   Some of you guys maybe have wrestled with it longer than others.
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:17.340]   Maybe some of you guys came to a quick conclusion that, "That's just not for me."
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:20.420]   I used to be like that too, you know, when I thought about overseas work.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.940]   It's just not for me.
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:29.300]   And then I just remember this one question unraveled all of those barriers, completely
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:30.300]   unraveled it.
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.140]   And this is what my friend told me.
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:34.140]   He said, "Why not?"
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.140]   I'm like, "What?
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:36.140]   What did you say?"
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.140]   He's like, "Why not?
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.140]   Why not go?
[00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.140]   Why not participate?"
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:51.820]   I was like, I was deeply challenged by that question.
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:55.140]   And that's the same question that I want to leave with you guys too.
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:41:01.060]   When it comes to going overseas, why not?
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:07.740]   I'm not saying you have to go like what our family did, you know, but I'm saying, why
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:10.740]   not?
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:13.880]   If you want to be a goer, then go.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:17.700]   If you want to be a sender, then send.
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:23.700]   But find a way to participate in the work overseas.
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:28.580]   Everything I've shared so far this morning, I think everything that I have yet to share,
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:34.500]   if you guys want to come up and talk, all of it really is an answered prayer to everything.
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.780]   I know you guys prayed for us, and I'm so grateful.
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:42.060]   And I want to use this morning to be able to edify you guys and say, these are answered
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:44.340]   prayers.
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:46.140]   So let's keep praying.
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:50.100]   Let's have people in this room start thinking about why not.
[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:57.260]   And let's see where God will take us so that the gospel can continue forward to the nations.
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:42:07.260]   And so with that, we'll pray and we'll close.
[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:17.180]   Heavenly Father, we thank you again for this morning and as we just looked at those observations
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:27.420]   from the text and as we understand, Lord God, the priority of faith, the importance of persistent
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:40.940]   faith, help us, Lord God, for all of us here in this room, to really seek to apply, to
[00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:41.940]   seek you out.
[00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:47.500]   I know, Lord God, that there's a lot of distractions, a lot of priorities that are constantly fighting
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:55.460]   for our attention, seeking to displace you as our top priority.
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:43:00.660]   So God, would today be a day in which we are reminded how important it is to place our
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:07.580]   faith in you and not ourselves, to place our faith in our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:14.100]   and not in any other blessings or gifts that you have blessed us with, but to pursue you,
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:17.100]   Lord God, with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.100]   And so God, we thank you.
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:19.100]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:19.620]   Amen.
