[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   If you guys have your Bibles, I encourage you to turn them to Philippians chapter 4.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.640]   We're going to be… and keep them open to Philippians 4.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.520]   We're going to be looking at that passage intensely today.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.040]   So turn in your Bibles to Philippians chapter 4.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.200]   And I think it's up behind…
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.360]   Yeah, there we go.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.800]   But I encourage you actually to follow along in your personal Bibles if you can.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.120]   Rejoice in the Lord always.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.100]   Again, I will say rejoice.
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.140]   Let your gentle spirit be known to all men.
[00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.700]   The Lord is near.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.000]   Be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.640]   Let your requests be made known to God.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.760]   And the peace of God which surpasses all comprehension will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.760]   Jesus.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.440]   Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.400]   is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence in
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.600]   anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.520]   The things you've learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.400]   and the God of peace will be with you.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.040]   Let's pray together.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.480]   Heavenly Father, we ask that you would feed your sheep today, that we being fed will live
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.040]   lives that reflect your kindness and your goodness.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.840]   And Father, that the world will know that you indeed are a good and faithful God.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.360]   And we pray that our lives will be characterized by what we learn.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.340]   And we thank you, Father, for just your kindness that calls us here and I pray for just us
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:51.400]   all to leave here having understood what you desire for our… just our lives and our worship.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.760]   Thank you and in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.120]   This is a passage that many of you guys, especially if you've grown up in church, you're familiar
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.120]   with.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.640]   A bunch of these verses are hanging on people's walls.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.400]   And as a kid, you know, you end up memorizing some of these passages.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.440]   And rightfully so, these verses are powerful and uplifting.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.240]   But just a background to the letter to Philippi and to the church there.
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.140]   The Philippian… the letter to the Philippian church is one of Paul's prison epistles, one
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.640]   of the letters written toward the end of his life.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.440]   The chief purpose of this letter is to encourage the people in that church.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.120]   And so Paul wants to encourage the Philippian church to be steadfast and joy-filled, to
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.320]   serve God, to serve others.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.040]   He desires that they conduct themselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, which
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.440]   is our theme for this year at Berean, and to live in a manner befitting of the gospel
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.720]   message that they have received.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.480]   They are to follow Christ's humble example and to live in proper response to the gospel
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.040]   that has been proclaimed in their midst.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.760]   So I'm going to just kind of go through these passages… through these verses and just
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.880]   to show you what Paul is pushing us toward.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.840]   So the first verse, verse 4, "Rejoice in the Lord always."
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.360]   Again I will say, "Rejoice."
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.160]   The Philippians and all who are to read this letter are commanded to live joyfully as kingdom
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.160]   citizens.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.080]   And in this book, you will see the word "joy" repeated again and again all throughout the
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.560]   just chapters 1 through 4.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.760]   And in chapter 4, Paul gives some exhortation on how to do that.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.480]   So in verse 4 it reads, "Rejoice in the Lord always."
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.360]   Again I will say, "Rejoice."
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.660]   And this is the only place in the book of Philippians where Paul repeats himself.
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.960]   And actually this is the third time he said this.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:00.360]   Okay, so in chapter 3, verse 1, Paul has said, "Rejoice, finally, my brethren, rejoice in
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.720]   the Lord."
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.880]   When we repeat ourselves, it is usually to emphasize something we believe to be very
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.640]   important.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.040]   We do not repeat something that is of insignificance.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.560]   So if I said, "Good morning, everybody," I will say it again.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.560]   "Good morning."
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.380]   It's just awkward, right?
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.800]   But if I say, "Hey, our SEEDS meeting is at 1.30 p.m."
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.800]   Let me repeat.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.840]   "Our SEEDS meeting starts at 1.30 p.m."
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.560]   There is an expectation that I'm communicating to you that you guys come on time.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:41.520]   So when Paul is saying, "Rejoice in the Lord always," let me repeat this, "Rejoice," he
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.440]   means it.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.000]   So this is not an uncommon theme.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.760]   Joy is not an uncommon theme in Paul's writing.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.660]   And I do want to pause and have us reflect on this.
[00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.720]   How do we just apply chapter 4, verse 4 in our lives?
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.360]   Is this possible to rejoice always?
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.320]   Think about it.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.380]   Because when a command of Scripture, when we read it, it looks impossible or impractical,
[00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:15.920]   what we usually end up doing is we just gloss over it, don't think to apply it, and we move
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.920]   on.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.920]   Right?
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.120]   How many of you guys don't...
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.620]   You don't need to raise your hand...
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.240]   Are guilty of reading this passage and not thinking about it?
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.640]   Okay, "Rejoice in the Lord always," I'll say it again, "Rejoice."
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.840]   Okay, give me something more meaty, something more applicable.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.760]   We move on like that.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:40.080]   Is it possible for you and me to be joyful always?
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:46.080]   And one of the greatest consequences of the fall is that you and I have a hard time enjoying
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.160]   something at all times.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.640]   We get tired of things.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:57.960]   You and I have emotional and spiritual ADD, and we're unable to enjoy something for an
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.320]   extended period of time.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.880]   Just let me illustrate.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.240]   The first time I ever heard about Poke Bowl was June 2017.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.960]   I was late to the game because I haven't been in the country for nine years.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.120]   So that was the best thing I've ever eaten at that moment.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.000]   I was like, "Whoa, this yellowtail and the salmon with the sriracha with this crab and
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.640]   the avocado and the seaweed with the sesame seeds and the oil."
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.240]   I thought it was like food from heaven.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.480]   And then I ate it again like a couple days later, and then I flew to Korea.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.120]   And from June to March, I was preaching how good Poke Bowl was to all of my friends who
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.760]   are living abroad, who are going to visit the States.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.440]   And I was like fantasizing about it.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.840]   And I was like just excited to eat Poke Bowl when I got back here in March.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.480]   And I had it three times that first week.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.560]   And I started getting sick of it really quick.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.800]   Because even if something is very good, you get tired of it.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.980]   Things.
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:07.280]   My first Apple product was a graduation gift given to me in 2009.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.280]   I had an iPod Touch, and I thought this was the coolest thing ever.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.680]   I carried it around everywhere.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.720]   I even downloaded like a lemonade game on it.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.120]   And I was like, "Yes, there's a calculator and everything in one."
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.440]   And then I went to China, and one of the brothers that were there had an iPhone 3.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:28.240]   I was like, "Ooh, there's a calculator and a game player and a music thing and a phone."
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.240]   So then there's a desire in me to have one of those.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.000]   And you guys know where this is going.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.360]   Then came the 4 and the 5 and the 6 and the 6+, 7, 7+, 8, 8.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.440]   So I have an 8+.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:45.240]   And when something new comes out, the thing that we enjoyed, it loses its luster.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.920]   Same goes with clothes, shoes, cars, homes.
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:56.080]   You start seeing the blemishes in the home that you craved to have.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.240]   Experiences.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.200]   The first time I went on business class on a plane, I did what my wife did the first
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.360]   time she went on business class.
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.800]   I saw her just do this.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.040]   And then she was taking pictures of all the food that came out, even the silverware.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.000]   I was like, "Dude, what are you doing?"
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.100]   I did the same thing.
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.120]   And now I go on business...
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.400]   I've gone enough where now I'm on business class, I don't think about all the amenities
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.400]   that I could enjoy.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.440]   But occasionally I think of, "What would it be like to be on first class?"
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.240]   That's just the human heart.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.160]   Do you remember your first time at Berean?
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.360]   Do you still feel this way?
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.080]   Do you still feel that pull, that excitement to come worship?
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.080]   People too, right?
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.380]   I've been married 11 and a half years.
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:47.840]   Do you guys remember the first time that girl you liked or the guy you liked, they called
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:56.120]   you on your phone, it rang, and it read their name, and you're like, "Hello?"
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.840]   Eleven and a half years later, I do love my wife a lot more than I did then.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.080]   But sometimes when she calls, I don't have that same...
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.080]   Okay, I'm going to just stop there.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.080]   I might get in trouble.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.080]   She's right there.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.760]   But you guys get my point.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.260]   One of the tragedies of the fall is that our enjoyment of things is tainted, it's broken.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.620]   We get tired of things.
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.620]   We get tired of our relationship, even with God.
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.980]   When someone asks you, "How are you doing spiritually?"
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:30.140]   You usually will answer depending on how you feel, whether you feel close to the Lord,
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.480]   whether you feel distant from the Lord, whether you feel guilty before the Lord because you
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.800]   haven't done your quiet time, whether you've prayed enough or a little.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.920]   You will answer with how you feel.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.720]   And after you've been a Christian for a while, there are seasons where prayer is hard, worship
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.900]   is routine, serving the church is a struggle.
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:58.180]   And even though we love God more deeply than we did before, we can't help but feel a distance,
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.500]   sometimes a vast chasm between me and God.
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:08.080]   So when we read a passage like, "Rejoice always," Thessalonians 5:16, and we find out that that's
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:14.000]   God's will for our lives, we actually just kind of tend to gloss over it, don't think
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.240]   much of it because it seems too ideal, too impractical, impossible to follow.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:27.240]   Because in our brokenness, in our broken ability to enjoy things fully, being joyful always
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:35.620]   seems too ridiculous of a command, so we actually don't think about it.
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:42.560]   Even if it was just spiritual ADD that we struggle with, it'd be hard to enjoy.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:48.440]   But add in sickness, tragedy, persecution, and death, we look at commands like, "Be joyful
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.800]   always," and we basically ignore them.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.920]   Why?
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.540]   Because in a broken and fallen world full of vanity, pain, sorrow, and strife, this does
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.920]   not seem realistic.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.040]   But this is a command.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:10.120]   This is God's will that you and I be unceasingly joyful, and it's all over Scripture.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.340]   But is this possible?
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.160]   And I emphasize this because this is a super important question.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.500]   Is this possible?
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:26.820]   Can you and I in our spiritual ADD with all of our tainted emotions obey this command?
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.340]   And I'll say yes.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.640]   And I'm going to show you why in verse 5.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.620]   Let's look at verse 5.
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:40.200]   It reads, "Let your gentleness be known to all men.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.460]   The Lord is near."
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:48.780]   If you read through Philippians 4, 4 through 9, that verse seems and feels so awkward and
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.100]   out of place.
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:55.080]   I've seen verse 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 on a frame or shared on a Facebook.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.140]   I've seen all of those.
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.380]   I've never seen 5.
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:06.120]   But verse 5 is the most important verse in this whole section.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.700]   And so we're going to spend a little bit of time looking over this.
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.700]   Be joyful always.
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.800]   Again I will say rejoice.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.840]   Let your gentle spirit be known to all men.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.840]   The Lord is near.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.280]   What does that mean?
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.220]   So yeah, you could flip it.
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:27.480]   In the Greek, the word is, well, if you look up there, I put the word gentle spirit in
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.040]   bolded and yellow font.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.880]   Depending on the translation you use, you will get a slightly different take on this
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:34.880]   word.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.600]   The Greek root word is epiakia.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.600]   Can you repeat after me?
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.600]   Epiakia.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:48.240]   E. B. A. K. A. Epiakia.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.240]   Epiakia.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:54.320]   This is an important word and we're going to come back to this multiple times.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:13:00.120]   In this form, it's here in the nominative, neuter, singular, adjectival form of epiakis
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.680]   for you nerds out there.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:08.240]   But this is a very difficult word from the Greek to translate into English.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:15.040]   So in every single one of your Bibles, there is an interpretation included in this translation.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.000]   So if you look at this, in the King James Version, it says, "Let your moderation be
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   known."
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.840]   ESV, "Let your reasonableness be known."
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.500]   NIV, "Let your gentleness be known.
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.120]   Let your graciousness be known."
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:33.540]   And the Living Bible says, "Let your unselfish and considerate spirit be evident to all."
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:39.340]   So every, if you try to apply this, depending on what version you use, you will get a slightly
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.800]   different picture.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.680]   This is what the word epiakia means.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:51.600]   Can you flip to the next part?
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.360]   Can you click on it?
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:14:00.800]   "Steadfastness, grace, and calmness that comes with experience, involvement, and age."
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:06.600]   "Steadfastness, grace, and calmness that comes with experience, involvement, and age."
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.600]   That's a mouthful.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.000]   Now, what does that look like?
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.120]   In any sport, let's say the finals or a championship game in the playoffs, there's a lot of pressure.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.240]   So if you have a team full of rookies, if you have a team full of young people, a lot
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.640]   of times they cave under the pressure.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:29.760]   But if you have someone who's an experienced veteran, usually they stay calm and poised
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:34.640]   no matter how behind they are in the game.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.360]   Players can easily get caught up in the moment.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.800]   That's why highly competitive teams fill their rosters with veteran players, people who've
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:46.920]   been there, who can remain calm in crunch time.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.920]   Experience doesn't lie.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.000]   The experience to people, they don't get rattled.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.280]   In fact, there's a steadiness, composure, and grace about them.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:02.320]   So if you're a rookie, you want to be like that championship-tested player.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.840]   I also think about the elderly.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:10.320]   The elderly handle disease and death with much more dignity, poise, and grace than a
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.120]   young person does.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.240]   Right?
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.800]   Why is that?
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.640]   Because they've been around it more.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.100]   They've embraced it as a natural part of life.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:28.940]   So they're not rattled when friends pass away, when someone gets sick.
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:34.720]   They take it with a graciousness and a calm.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.020]   That's this word, apakea.
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:46.040]   I like to call it battle-tested Christian common sense, Christian wisdom.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.360]   So rejoice in the Lord always.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.920]   I will say it again, rejoice.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:58.600]   Let your battle-tested Christian common sense be made clear to everybody around you.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.780]   That's the reason for your joy.
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:02.780]   The Lord is near.
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:06.080]   Can we go to the next slide?
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:12.760]   There's two Greek words here, kyrios, which means Lord, and engos, which is near.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:18.240]   And this near is not the near as in physical closeness.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:23.080]   This near is in reference to it's coming soon.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.760]   So it's actually should be translated, the Lord is soon.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.040]   But that's kind of awkward English, so you won't see that in your translations.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.840]   Why do we rejoice?
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:38.480]   Because we've been battle-tested, we know and we have a grace and a calmness that God
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:47.240]   is good and He is sovereign and that He is coming soon.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.960]   So why is this so central to the passage?
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:52.960]   Rejoice in the Lord always.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.000]   Again, I'll say rejoice.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.880]   Let your battle-tested Christian wisdom be known to all men.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:02.960]   The Lord is soon and all the tainted, ugly, corrupted things are going to quickly pass.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.160]   So be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.720]   make your requests known to God.
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.480]   There's a flow here.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:17.400]   Do you guys see why verse five is so central to this whole section?
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:25.560]   In short, verse five is suggesting to us that believable joy, more than an emotion, it's
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.000]   an attitude of the heart.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.880]   So I'm going to show you some other passages so you're not – I'm not like talking
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.520]   out my armpit, okay?
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.920]   So let's look at some of another passages.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:43.460]   James chapter one verse two says, "Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.840]   various trials."
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.800]   Only a crazy person would react like this.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.000]   "I just lost my job.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.160]   I can't pay my bills.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.720]   I'm so happy."
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.240]   If someone did that, I would slap them in the head.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.360]   "What's wrong with you?"
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:10.040]   Or I would assume they're being super sarcastic because that's not an appropriate response.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:17.080]   First Peter one, three to six, or and six, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:22.600]   Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.360]   hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.680]   And in this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.080]   have been distressed by various trials."
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:40.720]   First Peter is wrought with cases of abuse, oppression, suffering, persecution.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.220]   People are being beheaded.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.080]   People are being tortured because of their faith.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:51.640]   And he is saying, "Rejoice.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:57.400]   For it has been granted to you," earlier it says in Philippians, "for Christ's sake, not
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.200]   only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake."
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.200]   So Paul is saying, "You are going to suffer.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.280]   Be joyful."
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.280]   Is he a sick man?
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.640]   So what does joy look like?
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:21.200]   So biblical joy is more of an attitude of the heart than an emotional response.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:26.840]   So sometimes in joy, I will have a delighted, happy emotion.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.280]   Sometimes in my joy, I will grieve.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.940]   Biblical joy is more an attitude of the heart than an emotion.
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:34.940]   So what does it look like?
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.260]   "Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:43.320]   before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.160]   of the throne of God."
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.800]   And the word joy is not explicitly written in Job chapter 1, but there is joy there.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:55.940]   And Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head, fell to the ground, and worshipped and
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.440]   demonstrated his joy before his almighty creator.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.280]   Matthew 13, 44, "The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.560]   a man found and hid again.
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:11.120]   And from joy over it, he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field."
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:16.040]   So what is joy?
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:24.420]   It's an attitude of the heart found only in kingdom citizens that delights in and willingly
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:31.480]   submits to the goodness and the sovereignty of God.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:39.440]   The attitude of the heart found only in kingdom citizens that delights in and willingly submits
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:44.400]   to the goodness and the sovereignty of God.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.560]   So you can be joyful while you weep.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.900]   You can be joyful while you mourn.
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:57.020]   You can be joyful when you're under heavy stress or persecution.
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:04.860]   You can be joyful in the face of tragedy while living in a very fallen world.
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:11.540]   You can be joyful when someone you love goes through tragedy.
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:16.460]   You can be joy-filled in any and every circumstance.
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.080]   So joy is characteristic of the children of God.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.940]   It is actual proof of your kingdom citizenship.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.500]   It's evidence.
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.420]   If you look at Galatians 5, you guys know the fruit of the Spirit?
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:32.940]   The fruit of the Spirit is love, and then what?
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.040]   Joy.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.900]   That is evidence of the Holy Spirit living in you.
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.900]   And joy again and again in Scripture, it's commanded.
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:48.620]   So if you are a Christian and you don't have joy in your life, this is disobedience.
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:54.540]   You are in sin if your life is not characterized by joy.
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:59.580]   Do you see why you can't just gloss over rejoicing the Lord always, I'll say it again, rejoice,
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:04.220]   and not think about it, not think to apply it?
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:07.900]   You can't just treat it like an impossibility, an impracticality, something just left in
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.740]   theory.
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:15.540]   Joylessness is disobedience.
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.540]   A joyless Christian is an oxymoron.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.980]   The terms are mutually exclusive.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:27.860]   Joyless and Christian should never be used together except in a sermon.
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:34.660]   But you know, so many church people are mired in joyless routine.
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:38.260]   Serving Christ, it feels like a duty.
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.820]   It's a responsibility.
[00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.500]   It's a burden.
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:46.820]   Yes, Jesus died for my sins, so I have to serve Him and obey Him.
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:53.660]   I have to go abroad and share the gospel because He died for my sins.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.220]   Why?
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.340]   Because if I don't, He's going to throw me in hell.
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:02.060]   We won't ever verbalize that.
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:07.700]   A lot of times, joylessness in your life and mine looks like that, religious routine.
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.620]   I have to do my quiet time.
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:16.340]   Otherwise, my accountability partners are going to, like, discipline me or rebuke me.
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.420]   The world is confused.
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.460]   This world is decaying.
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.980]   It's supposed to be in worship and in awe of God.
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:28.900]   It's what we were created to give glory to God.
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.780]   But a lot of times, our evangelistic messages start with, "When you die, are you going to
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:37.540]   heaven or hell?"
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.660]   Evangelistic messages need to start with, "You were created for a relationship with
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:45.620]   God, to know God and to enjoy God forever."
[00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.180]   That's how the gospel really should start.
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:52.220]   This is battle-tested wisdom.
[00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:56.640]   This apakea, you and I need to make known to all men.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.800]   So verse 5 is not out of place here.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.660]   Verse 5 is central.
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.940]   Why rejoice?
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:08.460]   Our joy points to God's redemptive work.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:12.560]   So Christians are going to, non-Christians are going to be looking at your life, if you
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:19.980]   have no joy, if you have no zeal, they don't see any desire to know this God that you profess
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.480]   to believe.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.480]   So please remember this.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.940]   Can you click on this?
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.620]   A joyless church will do a horrible job at being salt and light to a decaying and darkened
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:33.180]   world.
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:39.700]   Churchianity breeds joyless Christianity.
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:44.420]   Churchianity breeds joyless Christianity.
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:48.100]   A joyless church will do a horrible job at being salt and light to a decaying and darkened
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.060]   world.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.820]   So what – how do we maintain our joy?
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:57.420]   Let's look at verse 6 and 7.
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.980]   Be anxious for nothing, but in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving,
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:05.460]   let your requests be made known to God.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.260]   And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.220]   your minds in Christ Jesus.
[00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.460]   There's a logical flow to this passage.
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.780]   There is, be joyful always, I will say it again, rejoice.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.180]   Let your apakea be known to all men.
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.700]   The Lord is soon near.
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.500]   So here, this is how you maintain your joy, pray.
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.300]   That's the first application.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:34.460]   And verse 6 is an often memorized, frequently quoted verse of the Bible, but this is coming
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.060]   in context of letting our apakea be known.
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:42.820]   So we are exhorted to pray, to lift up everything with gratitude to the Lord.
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:47.340]   All of our burdens, all of our anxieties, all of the prayer requests that we have, to
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.820]   lift them up.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.660]   And we're going to go into this more on Friday night when we have our All Church Praise and
[00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.660]   Prayer.
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.140]   Okay, so that's a plug.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.460]   So come.
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.700]   We are exhorted to pray.
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.780]   And then what happens?
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:09.920]   The peace of God, which is a mystery beyond all human understanding, will come and guard
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:14.140]   our hearts and our minds in Christ Jesus.
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:19.220]   The Greek word here is a word, phruresai.
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.860]   It's a military word.
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:28.420]   It means the military guard, the sentry, will come and protect like they come and protect
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.420]   the king.
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:32.980]   So it's like the secret service of God.
[00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:37.340]   So if a king is standing there, his soldiers will surround him.
[00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:43.940]   If he's in danger, they will surround him with their shields, with their spears, and
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:48.620]   they will make an impenetrable wall of defense around the king.
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:56.780]   That's what the peace of God will do as we lift up our prayers to him.
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.520]   And those who have walked with the Lord, they can have their hearts filled with peace no
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.840]   matter what the circumstance.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.980]   The first application that we read is to pray.
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:14.100]   The second one, verse 8, "Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:19.340]   is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is good repute, if there is any excellence
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:22.260]   in anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things."
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:27.660]   You know, whenever – early on when I first studied this passage many years ago, I always
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.340]   thought of like raindrops and roses and whiskers on kids.
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:36.540]   You guys – when the dog bites, when the bee stings, when I'm feeling sad, I simply
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.420]   remember my favorite things and then I don't feel so bad.
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.980]   Is that what it's talking about?
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.500]   No.
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:49.940]   It's talking about make an obsession of something.
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:28:00.820]   What are the things that we are called to dwell and obsess over?
[00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:04.140]   Over the Word of God.
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.620]   The first application really that we see here is to pray.
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:10.580]   The second one is to obsess over His Word.
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.140]   Now some of you guys, if you're like me, you're tripping over this Word finally.
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.580]   Like, "Wait a minute.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.540]   Hey, you're milking it here."
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.100]   Be joyful always, that's the what.
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.780]   Let your epiakia be known to all men, that's the why.
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:27.100]   And then you're coming up with three howls, but there's a finally in the middle of this.
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.500]   As I was – whenever I do sermon prep, I actually memorize the passage I'm going to
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.660]   preach on and I go over it again and again and again.
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:37.160]   But this section I started maybe three months ago, two, three months ago, just memorizing
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.140]   every day about two, three times, just going over this.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:45.820]   And every time I go over this, there is this logical flow, but then I get to this finally
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.700]   and it annoyed me.
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:55.580]   So I looked at the Word, it was loipan, which is actually better translated, "Furthermore,
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.100]   moreover, in addition to."
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.860]   And you see that actually in chapter three, verse one.
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.580]   And then he goes on to – finally – and then he goes on to write another half of the
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.900]   book.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:11.500]   This is a second application to dwell over and obsess with the Word of God.
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:15.180]   So verse eight is pointing us to eating the Word.
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.180]   And here's what I mean by eating the Word.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:23.860]   Reflecting on the centrality of Christ through the intake of the Word of God.
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.060]   Is God's Word important?
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.860]   You guys will all probably nod yes.
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.660]   How important is the Word of God?
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:35.140]   And you guys will all probably give me textbook answers from your head.
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:39.500]   After all, our church's second vision is equipping every saint with God's inerrant
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.540]   Word.
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:44.780]   But here's how you can really answer the question, how important is it the Word of
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:47.580]   God?
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:51.900]   How desperate are you each and every day to feed off His Word?
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:58.500]   How much or how little time do you invest to the study of His Word each day?
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:03.100]   How much or how little of His Word did you eat this week?
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:08.180]   There's your answer.
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:15.780]   And there is a correlation between our intake of God's Word and our joy.
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.860]   And allow me to illustrate with this story.
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.900]   There should be a picture that comes up.
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:20.900]   Clearly.
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:27.200]   I took this picture December 3rd, 2016.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:33.760]   This is a village sitting on a stone quarry just outside of Kampala, Uganda.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.840]   Next picture.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:43.420]   Children as far as little as four years old, they break rocks all day.
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:48.580]   And when these little children break enough rocks into little smithereens and they collect
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:53.560]   a two-gallon bucket of these rocks, they'll get 90 cents.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.880]   And they get injured in the process.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.080]   Next picture.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.320]   And one of those little girls that we met was a little girl in green shorts.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.880]   Her name is Angela.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:09.760]   And she's one of the kids who breaks these rocks all day.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:15.240]   Two weeks prior to our visit, her father was beaten to death.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.280]   They went to the police.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.000]   They did nothing.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.260]   Because there's nothing in it for the police to help a little child living in these quarters.
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:30.540]   So we felt so bad that we went to pray for her and her family.
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:33.640]   And we met her mom.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.200]   Angela's mother was suffering from AIDS.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:41.740]   And when we met her, she was listless, ill.
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:46.460]   She was bone thin and weighed about 80 pounds.
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:51.480]   In Uganda, there are many people who are suffering from AIDS.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:57.820]   And the government of Uganda actually supplies AIDS patients with free AIDS medicine, which
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.520]   is an amazing thing in and of itself.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:08.040]   So Angela's mom took the AIDS medicine regularly every day.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:15.340]   But the problem was that she was eating one small meal every two to three days.
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:16.380]   So we prayed for Angela.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:17.380]   We prayed for her mom.
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:19.560]   We enrolled her into the Compassion Program.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:25.940]   And we sent $200 of groceries to be sent to her family.
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:30.140]   And I took this picture December 3, 2016.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:36.140]   Seventeen days later, I got an email informing me that Angela's mother had passed away.
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:40.600]   Within a month, Angela lost mom and dad.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.180]   The cause of death was not AIDS.
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:46.620]   The cause of death was malnourishment.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.820]   Within AIDS medicine, Angela's mom had needed food.
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:57.780]   So for AIDS patients, medical treatment is absolutely essential for those who are sick.
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:02.780]   But of greater importance for these patients is a regular intake of food.
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:07.460]   So when a person is actually fed and healthy, you know your bodies are attacked by viruses
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.220]   and germs all the time?
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.340]   Nod your heads if you already knew this.
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:16.580]   But most of the time, we don't -- it doesn't feel like anything because it just passes
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:20.820]   away because our bodies just defend.
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:26.060]   But if our immune systems are down and our bodies are weak, the tiniest germ can have
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:30.660]   devastating effects.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.180]   Medicine is good.
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:36.540]   But without food, even good medicine -- actually, what happens?
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:37.540]   It has side effects.
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.540]   You're not supposed to eat medicine without food.
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:43.380]   And why do I share this?
[00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:49.780]   Everything that is good that comes with church life -- participation in small groups, meeting
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:55.020]   up with brothers and sisters in Christ, serving the church, preparing the snacks, reading
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:34:02.780]   theology books, coming to praise nights, giving to missions, going on a short-term trip -- these
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.940]   are all good things, but they are supplemental.
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.140]   They are medicinal.
[00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:13.100]   They are good things, but none of these things can take the place of a steady diet of the
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.340]   Word of God.
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:23.540]   Joylessness and spiritual malnourishment go hand in hand.
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.660]   You know what causes burnout in people?
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:31.100]   They're serving the church with a passion, but the Word of God is not their fuel.
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.580]   Maybe their guilt, their obligation, their desire to get recognized -- that's the fuel.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.180]   And what happens?
[00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:39.340]   They burn out.
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:46.420]   But worse than that, they explode like poison, and then they leave the church.
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:50.380]   Malnourishment is a dangerous, dangerous thing.
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.380]   I've been a pastor for 18 years.
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:55.460]   This is my 18th year.
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:35:01.040]   And I think just a little more than half of it I've done ministry out of the U.S.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:08.300]   So most of my ministry -- more than half of my ministry has been away from Orange County.
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.860]   And I'm not exaggerating when I say this.
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:18.820]   I feel a greater spiritual warfare here in Orange County than anywhere else I've visited.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:25.200]   There are more spiritual landmines, more spiritual booby traps, and spiritual explosives here
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:32.300]   that are out to maim you than in most parts of the world.
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:37.340]   The enemy is actively, hungrily prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for souls to
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:41.180]   devour as is the first Peter.
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:46.180]   But here, he is wearing Orange County upper-middle-class material and comfort-based happy clothes.
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:51.840]   So you just don't know he's there.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:56.260]   You know, there was a survey taken in 1988 on Navy SEALs.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:00.340]   And this is 30 years out of date, but I felt like, well, this is the only thing I could
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:01.340]   find.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:09.800]   But 1988 survey taken of 267 Navy SEALs, the average Navy SEAL consumed 3,887 calories
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.860]   a day.
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:19.620]   An average male who is 6 feet 185 pounds needs 1,728 calories a day.
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:26.140]   So an average Navy SEAL consumes more than double that of a 6 foot 185 pound man's necessary
[00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.860]   requirements.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:34.160]   And during hell week training, these Navy SEALs consume 7,000 calories a day.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.020]   And they all lose weight.
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:38.900]   Why do they train so rigorously?
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.240]   Why do they eat so much?
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.220]   Because they're in the first in combat.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:48.060]   They go to where the fighting is heavy, so they need to eat.
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:56.820]   So common sense will tell you that they need to eat a lot because they're going to go fight.
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.980]   The closer you are to war, the more you need to eat.
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:05.560]   First Peter 211 reads, "Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers in the world to abstain
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:10.220]   from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul."
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:16.020]   I found that in Orange County, there are more things that are waging war against the soul
[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:21.060]   than in any part of the rest of the world.
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:26.860]   So you tell me how much Bible intake is enough each day.
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:36.260]   I'll tell you this, you cannot spiritually survive with one sermon a week.
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:42.860]   You cannot survive on doing two or three cute little quiet times over the course of the
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:46.340]   week.
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:54.580]   You can take in all the spiritual medicine that you want, but if you don't take a steady
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:38:08.940]   diet of God's Word, you're going to have a hard time fighting.
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:17.300]   You cannot survive without the Word of God.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.020]   So how do we take in God's Word?
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:23.580]   In short, and you've heard this before, preach the gospel to yourself every day.
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.020]   And I agree with that 100%.
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:29.020]   I just don't like how it's become trendy and how that gospel starts with, "Jesus died for
[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:30.020]   your sins."
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:33.460]   That's not the best place to start the gospel message.
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:37.140]   The gospel message does not start with, "Jesus died for your sins."
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:44.980]   Yes, preach the gospel to yourself daily, but the gospel starts with, "In the beginning,
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.560]   God created the heavens and the earth.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.660]   He created it good.
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.340]   He created it to be enjoyed.
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:52.120]   He created man.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:57.260]   Man was created in the image of the triune God and was also therefore good.
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:04.380]   God and man had a perfect fellowship in sin and to the world, but God had a plan.
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:13.660]   And I'm part of that plan, and He will return and redeem fully one day."
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.620]   Preaching a biblical gospel to myself does not start with, "Jesus died for my sins."
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.060]   It starts with, "God had a purpose and a design in creating man, and He is sovereign, and
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.620]   He is good, and He is all-powerful.
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.580]   And God still has a purpose and plan for the redemption of mankind."
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:26.580]   That's epi-achaea.
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:35.100]   I've been doing a one-year Bible plan this year, and I haven't missed a day.
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:40.420]   And it's almost September, and I'm only in Ezekiel.
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:45.660]   According to my plan, I won't get to Matthew until October 5th.
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:50.220]   And as of today, I'm still 40 days and 174 pages in my Bible from getting to the birth
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:54.300]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:59.460]   So remember that all Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, correction,
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:02.540]   reproof, and training in righteousness.
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:06.180]   And he's talking about the Old Testament, actually.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:11.300]   These are the things that are true, honorable, right, pure, lovely, excellent, and of good
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:15.140]   repute that you find in Scripture.
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:18.220]   How do you let your joy be sustained?
[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:26.420]   You pray, and you feast off of God's Word.
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:31.820]   And lastly, the things, verse 9, "You have learned and received and heard in me.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:37.920]   Practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you."
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:43.700]   Love the Word, live the Word, eat the Word, practice the Word.
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:49.980]   So my question is, are you living in obedience to this command to be joyful always?
[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:54.600]   Have you been fueling your joy in the redemption that has come through Jesus Christ by feeding
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:58.160]   daily and often through His Word?
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:03.900]   If you haven't, the point of this is not to drive you to feel guilty or to grieve, okay?
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.700]   It's not to feel like, "Hey, you're not being joyful?
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:06.820]   Hey, you're a joyless Christian.
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:07.900]   Like, wake up."
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.780]   That's not the point of this message.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:19.780]   I want to look at Nehemiah 8, 8 through 12, and we're going to close with this.
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:25.340]   They read from the book, from the law of God, translating to give the sense so that they
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:28.020]   understood the reading.
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:32.700]   Then Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:38.120]   taught the people, said to all the people, "This day is holy to the Lord your God.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.540]   Do not mourn or weep."
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:44.580]   For all the people were weeping when they heard the words of the law.
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:49.380]   Then he said to them, "Go, eat of the fat, drink of the sweet, and send portions to him
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:50.980]   who has nothing prepared.
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:52.780]   For this day is holy to our Lord.
[00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:58.180]   Do not be grieved, for the joy of the Lord is your strength."
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:03.320]   So the Levites calmed all the people, saying, "Be still, for the day is holy.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.820]   Do not be grieved."
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:09.540]   All the people went away to eat, to drink, to send portions, and to celebrate a great
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:16.060]   festival because they understood the words which had been made known to them.
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:19.300]   In Nehemiah 8, 8, a revival is in progress.
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:23.060]   Ezra and some scribes are reading God's word to the people from dawn until noon for like
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:24.500]   six, seven, eight hours.
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.660]   They're reading the word of God.
[00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:32.180]   The people responded by weeping in repentance as they realized how badly they had failed
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.780]   the Lord.
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:39.700]   But Nehemiah and Ezra and the other leaders tell the people not to mourn or weep on this
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:42.740]   day but to party it up.
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:43.980]   Why?
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:49.780]   God has deemed this day holy, and the joy of the Lord is to be what fuels them, what
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:51.780]   drives them.
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:43:01.780]   And I want to close with just us looking at Philippians 4, 4 through 9 again.
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:07.260]   Rejoice in the Lord always, again I will say, rejoice.
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:14.140]   Let your battle-tested Christian wisdom be made known to all men for the Lord is near
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:16.940]   and soon.
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:22.660]   And be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:27.180]   let your requests be made known to God.
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:36.020]   The peace of God which is beyond, surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and
[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:41.140]   your minds in Christ Jesus like a fortress.
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:45.780]   And brothers, finally, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:50.460]   is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence in
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:57.860]   anything worthy of praise that you find in the truth of the gospel message of Jesus Christ,
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:01.180]   you obsess yourself over these things.
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:10.500]   And the things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in the likes of Paul and
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:15.580]   other heroes of faith in the scripture, practice these things and the God of peace will be
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:19.820]   with you.
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:26.940]   My prayer is that the joy of the Lord fuels everything in this church.
[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.380]   Amen?
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:32.500]   May the joy of the Lord be your strength.
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.900]   May the joy of the Lord be my strength.
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:46.660]   Not the burden, not the guilt, not the call, but may His joy be the strength of all that
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:48.380]   we do.
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:49.940]   Amen?
[00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:56.060]   Let's pray together.
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:45:09.500]   Father, we thank you that our salvation is not based on how faithful we are, that eternal
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:16.540]   life was not a payment but it was a gift.
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:21.620]   And Lord, we all have spiritual ADD, all of us have hearts that are prone to wander, but
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:34.780]   we thank you that you saw this, loved us anyway, and opened up an invitation that we come.
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:41.380]   Lord, I pray that you would renew our strength, that you would give us joy.
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:48.020]   And Lord, I pray that as we feast on the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ, that the world
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:56.540]   around us will know that you indeed are good, worthy of trust, worthy of worship.
[00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.540]   We love you, Lord.
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:05.060]   Thank you for giving us a reason to be joyful, to be hopeful, and to persevere in this walk.
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:06.260]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:07.100]   Bye.
