[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   with me to Romans chapter 8. I'm going to be reading from verse 16 all the way to verse
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:19.720]   25. Romans chapter 8 verse 16 to 25. Okay, reading out of the ESV, "The Spirit Himself
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.280]   bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.760]   of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with Him in order that we may also
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.760]   be glorified with Him. For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.040]   worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the creation waits
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.600]   with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.680]   to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it in hope that the creation
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.560]   itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.760]   of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.400]   in the pains of childbirth until now, and not only the Creator, but we ourselves who
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.680]   have the first fruit of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption,
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.760]   as sons, the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we are saved. Now hope that is
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.720]   seen is not hope for we, for who hopes for what he sees. But if we hope for what we do
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:28.800]   not see, we wait for it with patience. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we pray that You would
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:37.560]   anoint Your Word, and that as it goes forth, that it would reveal, minister to, encourage,
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.160]   and shape our own hearts and our lives according to Your will and purpose. We pray, Lord God,
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.680]   as we come in weakness, that Your Spirit, Lord God, would make us strong. Help us to
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.560]   be resolved more than just hearing, but that our very lives will be changed as a result
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.640]   of what we know of You. Help us, Lord God, to see a greater glimpse of Christ and His
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.760]   glory, that we would be changed, Lord God, day to day. We entrust this time to You, Lord,
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:17.080]   in Jesus' name we pray, amen. You know, as I mentioned to you before, we're studying
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:25.900]   the book of Romans, and if there was any one particular book that, to me, not that any
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.400]   other passages in the Bible is not as great, and obviously every part of the Bible is inspired
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.640]   by God, but if there's one book that I would commend to you to really dive into and study
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.160]   and to know it well, it would be the book of Romans. Because the book of Romans is not
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.940]   written to deal with any one particular problem. Paul writes to the Galatians and Philippians,
[00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.200]   and he has many things that he covers in these things, but they all deal with a particular
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.000]   thing that was on Paul's mind, and he deals with that. And so the Gospel message is mentioned,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.520]   but it's mentioned with certain emphasis. The book of Romans is really Christianity
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.040]   in a nutshell, all of it. There's no one particular thing that he mentions above everything
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.720]   else. It's all of it is mentioned, all of it he dives into. So I would say, you know,
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.560]   if there's any one book that we really should know well what it has to say, it would be
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.000]   the book of Romans. But in the book of Romans, if we were to pick a chapter that really summarizes
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.080]   the thoughts and intentions and theology of the whole book of Romans, it would be chapter
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.960]   eight. So if we were to take time and really want to dive into it, I mean, we really could,
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.320]   and I'm not trying to milk it, we really could spend probably months and months and maybe
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.720]   a half a year just studying the book of Romans chapter eight alone, because so much is contained
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.680]   in this chapter. And so I hesitate to go through it too fast, even three or four verses at
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.000]   a time, because we have to skim through a lot of these things, the meaning behind all
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.080]   of these things, in order for us to be able to cover it in a reasonable amount of time.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.840]   So I just commend this book to you. I commend this particular chapter to you. If you were
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.520]   to memorize any chapter in the book, this is the chapter that I really would commend
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.160]   to you to know it by heart, let it shape your thought, let it shape your thinking, and it'll
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.320]   affect the way you praise God, how you view the universe and what God is doing. I want
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.960]   to see what we're talking about today. The subject that we're talking about is Christian
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.400]   suffering. I think it is relevant, no matter when I preach this, when this is preached,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.920]   this is relevant at all times, because I can't remember a single time, whether our church
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:41.320]   was small, we had 30 or 40 people, or larger than, large as our church has become, I can't
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.400]   think of any particular time that I've ever been in ministry where there wasn't somebody
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.960]   in church that was suffering because something going on. Some of it I'm aware of, some of
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.800]   it you guys are aware of, and some of it you guys are not aware of. But this idea of Christian
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.360]   suffering, it is so relevant, so important to us that we have a proper understanding
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.880]   in the context of what Paul says, in particular in this text. So before I dive into it, I
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.560]   want you to understand that we don't deal with this separately from what Paul is saying.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.840]   Paul, I'm not going to go through all of it, but remember in chapter 6, Paul begins to
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.200]   answer the question, if salvation is by grace alone, if you say that it's not by your works,
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.000]   not what you do, but simply by the grace of God that we're saved, isn't that going to
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.840]   lead to a generation of people who are going to say, "Well, let sin that grace may abound,
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.080]   it doesn't matter, that's how great our God is, that no matter what He does, He loves
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.640]   us and we can do whatever we want." Isn't it going to lead to a life of licentiousness?
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:49.800]   And Paul says, "Absolutely not." By no means. If an individual has truly been united with
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:56.800]   Christ, he died with Christ, he was resurrected with Christ, and the Holy Spirit has been
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:03.240]   put into him. So it wasn't simply that, that our sins were forgiven, but we've also been
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.040]   delivered from the power of sin. And that's why the Bible often talks about redemption
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.320]   and deliverance, right? Not simply for the penalty of sin, but the power of sin has been
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.340]   broken because of the presence of the Holy Spirit. So Paul has been talking about in
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:27.040]   chapter 7 how the power of the Holy Spirit has caused us to be delivered from bondage,
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.040]   but not only did we get delivered from bondage, we were made to be children of God, sons of
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.280]   God, to call Him our Abba Father, and as a result of that, we have become co-heirs with
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:45.240]   Christ. So again, up to that point, the Holy Spirit, He didn't just nullify our sins, He
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:53.440]   elevated us to be co-heirs, that we have access to this Father. Now having said all of that,
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:00.200]   all of that is all orthodox, right? We agree on all of that. But how do we understand this
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:07.000]   salvation? If you misapply your understanding of salvation, if we project my understanding
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.560]   of salvation to this Gospel message, a lot of strange doctrines and practices come out
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.320]   of misapplying what we think salvation is. Years ago, when the Charismatic Movement was
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:24.880]   in full swing, probably about 20-25 years ago, probably more than that, maybe closer
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.480]   to 30 years ago, the Charismatic Movement was called the Third Wave of the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.340]   And there was a, the Charismatic Movement, the modern day, the singing and praising and
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.480]   band and all of this, this all came in during that period. Because prior to that, it was,
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.120]   if you were contemporary, you had one guy playing guitar, right? Typically it was an
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.520]   organ or a piano, and that would be a traditional, and then contemporary would be one guy playing
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:53.480]   guitar. But during the Charismatic Movement, the worship style changed drastically. Now
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.400]   all of that stuff is just a matter of style, whether you play organ or full praise team,
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.440]   that has nothing to do with genuine worship. But one of the things that was being taught
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:09.680]   at that time during this Charismatic Movement was that if you genuinely believe in God,
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:15.240]   God will and can heal you, whatever disease you have. So there was these healing services
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.280]   that were going on, even in conservative Presbyterian churches, Baptist churches, all of a sudden
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.760]   were having these healing services because, again, the central figure during this time
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.180]   was a man named John Wimber, who was the leader of the Vineyard Movement. The Vineyard Church
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.600]   still exists today, but the leader of the Vineyard Movement basically was teaching that
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:38.920]   if you believe, if you have genuine faith, that whatever ails you, God can heal. So they
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.360]   would have traditional worship. Today we have, you know, we have the regular worship, and
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.840]   you have the contemporary worship. Well, during that time you had the contemporary worship,
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.880]   and then healing service, right? All of a sudden healing services were popping up left
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:57.960]   and right. But the problem with this movement was that John Wimber, who was the chief proponent
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:03.920]   of this theology, got cancer. So everybody was watching. Well, he was telling everybody
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:08.400]   that if you really believe, and people would say, "Well, I went to a healing service. I
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.000]   didn't get healed." It was because you didn't have true faith. If you really had true faith,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.200]   you would have been healed. So the problem is with you, not me, right? Well, he got cancer,
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.640]   and so obviously people were watching and praying, and years went by, and there were
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.680]   periods where they said, "Oh, he's better. He's not better." But eventually he passed
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:30.120]   away because of his cancer. And so that confused a lot of people who were fully 100% in this
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:35.000]   movement, and there was no big turnaround saying, "That was wrong." It was just kind
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.420]   of fizzled out. And that's why it's just not, you know, these days you don't hear a lot
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:44.720]   about it, but about 20, 30 years ago, it was just as popular as anything that you would
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:51.640]   see today. It's because in their mind, even though they had the correct gospel, their
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:57.720]   application, what salvation meant. Salvation meant that you're going to be physically healed.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.040]   Something I think a little bit more relevant today that's been around for a long time is
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:06.960]   the health and wealth gospel. I remember years ago, there was a popular speaker, and again,
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:13.220]   this man named Fred Price was a pastor of a very large church, a mega church in LA,
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.400]   and his church was called the Faith Dome. And it used to be a sports arena that he turned
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:22.120]   it into his church, and he had tens of thousands of people meeting there. And then every Sunday
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.520]   morning he would preach. And I didn't know his theology. I just thought, "Oh, this guy's
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.200]   a really good communicator." So I would listen to him every once in a while. But I remember
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:36.400]   one Sunday he had people stand up and he said, "Anybody here who's on welfare stand up."
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.000]   And people very reluctantly stood up. And when they stood up, he just ripped into them.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.400]   And he said, "The reason why you guys are on welfare is because you don't have enough
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:49.400]   faith. God can deliver you from poverty." And he would just rip on them. And obviously,
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.640]   you know, I'm watching this, I'm cringing. And then the next thing he would have them
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.000]   sit down. And then he said, "Those of you who used to be on welfare, who used to be
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.480]   poor, didn't have a job, but now you do." And then you get up. And everybody gets up
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.960]   and people start clapping. It's because these people believed. And God delivered them from
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:11.640]   poverty. And whatever sickness they had, God delivered them. And people would all clap,
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.240]   and then he would begin to share about his wealth. You know, and that's why, because
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:21.480]   if you have faith like his, you can have this wealth yourself. Right? Now you guys are at
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.360]   a Bible teaching church, so we look at that and say, "That's ridiculous. Why would people
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:33.520]   even fall for that?" Right? We don't believe it on paper. We never signed a doctrinal statement.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:39.400]   But if we examine ourselves carefully, you will find just how prominent this health and
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:48.600]   wealth gospel is, even in your life. How often do we equate the love of God and his grace
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:55.240]   with a good job? How often do we question his goodness when we pray for good health
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:01.880]   and it doesn't come? How often do we celebrate and thank God when God answers our prayer
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:08.800]   and we get a raise? And when that doesn't happen, we question, "Why didn't God answer?"
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.240]   Because suddenly, we would never say we're part of the health and wealth gospel movement.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:19.280]   But when something is not the way that you think it ought to be, you think something
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:25.320]   is wrong. I must have done something wrong. Or maybe God isn't even real. How much of
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:32.960]   the application of what we consider to be Orthodox Christian faith is mixed in with
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.880]   this ideology of what I think salvation means. Now, why do I say all of this? It's because
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:44.160]   Paul qualifies that by the Holy Spirit, we have become co-heirs with Christ. Well, if
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:50.040]   I'm co-heir with Christ, if I become a child of the living God who created the universe,
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:58.920]   then all things is mine. No more suffering. No more hunger. So Paul, again, he's been
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:04.060]   arguing now, in case that you get a wrong understanding what salvation is, he says in
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:09.800]   verse 17, "If children, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:16.160]   we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him." It's kind of like,
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.080]   you know, build them up. You've been delivered, you're a child of God, call him Abba Father,
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:26.360]   you're co-heirs with Christ, as long as you continue to suffer with him. Wah, wah, wah.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:35.540]   So all this build up to make sure that you don't misapply what it means to be saved.
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:42.460]   Today we're going to be looking at, I think, three principles that Paul teaches about suffering
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:47.220]   in this particular text. That we have a biblical ideology, biblical application, what it means
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:53.300]   to be saved. And where suffering plays a role. The first thing that we need to understand
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:14:02.020]   is that Paul, in this particular context, is talking about suffering of all the world.
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:06.360]   Suffering is a state of all the fallen world. That's the first principle that we want to
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:12.020]   look at. Now, he does start in verse 17 by specifically mentioning Christian suffering.
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:17.960]   He says, "Provided that we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:25.820]   him." Suffering here is, again, he begins with Christian suffering, but Christian suffering
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:32.100]   is within the context of the larger suffering that he mentions about the creation. He says,
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.620]   "Of the creation," Romans 8.20, "the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly,
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:41.720]   but because of him who subjected it." Now, the creation isn't suffering because of persecution.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:47.200]   Creation's not suffering because it's obedience to the Word of God. He's talking about creation
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:56.020]   and its suffering because we all live in this fallen world, universally. Every single human
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:03.580]   being experiences this suffering, Christian or non-Christian alike. You know, when we
[00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:07.960]   go through suffering, we have a tendency to isolate ourselves, to think that nobody understands
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:14.740]   me. Nobody understands. Nobody understands what I've gone through. Nobody has seen, nobody
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:18.980]   knows what my family is like. Nobody knows the financial problems. Nobody knows the health
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:25.800]   issues. Nobody knows the relationship that we have. And when we begin to isolate ourselves,
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:32.180]   you make your suffering unique that nobody else knows but you. But the Scripture clearly
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:42.180]   says, and again, for 28, 27 years of ministry, I can guarantee you, whether you are old or
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:46.620]   whether you are young, whether you are rich, whether you come from a broken family or a
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:52.620]   together family, whatever your background may be, your brothers and sisters who are
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:58.360]   sitting around you are suffering the same. They're suffering the same. The loneliness
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:03.460]   that you feel, even in the large context, that's not unique to you. That's not unique
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:12.660]   to you. Feeling like you don't belong, that's not unique to you. Feeling like you've been
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:18.340]   chipped in life, that's not unique to you. Your inability to communicate with your husband
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:27.620]   and wife, that's not unique to you. Whatever struggles that you may have experienced, the
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:33.980]   Scripture clearly tells us that this is the experience of mankind because we've all fallen.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:41.500]   Paul says in Romans 8, 20, of all the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly,
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:48.060]   but because of him who subjected it. He says all of creation has experienced this. See
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:53.980]   in Genesis chapter 3, 17 to 19, when the Bible talks about the corruption and the suffering
[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:59.860]   that was going to come upon man, it wasn't just man he isolates. He says in verse 17,
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:08.500]   "Cursed is the ground because of you." If you remember, all of creation was created
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:15.980]   first and then God created Adam and Eve the very last. He created life. He created food.
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:24.900]   All of it to sustain man on the sixth day. And then he told man to rule over his creation.
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:30.860]   So his job was to rule over it, to subdue it, to be caretakers. So when Adam and Eve
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:37.140]   fell, not only did Adam and Eve fall, everything that God created for Adam and Eve also became
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:43.100]   corrupt. He says, "Cursed is the ground because of you. In pain you shall eat of it all the
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:50.260]   days of your life. Thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you." This is a common
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:55.460]   experience of all mankind. "You shall eat the plants of the field by the sweat of your
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:18:01.140]   face. You shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you are taken,
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:08.540]   for you are dust, and to dust you shall return." All of mankind, all of mankind, Christian
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:14.660]   and non-Christian alike, rich or poor, whether you are born in this country or in the Middle
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:20.500]   East or anywhere else, the scripture says life is going to be difficult. Suffering is
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:27.220]   going to come as a result of this fall. And as a result of that, in Romans 8.20, he says,
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:31.740]   "In hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage and decay and obtain
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:37.660]   the freedom of the glory of the children of God." So restoration is not simply mankind
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:42.020]   being restored and him being saved. He says, "With the restoration of mankind, all of
[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:49.020]   creation will also be restored." In Isaiah 65.25, "The wolf and the lamb shall graze
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:55.420]   together. The lion shall eat straw like the ox, and dust shall be serpent's food. They
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:02.620]   shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountains, says the Lord." So when he describes salvation
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:09.180]   and restoration, he describes not only the salvation of Adam and Eve, mankind, but through
[00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:14.220]   them all the other things that were corrupt, all the other things that were condemned will
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:20.220]   also be restored. So when Isaiah says in Isaiah 65.25, "The wolf and the lamb shall graze
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:25.260]   together. The lion shall eat straw like the ox." Basically what he's saying is that's
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:31.060]   not how God created the universe. The way, what you and I see, the reason why a lion
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:37.620]   doesn't walk in the midst of us, all of that happened because of the fall. He said,
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:44.620]   "We live in danger." If you've ever read statistics about the dangerous animals of
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:50.300]   how many people get killed by lions or elephants or mosquitoes or sharks, and always in the
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:57.180]   top of that list is man killing man. See this corruption came in because of the fall, not
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:01.980]   just human beings, but all of creation. So when God restores, he says he will restore
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:10.780]   all that was lost in creation. Suffering characterizes mankind and all its creation.
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:15.220]   Revelation 21.1-2, "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:20.140]   the first earth had passed away and the sea was no more. And I saw the holy city, New
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:26.940]   Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband."
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:31.780]   Just like in the Lord's prayer, our prayer is, "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:36.980]   earth as it is in heaven." That what was lost in creation will be restored. So the
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:45.500]   Lord's prayer is the restoration of mankind, what God desired. You know, sometimes you
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:50.980]   see on Facebook or news where people talking about, you know, we have to save the planet
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:54.580]   and we have, you know, and all of these things are true. We need to be good stewards of what
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:21:03.220]   God has given us. But we forget, sometimes even as Christians, the reason why the earth
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:13.180]   and the creation is in the state that it's in is not because we're burning plastic. That's
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:17.380]   what the world says. The problem is that if we were just a little bit more careful, if
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:22.180]   we rode electric cars, that we can fix this universe. The scripture says all of that happened
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:28.060]   in the beginning. The decay happened as a result of the fall of man. So restoration
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:35.220]   is going to happen when man is restored to what God intended. You know, being overly
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.820]   concerned about our planet is kind of like coming from a broken home and your primary
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:45.900]   concern is if the dog is eating. We're arguing about, "Did the dog get the right food? Is
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:50.860]   he walking enough while your husband and wife isn't eating, while your kids aren't eating?"
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:22:00.100]   See, the scriptures tells us that all of creation is eagerly waiting. And as a result of all
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:05.260]   of this, Romans 8.22, "For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:12.020]   in the pains of childbirth until now." All of creation since the fall has been groaning.
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:20.380]   What does groaning mean? Like when do you groan? When there's a deep-seated suffering,
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:30.660]   emotions that you can't express with words. We groan. All of creation, and it is not just
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:36.020]   you. It is not your circumstance. It is not simply you. Even though at times when you're
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:40.580]   going through suffering, you think like you're the only person in this universe that knows
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:53.780]   what you're going through. The whole world, all of creation is groaning. You know, in
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:23:00.340]   Ecclesiastes, as you know, King Solomon, everything that you and I can possibly imagine, King
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:06.660]   Solomon had opportunity to do. If he wanted to travel, he could go anywhere he wanted.
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:12.620]   For food, concubines, all the wealth that you can possibly, anything that you can possibly
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:19.620]   imagine that you and I sometimes entertain. Winning the lottery for King Solomon would
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:26.820]   be a joke to him. That's how much money he had. He experienced all of that, and the end
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:31.300]   conclusion of all of it, as you guys know, he says, "Vanity, vanity, all is vanity."
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:38.660]   Nothing is new under the sun. Ever since before him, ever since after him, everybody has been
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:45.500]   pursuing thinking the answer is in something else. But the end result is, it is empty.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:58.320]   It is empty. All he found was more groaning. More groaning. This is the state of all mankind.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:04.500]   It is because of this groaning Christ came. It is to relieve us from this groaning why
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:13.140]   Christ was crucified on the cross. But here's what's unique about us, the number two, right?
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:18.420]   This suffering isn't necessarily unique to Christians, but it is unique to us in this
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:24.640]   sense. Suffering reveals the genuineness of our faith, okay? Number two. Second principle.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.820]   Suffering reveals for Christians the genuineness of our faith. In Romans 8, 17, "And if children
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:34.460]   then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:42.380]   order that we may also be glorified with him." He says, "Well, how do you know the Holy Spirit
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:50.560]   is in you? How do you know that you're a child of God?" He says, "Suffering. Suffering does."
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:59.540]   When suffering comes, where does relief come for you? When suffering comes in your life,
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:06.580]   what is your answer? Who do you seek? Where do you find your comfort? There's a reason
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:11.940]   why the scripture tells us not to be hasty in laying hands, to take time to test, to
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:18.020]   test a man. Well, what does it mean to test a man? Does he take a test? Right? Is there
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:22.140]   an exam that he takes? And it's sad to say in our generation, you know, if you want to
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:27.420]   get ordained, go to school, learn your theology, and take a test. And if you pass a test, you
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:33.180]   become a pastor. Right? And I always thought that was strange. Like somebody becomes a
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:40.140]   pastor like you become a lawyer. If you know these facts, you become a pastor. Well, that's
[00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:46.740]   not what testing means in scripture. Testing means some men, since they're obvious, some
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:53.100]   men since trail behind them. Let time and circumstance and trials test them to see the
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:26:00.900]   genuineness of their faith. You probably heard this before, but it's like a sponge. In your
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:05.500]   kitchen you have a sponge and whoever washed dishes before, if they did a good job cleaning
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:09.460]   that sponge before they left, and you really don't know what's in that sponge until you
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:15.260]   take it and you squeeze it. And then you find all this brown water coming out because whoever
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:19.780]   washed dishes before didn't thoroughly clean it. And you didn't know what was in there
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:30.700]   until you squeezed it. In the same way, suffering reveals. Suffering reveals where you turn
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:36.640]   to why you two people can experience the same kind of suffering where one person comes out
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:42.140]   praising God and thanking him that the suffering caused them to get closer to God. Where the
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:46.380]   other person that even a little bit of suffering causes them to be bitter and angry toward
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:56.100]   God and everybody else. What was the difference? It was their faith. Believing that a sovereign
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:01.980]   God who loves them is sovereignly in control causes that individual to seek a greater glimpse
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:08.220]   of his glory. Where a person who doesn't have faith, all they see is darkness and they don't
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:19.180]   see hope. Suffering reveals the genuineness of our faith. See Matthew 16, 24, Jesus said,
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:23.460]   from the very get-go, "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:29.500]   his cross and follow me." It is not because God doesn't want us to be happy or is it kill
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:43.300]   joy? Our very idea, our very impulse for life has been corrupted. You ever wonder why all
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:48.940]   the things that we crave usually for food are bad for us? Wouldn't it be awesome if
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:54.900]   you were born with a craving for only good stuff? Why do we have to resist candy and
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:28:06.100]   stuff? I have too many things on my head to share all at once. Why is it, I mean, think
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:13.100]   about even the lust that God intended for your wife and your husband. Why is it not
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:19.180]   romantic in the world? Why is it whenever they have sexual context on television or
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:29.140]   movies it's always, always outside of the wedding? Pornography is sex that has been
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:34.340]   corrupted. All our senses have been corrupted. So when he says, "If you want to live, you
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:43.580]   need to first deny yourself because yourself, your very senses have been corrupted." Suffering
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:50.540]   comes into our lives and he puts pressure to reveal that we've been chasing after things
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:56.980]   that are corrupted. He takes our eyes off of these things that we easily get distracted
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:03.680]   in to focus on him. John 12, 25, 26, "Whoever loves his life, loses it and whoever hates
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:09.540]   his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. If anyone serves me, he must follow
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:13.980]   me and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:22.820]   honor him." Our very desire to live and what we think is going to bring life has been corrupted.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:29.740]   So God oftentimes will bring suffering in our lives to force us, to cause us to take
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:34.460]   our eyes off of whatever it is that we have been distracted by. Whatever it is that you
[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:41.540]   have convinced yourself is going to bring joy and satisfaction and to fix our eyes upon
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:49.260]   him. I mean, what James says in chapter 1, 2-4, "Count it all joy, my brothers, when
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:56.540]   you meet trials of various kinds." It's another thing to endure it, to persevere in it. But
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:07.260]   he says to rejoice in it. How can you possibly expect people to rejoice when suffering comes?
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:12.940]   But here's the reason why he says, "Rejoice, for you know that the testing of your faith,
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:18.620]   the proving of your faith produces steadfastness. And steadfastness has its full effect that
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:23.300]   you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing." In other words, he's saying God
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:30.900]   has bringing various kinds of suffering in our lives to bring us to completion. And what
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:39.660]   is this completion? What is this end goal of salvation? Isn't it to bring us to him?
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:46.620]   Isn't that what we talked about? The Holy Spirit was deposited in us to embrace us,
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:51.860]   to carry us on his shoulder and bring us to him. So when he says, "When various trials
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:56.740]   have come in and produces endurance and steadfastness and the end result is completeness," what
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:05.820]   is this completeness? Isn't that another way of saying to bring us to him? That God's avenue
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:15.960]   to bring us salvation is through suffering? And the reason why it's suffering is because
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:29.840]   our idea of peace produces death. Our idea of joy in this world produces death and condemnation.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:40.700]   Our idea of comfort and who we run to produces condemnation. That's why he brings suffering.
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:46.320]   He puts pressure so that we may take our eyes off of whatever it is that we have been distracted
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:52.520]   by and to remind us salvation is in him and him alone.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:32:00.600]   Third principle, ultimately suffering and glory go hand in hand. Suffering and glory
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:06.040]   go hand in hand. Again, Romans 8.16, it says, "The Spirit of himself bears witness with
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:10.300]   our spirit that we are children of God. And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, fellow
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:15.420]   heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:24.260]   with him." To be glorified with him. He brings suffering into our lives, ultimately not to
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:34.240]   bring affliction, but to bring glory. 2 Corinthians 4.17, "For this slight momentary affliction,"
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.340]   and again, when Paul says momentary affliction, this slight momentary affliction, we're talking
[00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:44.700]   about, again, understanding the context of Apostle Paul being beaten, shipwrecked. People
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:49.260]   who are preaching the gospel to put pressure on him within the church, questioning his
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:56.420]   apostleship, possibly dying because of his faith. So when he says slight momentary affliction,
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:02.900]   we're talking about risking his life, possibly ending any day. But the reason why he says
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:09.380]   slight momentary affliction, because of what it produces, in light of what God is trying
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:16.420]   to do, is preparing for us eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison. It is in comparison
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:24.980]   that even risking his life, he says it calls it slight momentary affliction, in light of
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:29.700]   the glory that is waiting. As we look not to the things that are seen, but to the things
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:34.780]   that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:43.940]   are eternal. When affliction comes into our lives, and it can come through relationships,
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:50.580]   it can be financial, it can be health, whatever it may be, when affliction comes to our life,
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:58.660]   our immediate response, our fleshly response, is to find an alternative. That's why, you
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:05.300]   know, when you're young, when something goes wrong, you start to think, maybe if I was
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:11.580]   with somebody else, right? And if you're in a job that you don't like, and something happens,
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:17.460]   and I'm not saying there isn't a good time to move on, but our immediate thought is,
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:24.020]   change our circumstance, change the people that are around us. But after a while, after
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:30.060]   you've made significant changes, after you've done that four, five, six, seven times, you
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:37.060]   realize that everybody sucks. Okay, excuse my language. Right? And some of you guys are
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:44.380]   sitting here thinking that. I've been there. They suck too. You know? We do that with churches.
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:50.940]   We do that with people, circumstance, whatever it may be. You know? Whenever affliction or
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:55.180]   trials and we're uncomfortable, we just think that, oh, maybe if we change this, we change
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:35:01.580]   that, it'll fix that. But after a while, you realize all have sinned and fall short of
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:10.980]   the glory of God, including you. See, God brings afflictions in our lives not to cause
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:19.180]   us to look for better circumstance. God brings pressure into our lives so that we could take
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:27.620]   our eyes off of whatever it is that you've placed your hope in and to look to him. I
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:37.340]   remember years back when I was a younger pastor, one of the things that would really frustrate
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:46.700]   me is I underestimated the suffering of people. You know? I spent a lot of time in LA, so
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:51.540]   I thought suffering was in LA, not in Irvine. You know? So I remember the very first Bible
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:57.380]   study that I led at Irvine Baptist. I sat around and I prepared this Bible study about,
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:03.060]   you know, about bad relationship with parents and, you know, and drugs. You know, all the
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.580]   stuff that I prepared. And so I sat down with the youth group and I asked them, how many
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:12.060]   of you have good relationship with your parents that you can actually talk to them? 95% said,
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:17.180]   yeah, we have a good relationship. And I remember thinking, this Bible study is not going to
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:23.780]   be relevant, you know, to this group. Right? But again, that's superficial, very superficial.
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:27.700]   There's a tendency to think, well, if you live in a rich area, you know, where everybody's
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:33.140]   have it together, suffering is not there. Right? Absolutely false. You know, all the
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:39.020]   years that I've been here, suffering is, it looks different here. You know, it's various
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:45.020]   kinds is different. But I remember sitting in front of people who were sharing with me
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.700]   all kinds of trials. I mean, just some of these things are shocking things that I've
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:55.620]   heard and just feeling so inadequate because what I learned in seminary was how to exposit
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:37:02.260]   the Bible. Basically, that's it. That's what I learned how to do. Exposit the Bible, right?
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:06.180]   How to use commentaries and look at the Greek and the Hebrew and the culture. And I've done
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:10.860]   that. Even preaching, I get one class. You just kind of figure that out on your own.
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:17.300]   You know, in the communion, I just figured I just kind of winged it. Baptism. I saw my
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:21.860]   friends do it, so I did it the way he did it. You know, we were taught how to exposit
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:26.060]   the Bible. That's what we were taught. And I remember just coming out of these counseling
[00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.940]   meetings just frustrated, thinking like, I need to go back to school and get a counseling
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:35.500]   degree. You know, I need to go back to school and learn psychology or something because
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:42.660]   it just doesn't seem enough. And they're frustrated. I'm frustrated. And I remember just thinking
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:52.500]   through all of the frustration. Is that the way it was meant to be? And the more I searched
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:38:00.700]   through scripture, the solution came only one way. There's only one answer given in
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:10.460]   the scripture for all the problem of mankind. And you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:16.660]   That every problem, every family problem, every marriage, every problem that is revealed
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:28.620]   in scripture, the answer was Christ and Christ alone. And I realized that if I give solution
[00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:36.700]   to any human problem, to anything else but Christ, eventually you're going to be frustrated.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:43.500]   I can find you the right people to meet up with on a regular basis. But if you think
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:48.620]   that finding the right people in your life is going to solve your problem, eventually
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:57.500]   you're going to be frustrated. Finding the right church, a right job, learning how to
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:05.500]   say the right things, eventually all of those things are going to fail. Here's what it says
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:11.620]   in 1 Peter 5.10. "And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:19.700]   has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen,
[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:30.500]   and establish you." Who's going to strengthen you? Not other people. Not your wife, not
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:40.820]   your husband, not your pastor, not your church, not your friends, not your small group leader,
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:50.300]   not your discipler. Christ, he himself will restore you. He will confirm you. He will
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:59.860]   strengthen you. He will establish you. God brings suffering in our lives to press things
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:09.380]   in our lives, to remind us why he came. He didn't come to point us to the right direction.
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:15.300]   He came and he says, "I am the way and the truth and the life. I am the way and the truth
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:23.740]   and the life." C.S. Lewis says of pain, "Pain insists upon being attended to. God whispers
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:32.660]   to us in our pleasures, speaks in our consciences, but shouts in our pains. It is his megaphone
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:41.580]   to rouse a deaf world." That's why in Romans 8, 18, it says, "For I consider the suffering
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:48.980]   of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us."
[00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:56.140]   For Christians, suffering reminds us this is not our home. When things aren't going
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:05.140]   right in your life, it reminds us this is not your home. Your retirement is not your
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:14.420]   destiny. Right investment is not your destiny. See, when the world suffers, they're in despair
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:19.820]   because there's no hope in their suffering. But Christian suffering is unique in that
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:25.100]   a sovereign and loving God is absolutely is in control. And that's why in Philippines
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:29.060]   1, 29, it says, "For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ, you should
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:35.700]   not only believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake." Because it is in our suffering
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:44.700]   that we see Christ the clearest. See, the Lord is near to those who are brokenhearted
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:53.420]   and saves the crushed in spirit. Let me conclude with this in 2 Corinthians 4. Knowing what
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:42:02.180]   we know of suffering, knowing what we know about Christ. 2 Corinthians 4, 16 to 18, "So
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:07.340]   we do not lose heart. Though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:12.660]   renewed day by day. For this slight momentary affliction is preparing for us eternal weight
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:17.780]   of glory beyond all comprehension. As we look not to the things that are seen, but to the
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:22.260]   things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:27.220]   are unseen are eternal." 2 Corinthians 4, 7. "But we have this treasure in charge of
[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:33.940]   clay to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us. We are afflicted in
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:41.220]   every way, but not crushed. Perplexed, but not driven to despair. Persecuted, but not
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:56.660]   forsaken. Struck down, but not destroyed." Let's pray. As our worship team comes up,
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:05.380]   again, I want to invite you to come to the Lord. And I know some of you may be in anguish
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:16.780]   this morning. Maybe you've been in anguish for a long time. Come to the Lord. Cast all
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:23.140]   your anxiety before Him because He cares for you. The whole benefit of salvation is that
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:30.460]   we have this access to our Abba Father who hears our groanings. And if what I'm saying
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:38.900]   to you is not you, if you are oblivious to the sufferings of the people around you, you
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:50.360]   need to wake up too. That your life is content with all the people, Christians and non-Christians
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:59.700]   alike are groaning and you've become insensitive to their groaning. You need to wake up too.
[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:04.660]   Let's take some time as we come before the Lord, the condemnation that this world is
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:12.140]   in, that we may be His ambassadors of this life. So let's take some time to pray as we
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:12.860]   come before the Lord.
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.940]   (laughs)
