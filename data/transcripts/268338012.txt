[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 13, I'll be reading from verse 11
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.640]   to 14.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.840]   And this will be a second part of what we started last week.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.520]   Romans chapter 13, 11 through 14.
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.480]   "Besides this, you know the time that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep,
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.280]   for salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.680]   The night is far gone, the day is at hand.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.860]   So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.
[00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.320]   Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality,
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.240]   not in sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.840]   no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires."
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.920]   Let's pray.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.840]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.240]   You are a God who truly is worthy of our affections.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.520]   You're worthy of our lives.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.440]   You're worthy of all that we have.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.200]   Help us, Lord God, to be mindful of what it is that we have in Christ, that we may live
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.720]   lives truly worthy of the gospel you've given us.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.460]   May this time be a blessing to you.
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.840]   Help us, Lord God, to worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.620]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.980]   Last week we looked at the first part of what Paul was saying in verse 11 and on, where
[00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.060]   Paul is urging the church to live with a sense of urgency.
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.380]   Now living in Orange County, the challenge that we have is that nothing external reminds
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.300]   us of this urgency.
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.540]   So we are constantly reminded in the church, in Bible study, sometimes in fellowship, that
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.700]   we ought to be living a certain way.
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.960]   But our environment naturally does not push us toward that direction.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.900]   How do we live with a sense of urgency and not just come to church and just check off
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.720]   and do Bible study, I did quiet time and I did this and I did that, but with a sense
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.080]   of urgency because you know how your spiritual life is affected when you have that sense
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.260]   of urgency.
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.180]   If you've ever been out to short-term missions, you know what that feels like.
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.260]   That short period of time, whether it's 10 days or three weeks or a month, during that
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.540]   short period of time, you're so focused in your energy, we need to evangelize.
[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.780]   You eat certain kind of things.
[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.100]   You sacrifice some of your comfort.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.260]   You get together and you share about what you did during that day.
[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.980]   And then you encourage each other and you go out.
[00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.540]   And so every single day is lived with a sense of urgency.
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.220]   And when you come back, you miss that.
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.960]   And that's part of the benefit of going out to short-term missions because for a short
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.740]   period of time, you're able to live the way God really wants us to live.
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.580]   And for many Christians, that's exactly how we want to live.
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.640]   But how do we live with that sense of urgency while we're at home, taking care of our children,
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.080]   when our bills are paid?
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.460]   You know, there's a kind of urgency that we feel because of our environment.
[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.280]   You know, if you happen to be around certain people who are doing certain things, and just
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.900]   like I mentioned, you go out to short-term missions or you're in the mission field for
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.980]   a period, and your environment causes you to have a sense of urgency.
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.300]   You're surrounded by certain people.
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.880]   Certain events are taking place.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.140]   But the problem with an environmental urgency is that that environment is not dictated by
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.140]   you.
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.540]   And you become dependent.
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.380]   So a lot of people come back from missions always fantasizing about, "What would it be
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.060]   like if I was to live there?"
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.740]   And even though 99% of us will be living here, and a small amount of us experience what it's
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.300]   like to go out to China for a period and then come back, and they begin to live with this
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.380]   like, "Man, I was such a great Christian when I was there.
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.700]   If I was in this group, if I was in that group, it would be different."
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.940]   But the reality is that environment, if our urgency is dictated by our environment, you
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.180]   will always be dependent on whatever environment that you're in.
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.420]   So if you happen to be in a lukewarm environment, you become lukewarm.
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.180]   If you happen to be in an environment where there's a sense of urgency, then you live
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.460]   with this urgency.
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.940]   So the sense of urgency is not coming from within.
[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.940]   Sense of urgency is coming from without.
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.220]   And so our spiritual lives goes up and down based upon who we're with.
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.020]   And then there's circumstantial urgency.
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.900]   Whether you are in the middle of a job, or there's a sickness or illness, or something
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.300]   has happened, persecution is happening, natural disaster, there are certain things that are
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.940]   happening in our life that causes us to be urgent.
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.460]   But even that, if it's based upon our circumstance, we don't have control over that.
[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.860]   We can look at, "Wow, those people were persecuted.
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.380]   They really love Christ and it purifies the church."
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.140]   But what if you're living in a place where the persecution is not happening, where you
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.980]   and I live?
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.940]   The persecution is what's causing the sense of urgency, which it does, but if we're dependent
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.580]   upon that, then we will always be dependent upon our circumstance and whatever is happening
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.580]   around us.
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.700]   So our spiritual life isn't grounded in Christ.
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:17.180]   It's grounded upon whatever changing circumstance or environment that we're in.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.340]   Sometimes God will bring us to those circumstances.
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.420]   Sometimes in our environment, there are things that are external that are going to push us
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.220]   toward that.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.580]   But the kind of urgency that Paul is talking about is not talking about circumstantial
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.900]   or environment.
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:37.500]   He's talking about value or truth-based urgency that does not change because you're young
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.020]   or you're older, or before you were married, or after you were married, or because you
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.580]   have a certain group of friends, or because you don't have a certain group of friends.
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.940]   A certain kind of urgency that comes from believing in the truth of the gospel.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.660]   But like Paul said, when he says, "I have found the secret of being content in every
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.660]   and all situation, having a lot or not having it at all," Paul said that his life and his
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:07.220]   passion for Christ and his joy is not based upon whether he's in prison or out of prison,
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.460]   whether he's being fed or not being fed.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:17.100]   Ultimately, our sense of urgency is grounded in the gospel itself.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:24.020]   We talked about that last week, how the gospel message, "Eugengelion," basically means "good
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.020]   news."
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.460]   And news is meant to be told.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.140]   It's meant to be shared.
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.580]   There's a sense of urgency in the very word "gospel" itself.
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:40.700]   So if our urgency and sense of importance of what we're doing and how we ought to live
[00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:46.320]   isn't grounded on the things that we believe already, and we're constantly waiting for
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:53.340]   something to happen outside of us to move us, sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't.
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.620]   In fact, a lot of times it doesn't.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.060]   In fact, most of the time it doesn't.
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.020]   Most of our lives are lived in the mundane.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.340]   Most of our lives, you go to work in the morning, you clock out at night, you come home, you
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:13.620]   eat your dinner, you take care of your children, and in your fatigue, you try to fit in your
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.180]   quiet time and do what you need to do, and then you put the kids to sleep, and this is
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.100]   what five, six days out of the week it looks like.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:27.980]   Majority of our lives, the environment that we're in doesn't push us toward Christ.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.300]   It doesn't give us a sense of urgency.
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.020]   In fact, it fights against that because we live in a world where everything, especially
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.340]   here in Orange County, where everything is safe, everything is good.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.420]   And every once in a while, you may experience something in your life, whether individually
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:50.300]   or maybe in a large scale, something happens to remind us that we need Christ.
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:55.180]   But if our sense of worship, if our sense of urgency is dependent upon things that are
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:01.620]   outside and not the truth of the gospel, it means that majority of our lives, majority
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:09.060]   of our lives, we're going to be living thinking that it would be great if I was in this situation.
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:14.620]   It would be great if that happened, and living envying other people, envying other circumstances.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.540]   So we read testimonies of pastors who are sacrificing their lives to get the gospel
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.820]   and say, "Wow, that's awesome.
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.700]   I'm really challenged by that."
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.660]   Or every once in a while, you'll hear a missionary or a pastor or somebody who's doing something
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:31.700]   fantastic for God, and we live vicariously through the testimonies of other people.
[00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:39.820]   But for us, we're just living day to day, hoping, frustrated that maybe the circumstances
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.220]   today, only if this changed, only if that changed, only if these people were in my life,
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.020]   only if those people were.
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:53.500]   And we drift from year to year, sometimes decade to decade, not passionately serving
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.860]   Christ as a result.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:09:00.980]   Paul reminded us last week in verse 11 and on, he says four separate times, he says,
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:06.460]   "This thing you know, you know the time, that the hour has come, that the night is
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.260]   far gone, the day is at hand."
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:16.580]   And so he gives a sense of urgency to not only to live for Christ and to honor Christ,
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:22.140]   but to recognize that today, you only have today, today.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.780]   Once today passes, you can't look back and say, "Oh, I wish I could do that again."
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.120]   It's gone.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.340]   You only have your 20s once.
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.380]   You only have your 30s once.
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.060]   You only have your 40s once.
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.180]   You're only single once.
[00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.820]   You only have your children when they're young once.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.860]   And once it passes, it passes.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:43.360]   And that's why the scripture reminds us to redeem the time that God has given us.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.620]   That we would not simply be hearers of the word, but when we hear it, that we would have
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.700]   a sense of urgency today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your heart.
[00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:56.460]   Do not go back into your old routine, but just carefully examine what does it mean to
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.740]   be a follower of Jesus Christ?
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.820]   So this morning, I want to look at three separate things that the scripture teaches in the text
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.180]   that we're looking at.
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.500]   What does it mean to be woke?
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.860]   What does it mean to be woke?
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.660]   Now, I know it's grammatically wrong.
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.100]   And those of you who are already aware, like a lot of you have a smirk on your face, so
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:22.420]   I can already tell you know what I'm getting at.
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.580]   In modern day, the slang that they use for woke, and I'm going to give you the urban
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.580]   dictionary.
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.820]   For those of you who don't know what an urban dictionary is, you're going to have to look
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.820]   it up.
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:33.820]   Okay?
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.320]   So urban dictionary basically is the modern definition of things that are kind of new
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.380]   vocabularies that are coming into the culture.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.380]   Okay?
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.820]   I already made it sound uncool.
[00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.220]   All right, so that's basically what's happening.
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:49.900]   So the urban dictionary, what it means to be woke, if you haven't heard that yet, it
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:54.340]   says getting woke is like being in a matrix and taking the red pill.
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:11:01.500]   So if you don't know the matrix, you're already lost, so I can't help you.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.960]   So those of you who know and you've watched that movie, the greatest movie ever made,
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.860]   you know what I'm talking about.
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.940]   You get a sudden understanding of what's really going on and find out you were wrong about
[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.800]   much of what you understood to be truth.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.340]   So to be woke basically means that you were thinking one way and all of a sudden something
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.180]   happens, you're enlightened, and you're able to see the world in a completely different
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.180]   light.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.180]   So you're woke.
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.180]   You're woke.
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.180]   Right?
[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:32.220]   The reason I'm using that term to refer to what Paul is saying because it does relate,
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:39.220]   because Paul says considering the time, considering the hour, considering the season that you
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.520]   and I are living in, he says let us wake up from our slumber.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:50.420]   And he describes in chapter 13, 12 to 14, what does it mean to be woke?
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:57.180]   A biblical definition, not the urban dictionary, but the ESV dictionary.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:03.100]   What does the Bible say about being awake?
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.060]   Just to go off the definition of what the urban dictionary says, to be able to see,
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:12.580]   to understand truth, that changes everything.
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.500]   Doesn't that describe every single Christian?
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.860]   I remember part of the reason why I enjoyed that movie Matrix so much is that when they
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:24.100]   offered the red pill, right?
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.260]   So if you don't know this movie, I can't help you, but if you remember this movie, they
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.660]   offer that red pill and they take the red pill, and as a result of taking the red pill,
[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.400]   a whole new world opens up.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:40.900]   It's the truth, but it wasn't a truth that was pleasant, and yet it was truth.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:46.740]   And we realize that everything that they knew about the world was fake, right?
[00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.180]   And it was pleasant.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.060]   If you just never saw it, if you never took the pill, you would have never known, and
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.140]   you would have just lived like everybody else, but because you took the pill and your eyes
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.820]   were open, you can never shut it.
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.460]   Because once you take it, you can't go back.
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:08.380]   Every Christian, when we come to Christ and the gospel opens our eyes, we can never go
[00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.940]   back unless you never believe it to begin with.
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.300]   If all you were really committed to was the religious life of being a Christian where
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:21.280]   you go to church and you do certain things and maybe God's going to bless you, so you're
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:26.360]   basically asking God to help you with life, help you with your business, help you with
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.440]   raising children.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.700]   If that's the reason why you came to church, then your eyes were never really open to begin
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.540]   with.
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.240]   But if you came and you were confronted with the gospel truth that the world that you and
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:43.060]   I are living in is under the condemnation of God, it's under God's judgment, and death
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.060]   reigns.
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:49.940]   And so the truth of the gospel opens our eyes to see that everything that you and I have
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:55.340]   been experiencing was under the reign of the God of this age.
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:14:03.580]   Music, culture, what we value, our sense of safety, our sense of security, all of that
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.700]   was a lie.
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.060]   What happens when we die?
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.280]   All of this that we were taught was wrong.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.820]   And so once our eyes get open, we're woke.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.760]   We get awakened.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.520]   And if you were truly awakened, you could never close that again unless you never really
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.660]   believed it to begin with.
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.420]   That's what happened to the disciples.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.580]   They were completely blind until Jesus goes to the cross.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.920]   Jesus is telling them he's going to die, resurrect.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.240]   And during that whole time, you could completely tell they don't get it.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:42.520]   Their idea of the kingdom just didn't fit what Jesus was doing until he was resurrected.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:46.440]   And all of a sudden, you could see the light bulbs going off.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.440]   I get it.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.440]   Now I get it.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.440]   Now I get it.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.120]   Now I see why Jesus was willing to go to the cross.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.220]   Now I see what he meant by picking up your cross.
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.800]   Now I see, he said, if he who finds his life will lose it.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.080]   He who loses his life for my sake, he will find it.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.680]   All these things that probably didn't make much sense to them, it all of a sudden began
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.800]   to make sense.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:12.400]   And once their eyes got open, they looked at their life differently.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:17.200]   Even in the book of Acts, as they're standing before the Sanhedrin, commanding them to not
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.960]   to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.960]   They said, you tell me if it's right or wrong to obey you or obey God.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.280]   And they defiantly continued to preach the gospel.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.640]   What gave them this kind of courage?
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.320]   Because their eyes got opened.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:37.600]   Apostle Paul, on the road to Damascus, he encounters this Christ that he thought, ultimately,
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.640]   that he was doing God's work.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:46.040]   And then God knocks him off a horse and he's in anti- what is it?
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.040]   My mind went blank.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.040]   Where was he at?
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.040]   Tell me.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.040]   Where was he going?
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.040]   Damascus.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.040]   Sorry.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.040]   Okay.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.040]   You guys all knew it, but you didn't want to say anything.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.040]   Okay.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:00.880]   He's on the road to Damascus.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.880]   He's there for three days, scale on his eyes.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:08.100]   So can you imagine what he was thinking for those three days?
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.740]   Everything he knew about God was wrong.
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.740]   Everything that he thought he was doing for God was wrong.
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:22.060]   So once the scale falls off and he's encountered God, he's a completely different person.
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.880]   He's born again.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.220]   Just like Jesus says to Nicodemus.
[00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.500]   He's a completely different person because he opened his eyes.
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.500]   What happened to Paul?
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.220]   Did he go through seminary?
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.560]   Was it like 15 years of intense training that he went through?
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.200]   That all of a sudden that he was willing to give his life?
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.200]   What happened to him?
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.080]   Like today we think like discipleship, if you just put them through the right training
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.840]   program, you have a guy who doesn't love God, all of a sudden he's going to love God.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:55.640]   But if you look at the scripture, people who are running full speed ahead one direction,
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:01.480]   all of a sudden change, and then they're giving their lives, they become generous, they're
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:08.940]   living with boldness, they have intimate fellowship, and all because God opened their eyes.
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.680]   That happens to every Christian.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.320]   It happens to every disciple.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.520]   It happens to Apostle Paul.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:20.520]   It happens to every single one of us when we genuinely encounter Christ.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:27.760]   So being sober is not necessarily about our circumstance.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.760]   It's about believing what we already profess to believe, really believing what we already
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.760]   profess to believe.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.640]   I want to point out three things that he says about being awake or woke.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:42.720]   Number one, being woke is being mindful of who we are.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.800]   Really remembering and our life being consistent with the things that we profess.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.800]   He says to wake up from our slumber.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.480]   And what does he mean by slumber?
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.760]   Slumber basically means not living according to what we profess.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:02.280]   In 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, 2-4, Paul describes what it will be like before he comes, before
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.800]   Jesus comes back, and this is how he describes it.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.160]   For you yourselves are fully aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:14.480]   the night, while people are saying there is peace and security.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.720]   That sudden destruction will come upon them in labor pains, come upon a pregnant woman,
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.600]   and they will not escape.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:26.560]   But you are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:35.000]   Paul describes the end times before Jesus comes back, that they're seeking for peace
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   and security.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   He's not talking about debauchery.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.680]   He's not talking about setting up idols and worshipping it.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:45.360]   And all of these things may be true, but predominantly, the way he describes it is, people are just
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:51.920]   going to be living their normal lives, which is what everybody seeks.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:52.920]   There is peace.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:57.240]   They're going to be seeking peace and security.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:01.280]   That's how he describes slumber, not being awake.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.320]   They're just living their lives like everybody else.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:09.000]   Again, in Matthew 24, 37, 39, Jesus himself describes the end times this way.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.400]   As were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:17.440]   For as in those days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.340]   in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark.
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:26.080]   And they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.000]   of the Son of Man.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Look what it describes.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.360]   What were they doing?
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:35.760]   They were just eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.200]   There's nothing that he describes here.
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.200]   It's like they were in debauchery.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.760]   They set up idols and they sacrificed everything.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.320]   They had human sacrifice.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:49.040]   No, he said they were just eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage, just
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.680]   like everybody else in this world does.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.720]   That's how the Bible describes being asleep.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:04.080]   See, it's understandable that if you do not believe the gospel truth, that we would
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.240]   live to make the most of this world.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:13.320]   So it would make sense that our goal is to have peace and security if this is it.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.440]   If this is everything that we have, if these 70, 80 years that we have on this earth, if
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.700]   this is it, you want to make the most of it.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:26.320]   But once our eyes become open to the gospel truth, that everything that you and I experience
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:32.800]   in this world is under condemnation of God, that when he comes, all of it is under God's
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.480]   judgment.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:39.600]   Everything that we experience is under the reign of death, and that ultimately, God is
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.640]   preparing us to go into eternity because of what Christ has done.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:48.520]   If we've opened our eyes to that truth and continue to live like the rest of the world,
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.000]   he says we are asleep.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.880]   You have forgotten who you are.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.400]   Either you have drifted away from the truth of the gospel, or you never believed it to
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.960]   begin with.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:05.040]   It's like somebody who wakes up in the middle of the night and sees his house burning down.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:10.960]   That truth, if you believe it, no matter how tired you are, no matter how fatigued you
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.920]   are, you will get out of bed.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.520]   You will grab your children and run out of the house.
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.400]   You're not going to sit there and say, "Well, I know the house is burning down.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:24.800]   I believe it with all my heart, but I'm going to give it another five minutes because I'm
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.880]   a bit tired today."
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.360]   Maybe five minutes later, maybe ten minutes later, you won't do that.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.120]   If you wake up in the middle of the night and you realize what is happening to your
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.600]   house, that truth is going to get you moving.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.320]   It's going to get you to be running out of the house.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:47.800]   So a Christian who has professed to believe this gospel and to live like the rest of the
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:52.920]   world, either he has drifted so far away from the thing that he professed that he has fallen
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:59.040]   asleep and has completely forgot who he is, or he never believed it to begin with.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:07.040]   But somebody who has opened his eyes to this truth can't one day just decide to not see.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.400]   It's no different than an individual who sees the fire and just goes back to sleep.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.960]   It is not possible.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:19.720]   So the first thing that he calls us is to get up from our slumber.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.440]   You don't have to be a super Christian.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.720]   You don't have to go to ten years of discipleship training.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:30.160]   You don't have to have an MDiv degree to know this.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.840]   This is the reality of the truth from day one.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.760]   You meet Christ.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.640]   You don't need to be a dispensationalist.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.480]   You don't need to be covenant theology.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.740]   You don't need to know all the intricate details of the Trinity.
[00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:49.120]   The fact that you have confessed to believe that Jesus was crucified and was resurrected
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:56.600]   from the dead, that that truth from day one opens our eyes and we are changed.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.920]   So the first thing that he calls us to is to wake up.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.240]   Wake up from our slumber.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:11.000]   In Ezekiel, God says that he has established us as watchmen.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.520]   And if our job is to be watchmen, the worst thing that a watchman can do is to fall asleep.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.520]   Because his job is to warn the people that danger is coming.
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.520]   And so he says to the watchman, "I tell you that danger is coming.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.600]   I say to you, unrighteous man, that if he doesn't repent, judgment is coming, and you
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.920]   fall asleep and you don't tell him, not only will he be judged, but so will you for not
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.920]   warning him."
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.720]   But he says, "I tell you to tell a wicked man to turn from his sin, and you tell him
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:44.640]   and he doesn't turn from his sin, he will be judged, but you have done your job."
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.560]   God says that he purchased us for the purpose of declaring his glory.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:53.240]   Our very identity is to be the light of this world.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:24:00.160]   He says you are salt for the purpose of preservation, and yet if the salt loses its flavor, what
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.360]   good is it?
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:06.120]   If a watchman is standing as a watchman to warn the people and you fall asleep, what
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.980]   good is it?
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:12.440]   The whole purpose of why you and I exist, he says, while we're here, while we're not
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:16.920]   in heaven, the moment that we meet Christ, while we're not in heaven, is so that we can
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:25.080]   be the mediator to warn the church, to warn the world that Christ is coming to prepare.
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:30.440]   That's why the first thing about being awake, being woke, is to recognize who we are, that
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:37.520]   we don't live like the rest of the world, that we don't follow what the world goes after.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.500]   We look at people who win the lottery and we say, "Wow."
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:41.500]   We look at that with envy.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:46.940]   We look at guys who are getting drafted in the NBA and like, "Oh, I wish."
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:52.420]   We look at guys who started great business and they have multiple businesses all over
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.420]   the world.
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.140]   We look at people who have great houses and driving around with nice cars, and we look
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:04.680]   with them with envy and we covet, because we have forgotten who they are.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.820]   We have forgotten who we are.
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:12.300]   We are children of the Most High God.
[00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:18.380]   The blood of Christ has covered us, and our destiny is eternity in heaven.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:24.180]   So for us to look at the world and the trivial things, even at their greatest success, to
[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:31.260]   covet that, is to forget who we are, is to forget what we have been given in Christ.
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:36.940]   That's why in Ephesians 4, 1-3, Paul says, "I therefore, prisoner for the Lord, urge
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:41.860]   you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called."
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:47.460]   You and I have been called as children of the Most High God.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.420]   If we're not careful, we can pursue trivial things in this world, just like the rest of
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:57.460]   the world, seeking peace and comfort and wealth, and at the end, all of that is going to be
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.540]   under the judgment of God.
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:06.940]   So the first thing about being awake is to know who we are, to remember who we are, remember
[00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:11.660]   the height from which we have fallen, to repent and redo the things that we did at first.
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:16.500]   Philippians 1-27, "Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:21.400]   that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you, that you are standing firm
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.500]   in one spirit with one mind, striving side by side for the faith of the gospel."
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:29.060]   To live a manner worthy of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.540]   And obviously, he's not saying you have to earn your salvation.
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.940]   Obviously, that's not what he's saying.
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:38.620]   He said, "Consider what you have been given."
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.860]   Consider what you have been given.
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:48.860]   The fact that you're able to come to church and worship God, do you realize what a tremendous
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:51.220]   gift that is?
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:58.140]   Because if the condemnation of man came because we have fallen short of the glory of God,
[00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.580]   because mankind had rebelled and they are living their life for their own glory, living
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:05.580]   their life for their own satisfaction, and then to be able to have access to this God
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:09.380]   to come back and worship is to restore what was lost in creation.
[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:15.220]   So the fact that you and I can come, listen to his word, pray songs, fellowship together
[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:21.220]   with other Christians, the tremendous gift, sacrifice that went to, to bring us to this
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.620]   point.
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:27.060]   To call God our Abba Father.
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:35.580]   You know, we complain so much about fellowship, about other people and how, what they have
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.060]   or don't have.
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:44.300]   And we don't proclaim enough about the gift of fellowship we have with God.
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:50.180]   It doesn't make sense to spend all our time discouraged by people when the greatest thing
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:54.380]   that we have in God never comes out of our mouth.
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.460]   It just doesn't make sense.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:01.420]   That's just like winning the lottery and complaining about a parking ticket.
[00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:04.660]   We have access to God.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:11.260]   Everything that we have for life of godliness has been given to us in Jesus Christ.
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:18.980]   So it doesn't make sense for us to celebrate the gift of life and the Son of God and complain
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:24.180]   about how the road is crooked to get there.
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:28.900]   If we have forgotten what we have, that's the first thing that he calls us to, to wake
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.700]   up from our slumber, remember who we are.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:36.420]   Secondly, he says, to be woke means to put off the works of darkness.
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.260]   Live consistently with who you are.
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:43.740]   If we know who we are, and if we believe the things that we profess, then put off the things
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.340]   that is inconsistent with the things that we profess.
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:51.180]   He says, let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:55.500]   Let us walk properly as in the daytime.
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.940]   And then he describes some of these things.
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:01.780]   Obviously there's a long list of things that he could easily put in saying that you should
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.240]   shun these things.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:08.780]   But almost always on the top of this list is sexual immorality.
[00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:12.460]   Not in orgies, drunkenness, not in sexual immorality, not in sensuality.
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:16.820]   And the scripture says to flee from sexual immorality.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.420]   It's almost always on the top of the list.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:23.660]   The number one on the sins to flee is sexual immorality.
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:24.660]   You ever think about why?
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.820]   I mean, you talk about murder.
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.860]   You could think about stealing, slander.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:34.220]   I mean, all of these things hurt other people.
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:39.820]   And I can, I can understand why the world pushes the envelope with sexuality.
[00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:46.680]   Because if the worst thing that you can do is to hurt other people, sexuality, like who
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.740]   you have sex with, why you have sex with them, as long as the two consensual adults don't
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:56.520]   mind, why is this such a big deal?
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:01.180]   If I wasn't a Christian, I completely understand where their mindset is coming from.
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:06.740]   Who are you when two consensual adults, whether it's man or man, woman or woman, or it's sex
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:12.380]   outside of marriage, who cares if they're okay with it?
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:16.160]   Why is sexuality so offensive to God?
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:21.060]   Why is this on the top of the list when it really, I mean, consider the damage it does
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:25.780]   for murder, for hatred, for slander, for stealing, and then sexuality to people who are just
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:33.040]   having fun and they enjoy it and no one is hurt by that, so what do you care about it?
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.720]   Consider what sex is.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:42.940]   Sex is at the core, human sexuality is at the core of God's purpose in creation.
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:49.660]   God created Adam and Eve and he gave the command to be fruitful and multiply, so our very existence
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:55.680]   as man and woman centers around sexuality.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.860]   God ordained sex to procreate other human beings.
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.940]   Every single one of us is a result of somebody having sex.
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:07.260]   I know you're going to be grossed out thinking about it, but that's, you're adults here,
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:08.260]   right?
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:12.940]   Every single one of us are here because of sexual encounter between husband and wife,
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:18.100]   and God ordained this from the beginning, that the union between husband and wife was
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:24.680]   ordained to procreate other human beings.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:29.980]   Every other relationship in creation stemmed from the relationship between husband and
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.500]   wife.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.500]   Children came from husband and wife.
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:39.660]   God didn't create grandparents and grandfather and grandmother, aunts and uncles, God created
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:44.820]   husband and wife, and from that came children, and from that came grandchildren, from that
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:50.500]   came aunts and uncles, so all other relationships stem from the relationship between husband
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.500]   and wife.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:55.620]   And it all came because of the sexual relationship between husband and wife.
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:02.580]   So if God ordained that for the purpose of creation to bring glory to him and mankind
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:07.700]   fell because they disobeyed God and ate of the fruit that God told them not to because
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:13.660]   of this tree of knowledge of good and evil, how much more would it be offensive if it's
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:20.100]   at the core of our existence what God has ordained we pervert?
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:26.620]   If the marriage bed is perverted, it overflows to their children.
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:32.180]   It overflows eventually and affects every other relationship.
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:38.300]   It's not simply about whether it bothers you or whether people are bothered or not bothered.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.860]   At the core of God's purpose of creation was sexuality.
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:47.140]   So the perversion of what God intended is an offense to God.
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:51.900]   And that's why it says in 1 Peter 2.11, "Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:58.420]   from passions of the flesh which wage war against your soul."
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:02.980]   It is not just me, it doesn't bother me or maybe it just only affects me.
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:06.540]   He says no, it is waging war against your soul.
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.860]   We only look at it at the physical.
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.660]   But the spiritual, there's war.
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:20.200]   He goes on and he says not only does that, he says to flee from quarreling and jealousy.
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.220]   The scripture says before you go to the altar, if somebody has something against you, deal
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.740]   with that before you come.
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:32.540]   Come to the Lord and say, "Forgive me as I have forgiven my brothers," to be reconciled.
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:37.820]   And again in James chapter 4, 1-3, "What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you?
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:43.780]   Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you?"
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:50.580]   There's something internal going on and there's some frustration, certain desires that I have
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:57.380]   and it is not met and when that becomes expressed, it becomes a conflict and he says, "Isn't
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.860]   that the core?
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.020]   Because there is a war within you.
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:05.180]   You desire and you do not have, so you murder, you coven, you cannot obtain, so you fight
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.180]   and you quarrel.
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.420]   You do not have because you do not ask.
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:13.860]   And you ask and you do not receive because you ask wrongly to spend it on your own passions."
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:22.580]   See, he's saying that these things are inconsistent with somebody whose eyes have become open.
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:27.740]   To acknowledge God as our Lord and Savior is to acknowledge God's intent in our life
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:30.420]   as supreme.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.780]   You can't simply confess and say, "You know, I've opened my eyes and I've seen the truth
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:35.900]   and this is not about discipleship.
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:39.820]   God did tell us to teach them to observe all that I have commanded you."
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:45.100]   He's simply saying, "Do you believe this truth or not?
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:49.300]   Do you actually believe the gospel that we profess or not?
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.700]   Have you actually seen Christ or not?
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:55.100]   Do you love him or not?
[00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.700]   Are you eagerly waiting for Jesus or not?
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:02.100]   Are you a follower of Jesus or not?"
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.680]   There is in six different categories.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:09.140]   Either you've opened your eyes and you confess this truth and that changed your outlook on
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:13.340]   everything in life or you didn't.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:16.040]   There isn't anything in between.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:24.020]   It doesn't require years of discipleship to make a commitment and to say, "I believe."
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.260]   That's what he's calling us to.
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:29.980]   He said, "If you know who you are, live according to what you profess.
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.700]   Put off the thieves of the darkness."
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:38.420]   And then he says, thirdly, "To put on the armor of light and to put on the Lord Jesus
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:39.420]   Christ."
[00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.420]   To put him on.
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.780]   In Isaiah 61, it says, "I will greatly rejoice in the Lord.
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:47.060]   My soul shall exalt in my God, for he has clothed me with garments of salvation.
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:52.100]   He has covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decks himself like a priest
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:57.020]   with a beautiful headdress and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels."
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:01.620]   As you and I have been studying through the book of Leviticus, in Leviticus it makes it
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:05.900]   very clear when the priests were to give sacrifices or take something out of the camp, they had
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:08.340]   to put on the priestly garment.
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:13.340]   And the priestly garment separated them from common and holy.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:16.940]   And so what it meant was to put on the garment means that they are different from the other
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:21.700]   people who are coming into the tabernacle because they are preparing for worship.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.740]   They're doing something sacred.
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:28.620]   So a Jew, when they heard the idea of putting off and putting on, automatically had this
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:31.760]   image of becoming a priest for God's kingdom.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.740]   And that's exactly what he's telling us to do.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.300]   To put on the armor.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:38.140]   And this is not just any clothing.
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:41.640]   You don't put on army to go shopping.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.640]   You don't put on the army to take a nap.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:48.980]   You put on the armor because you're preparing for some kind of battle.
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:52.420]   And that's exactly what he is calling us to do.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.980]   To engage in spiritual warfare.
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.700]   That's why Paul says in 2 Timothy 4, 7, "I have fought the good fight.
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:00.700]   I have finished the race.
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.620]   I have kept the faith."
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:07.280]   This is Paul at the end of his life describing the totality of his life after he met Christ.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.980]   He called it a fight.
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:16.740]   Think about how hard we work because we don't want to fight.
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:20.660]   Think about how we automatically have a knee-jerk reaction to anything that's going to cause
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.680]   discomfort in my life.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.860]   Maybe sometimes we don't even want to hear sermons that's going to poke at things that
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:29.140]   you don't want to hear.
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:33.340]   You kind of turn your ear or turn your face because you don't want to hear the truth because
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:40.060]   that means, the truth means, it's going to challenge the things that you hold on to dearly.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:45.140]   But if you profess to be a believer of the gospel of Jesus Christ and you have committed
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:50.780]   to live consistently with what you believe, he says, put on the armor.
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.980]   And put Christ on.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.280]   And what does it mean to put Christ on?
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.780]   To put Christ on means to put who he is.
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:02.700]   That everything that we have is basically to portray Christ.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.700]   We are the body of Christ.
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.140]   We are the arms of Christ.
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.260]   We are the mouth of Christ.
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:12.740]   So we are called to do what he would do if he was in this situation.
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:17.340]   And finally he says, to make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desire, to live
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:21.900]   in such a way where you're not living by the flesh but living by the spirit.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:26.900]   Martin Luther said, "I cannot keep sparrows from flying about my head, but I can keep
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:32.020]   them from making a nest in my hair."
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:35.100]   We can't help being tempted.
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:38.340]   We can't help sometimes being frustrated.
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:44.460]   We can't help at times wanting security and safety.
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:51.900]   But when you embrace that, when you entertain that, when you make that your goal in life,
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:58.500]   you have to take a step back and ask yourself, do I believe this gospel?
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:02.980]   Do I believe that the world is on fire or not?
[00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:07.980]   Do I believe that Christ is coming with righteous judgment or not?
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:12.180]   When I read the book of Revelation, is that true or not?
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:17.700]   When I read the book of Romans, that Christ came to save sinners and as a result of this
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:22.940]   mercy and grace, the challenge to live a life worthy of the gospel, to give our lives as
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:26.420]   a living sacrifice, do I believe this or not?
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.900]   There is nothing in between.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:37.580]   Either our eyes are open and we can never go back to our old life or we can live a lie,
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:43.740]   all our lives, thinking that we have some sort of fire insurance and then coming to
[00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:50.220]   meet the Lord saying, "Not everyone who calls me Lord, Lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven."
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.540]   Either we are awake or not.
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.700]   That's why Paul says in Philippians 3, 13, "Brothers, I do not consider that I have made
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:01.860]   it my own, but one thing I do, forgetting what is behind and straining toward what lies
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:06.980]   ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:07.980]   Jesus."
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:13.100]   Let those of us who are mature think this way and if anything you think otherwise, God
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.060]   will reveal that also to you.
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:19.100]   Only let us hold true to what we have already attained.
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:24.900]   Hold true, be honest with what you profess, be honest with what you sing, be honest with
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:30.140]   the passages that you read, be honest with the sermons that you hear, have integrity,
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:35.260]   be true to yourself, be true to the things that you confess.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.260]   Don't say you believe in heaven and hell.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:42.740]   Don't say that Jesus died for your sins and that heaven is waiting for us and then live
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:48.180]   completely contradicting everything that we profess every Sunday.
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.260]   Who are we?
[00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.260]   What are we to put off?
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.780]   What are we to put on?
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:56.140]   And let me conclude with this.
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:01.300]   You know, with all the stuff happening in North Korea and South Korea, because I am
[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:06.660]   a Korean fob, people ask me, "Give me your expert political advice on how to think of
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.660]   these things."
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:10.500]   Right?
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:17.060]   I really don't know what to think of it because just a few months ago and years ago, we were
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:22.180]   hearing news about how Kim Jong-un, the dictator of North Korea, was killing his own brother,
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:25.300]   his uncle, his close companions.
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:29.180]   And prior to that, in the previous regime, for the last 30, 40, 50 years, they were killing
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:35.740]   their own people, propping up a communist army, and the eight billions of money, dollar
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:41.460]   that went into North Korea was used to prop up their regime and to make nuclear bombs.
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.020]   This was, this is a fact.
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:46.060]   This is not a political opinion.
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:50.660]   Recently, they've been threatening, you know, nuclear bomb, nuclear attack, and so everybody
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:54.140]   was kind of on the edge, and now they seem like they're going to have a peace accord
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.540]   and they're shaking hands.
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:42:00.860]   And historically, it's crazy that the North Korean dictator actually crossed over to South
[00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:05.260]   Korea and the South Korean president actually crossed over to North Korea, and then soon
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:09.220]   Donald Trump is going to meet them at the same place where they did that, and the world
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:14.780]   is celebrating that we're at peace.
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:18.180]   What does it mean to make peace with somebody who's killing their own people?
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:22.940]   Again, you know, I don't get into politics here, you know, because there's, I know there's
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:29.340]   all kinds of opinions, but what does it mean to shake hands with somebody who previously
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:34.820]   used all the aid that you've given them for the poor and use it to build a nuclear bomb?
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:40.700]   Now I'm optimistic and I'm praying that it will lead to something good, but I don't know
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:43.220]   what to think of it.
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:47.700]   I don't know what to think of it because the whole purpose of this is like, we'll give
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:51.780]   you money, just don't go crazy.
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:56.980]   So you can continue to do what you're doing, you can continue to let your people suffer,
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:03.460]   you can continue to kill anybody who opposes you, but just don't have a nuclear bomb.
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.820]   As long as we're safe.
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:10.680]   So making peace with North Korea, I don't know what to make of it.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:15.800]   What does it mean for Christians to make peace in this world?
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:20.000]   The scripture says the God of this age is Satan.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.840]   He has blinded the mind of the unbelievers so they do not see the gospel and the glory
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.720]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:29.760]   What does it mean to make peace in a world that is under condemnation?
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.960]   I don't know what to make of it.
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:38.840]   I don't know what to make of Christians who profess to believe this and live and decide
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:46.880]   and everything that they do is to live a peaceful and quiet life on this earth.
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.000]   I don't know what to make of that.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.840]   What does it mean for Christians to live peacefully here, knowing that judgment is coming?
[00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:59.400]   I want to encourage and challenge you.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.880]   The scripture says broad is the path that leads to destruction and many will be found
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:10.040]   on it, but narrow is the way to eternal life and few will be found on it.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:14.760]   Don't forfeit your passion because you see a few.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.960]   It will always take a few.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:25.720]   We always seek safety and comfort in numbers, but there's great danger in crowds.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:28.000]   Remember the large crowds?
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.400]   They're the ones who abandoned Jesus.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:34.160]   It was the large crowds who crucified Jesus.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:39.000]   It was the large crowds who persecuted the few Christians.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:47.200]   Revival never came with a movement of the crowds, but when God empowered the few.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:55.200]   Don't wait for urgency to happen with the crowd for you to commit your life to Christ.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.480]   The crowds only come when they see other crowds coming.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:04.840]   The remnant move wherever and whenever God moves.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.520]   I want to encourage you.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.080]   Don't wait for a movement.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.720]   Don't wait for other people to wake up.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:14.720]   Don't wait for other people to join you.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:18.120]   God always calls the remnant.
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:24.440]   If he opened your eyes and you believe the truth, live up to the calling that God has
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.440]   given.
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.160]   Let's pray.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.920]   (pages rustling)
