[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.580]   - All right, good evening, everybody.
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.580]   Well, we're gonna go right into our discussion time.
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:53.580]   Just as a reminder to ask really good questions
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.580]   about the text and then just share your observations
[00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.580]   and your findings.
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.580]   Last week, I announced that each week,
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.580]   I am going to put up my phone number
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.580]   and invite you guys to ask any questions
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.580]   or if your team or table group gets stuck on a topic,
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.580]   I'm gonna put up my phone number.
[00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.580]   If you have any questions or if your team or table group
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.580]   gets stuck on a certain question
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.580]   or you have some theological questions
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.580]   associated with the text, you can send that over
[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.580]   and we'll have a time at the review to cover it, okay?
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.580]   So go ahead and go into your discussion
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.580]   and at 8 o'clock, we'll be back.
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.580]   Thanks.

[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:26.580]   Okay, good, it looks like everybody is out.
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:30.580]   Let me take a moment to pray so that we can go before the Lord
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:33.580]   asking His blessing as we cover the passage.
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:35.580]   Let's pray together.
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:39.580]   Our God, we are so thankful for Your Word.
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:44.580]   We recognize, God, that before You reveal Your truth to us,
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:47.580]   before, God, You enlighten us,
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:50.580]   before You grant to us faith in Christ,
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:53.580]   we are in such darkness.
[01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:57.580]   And we recognize, God, that Your Word is washing us,
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:00.580]   and so we pray that every Bible study that we have
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:03.580]   and every interaction with the Scripture,
[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:05.580]   it would be thoroughly sanctifying,
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:08.580]   and, God, that it would be nourishing our soul.
[01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:14.580]   We pray that our hearts would be so receptive to Your correction,
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:19.580]   and no matter how severe or even over the top it may feel to us,
[01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:21.580]   that, God, we will receive with humility.
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:24.580]   We thank You in Christ's name. Amen.
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:29.580]   Okay, great, so come on in, everybody.
[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:35.580]   It's always good to do a little bit of a review, okay?
[01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:41.580]   And so if you recall, chapter 4, verses 1 through 7, our last week,
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:44.580]   essentially, He was trying to show to us,
[01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:47.580]   "Listen, this is the gospel that you believed.
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:51.580]   This is your before and after, the great conversion."
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:54.580]   And just by way of a little table here,
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:08:00.580]   before Christ, He was trying to reiterate and impress this thought,
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:02.580]   "You're like a slave child.
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:04.580]   You have such limitations over you.
[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:07.580]   You have no rights, you have no claims, you have no resources,
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:10.580]   and you're underneath a heavy hand, right?
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:15.580]   You're in bondage, and you're under the elemental things of the world."
[01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:19.580]   And even if religious leaders, political leaders,
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:21.580]   whoever it is, has systems for you,
[01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:25.580]   last week I gave the analogy, all it is is child's play.
[01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:28.580]   It's like a bunch of kids making rules, playing make-believe.
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:31.580]   None of it is worth anything.
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:37.580]   And then the emphatic, just great privilege we have in the gospel is,
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:44.580]   but instead, at that fullness of time, we have adoptions of sons.
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:48.580]   We have this great, great grace of God by which we are heirs,
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:51.580]   heirs to the promise, right?
[01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:54.580]   And so last week was showing us this contrast,
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:59.580]   and it leads up to this week's massively just like heavy question of--
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:01.580]   and I use the term "frustration"--
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:05.580]   how in the world can you go back then?
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:09.580]   You have an adoption by the king of the universe,
[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.580]   and one of the things I was reflecting on this week
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:14.580]   was trying to meditate on that adoption.
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:18.580]   And one thought that crossed my mind after the teaching was,
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:20.580]   "Man, it's crazy to think.
[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:25.580]   In our generation, adoption typically happens when--
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:28.580]   or fortunate situation where there is a child who,
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:32.580]   whatever the situation, the parents are not capable of taking care of,
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:34.580]   but most often it's a child.
[01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:36.580]   But imagine a grown adult.
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:40.580]   Imagine like a 35-year-old coming to you and asking you,
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:42.580]   "Can I be your son?"
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:44.580]   It just wouldn't make sense, right?
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:48.580]   Number one, it's incredibly inappropriate to ask that question.
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:50.580]   Number two, you would automatically assume,
[01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:52.580]   "Are you after my money?"
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:54.580]   That would be the question, right?
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:57.580]   But then to think that it is in God's kind intention
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:00.580]   to give us his inheritance,
[01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:02.580]   it's crazy to think about.
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:05.580]   And so in thinking about it, what you have in the gospel,
[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:07.580]   he's asking that question,
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:09.580]   "How in the world do you go back?"
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:13.580]   And then so this week, he's going to be asking that question
[01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:19.580]   with a review of another layer of what it is that we have in the gospel.
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:22.580]   So by way of just quick overview,
[01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:25.580]   I separated it, verse 8 through 11,
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:30.580]   as the first half of today's paragraph.
[01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:33.580]   Thinking through, knowing God now,
[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:35.580]   are you going back to slavery?
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:38.580]   And then part two, starting from verse 11 and forward,
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.580]   and the reason why I say that is because
[01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:43.580]   that section starting from verse 11 down,
[01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:46.580]   he gets personal all the way down to verse 20,
[01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:50.580]   but it's a very heartfelt, personal plea saying,
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:54.580]   "I'm begging you, don't go down this route, right?
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:57.580]   "Be faithful to the Lord as I am."
[01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:59.580]   So as we think about that,
[01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:05.580]   let's jump right in to the first half of our paragraph for tonight.
[01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:11.580]   And you can see immediately just the contrast of the gospel
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:16.580]   encapsulated into this idea of, just like last time,
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:19.580]   before conversion, before Christ, this was you, right?
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:20.580]   At that time.
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:23.580]   So these words give you those indications,
[01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:26.580]   but now that this is showing you this contrast
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:28.580]   and we need to appreciate that, right?
[01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:31.580]   And then this is the big, big push,
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:33.580]   emphatically asking the question,
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:35.580]   "Then how is it that you turn back?"
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:37.580]   And we're going to take some time meditating on it.
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:42.580]   Taking it a little bit more precise or specific to verse 8,
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:45.580]   if he is trying to help us focus in
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:48.580]   or have us concentrate and think about
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:52.580]   our lives former or prior to Christ, right?
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:54.580]   What is it in terms of our former life
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:57.580]   that he wants us to think about that's different from last time?
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.580]   Is he just doing a second run
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:02.580]   so that he gives you a one-two punch in the face?
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:05.580]   Or is there something more specific he wants us to think about?
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:07.580]   And if you'll notice, there are two things.
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:12.580]   One is this idea, okay, that you did not know God.
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:17.580]   And then two is a reiteration of the idea that you were slaves, okay?
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:22.580]   So you have two thoughts there.
[01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:26.580]   And I do think that one of the questions that came in--
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:28.580]   thanks for sending it in earlier--
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:30.580]   is one of the questions was here,
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:33.580]   when it gives you this contrast about knowing God,
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:35.580]   are they using the same words or is it different?
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:37.580]   And they are different.
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:40.580]   Meaning, the very first thing he tells us here is that
[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:42.580]   before Christ, you did not know God,
[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:44.580]   and the word used is "oida."
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.580]   And then later in verse 9 when he says,
[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:48.580]   "Now you do know him," right?
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:50.580]   And he uses the word "gnosko,"
[01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:55.580]   showing you the vastness of that contrast.
[01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:57.580]   Another way to put it is,
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:59.580]   prior to Christ opening your eyes,
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:01.580]   prior to the Spirit working in your life,
[01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:04.580]   you're not even able to perceive him.
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:06.580]   You're not even able to recognize him.
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:09.580]   The word "oida" has the idea of knowing a fact.
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:13.580]   The word "oida" has the idea of being able to perceive something.
[01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:15.580]   "Oh, I recognize that. I observe."
[01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:17.580]   "Gnosko" is actually knowing something,
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:20.580]   either by way of experience, knowing something completely,
[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:24.580]   or you're in the full process of knowing something.
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:26.580]   So in that sense, it's like saying,
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:28.580]   "Before, you didn't even recognize him."
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:31.580]   That would be one way of putting that.
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:34.580]   And so, as we think about that,
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:37.580]   I want us to kind of have a moment
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:40.580]   just immediately of self-evaluation.
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:43.580]   Because what we see is
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:46.580]   Apostle Paul and the Scriptures,
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:48.580]   the Word trying to show us,
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:50.580]   maybe in the people's mind,
[01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:51.580]   they may be thinking,
[01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:54.580]   "Well, all I was doing was, in the life of the Church,
[01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:56.580]   "we were being taught this thing
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:14:01.580]   "about rituals and days and circumcision and whatnot."
[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:03.580]   But the way that Apostle Paul is talking is saying,
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:05.580]   "No, no, no, you don't understand.
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:09.580]   "By going to that, you're acting like you don't even know him."
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:12.580]   And so, here's a quick evaluation question.
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:15.580]   It's like--you know, I'll put it this way.
[01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:18.580]   There's a question for you.
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:22.580]   In the ways that we talk, in the ways that we act,
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:25.580]   are there ways that we behave
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:28.580]   that signify that we're talking like somebody
[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:31.580]   who doesn't know God?
[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:33.580]   What I mean is, you have a situation
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:36.580]   with a bunch of people who are converts within the Church.
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:40.580]   They're now, all of a sudden, following somebody else's teaching.
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:42.580]   And Apostle Paul is pointing at that.
[01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:44.580]   It's like, "Dude, you're going back to that time
[01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.580]   "when you had no idea who God was.
[01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:48.580]   "You didn't even recognize him."
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:52.580]   Is there anything in our lives that's kind of like that?
[01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:56.580]   Well, I would like to bring up one case scenario
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.580]   that I was kind of meditating on and thinking about
[01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:00.580]   as a way of quick evaluation.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:02.580]   And it comes down to the question of,
[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:04.580]   there are specific moments and instances
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:06.580]   in which we are tested,
[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:10.580]   and we are, like, duped and deceived by our enemy.
[01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:12.580]   And the specific instances are typically
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:15.580]   in moments when we suffer.
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:18.580]   When I look at the way that mainstream Christianity
[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:22.580]   handles suffering, I ask this question.
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:25.580]   Why are we suffering like we don't know God?
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:28.580]   Some of the main, just, voices,
[01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:32.580]   some of the main, just, mantras, taglines,
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:35.580]   and things commonly said amongst those who suffer,
[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:38.580]   those who feel like they're being put down or oppressed,
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:41.580]   are things like, "I am man, hear me roar.
[01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:43.580]   "No one's gonna put me down."
[01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:44.580]   Right?
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:46.580]   People talking like, "You know what?
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:48.580]   "I'm not gonna allow any of these negative forces
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:49.580]   "to be around me.
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:51.580]   "I'm gonna remove anything that feels
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:52.580]   "like it's oppressing me.
[01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:54.580]   "I am woman, hear me roar."
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:56.580]   I've even heard people say things like,
[01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:57.580]   "You know what?
[01:15:57.580 --> 01:15:59.580]   "I've been through this, and I've been through that.
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:02.580]   "Ask me, ask me about my suffering."
[01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:04.580]   My first response to that was,
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:08.580]   "Why are we talking like we don't have Jesus?
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:10.580]   "Why are we talking like we don't have the Holy Spirit
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:12.580]   "who's our great comforter and counselor,
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:15.580]   "someone who is with us and walking with us?
[01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:17.580]   "Why do we talk like that?"
[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:21.580]   Or, on the flip side, in the midst of suffering,
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:25.580]   if we're not trying to fight so that we can survive,
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:29.580]   people are saying, "Dude, my life is over.
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:32.580]   "Why do we say things like that?
[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:35.580]   "Why do we act like we have nothing else to live for?
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:36.580]   "Really?
[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:38.580]   "Our life is done?"
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:40.580]   In those ways, that's what I mean.
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:43.580]   It's like if we turn back and talk like the world,
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:46.580]   we talk like we don't know God, right?
[01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:49.580]   Okay, so in this contrast,
[01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.580]   I wanted to just highlight the fact
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:55.580]   that there is an emphasis in the previous.
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:58.580]   He was talking about how we were like slave-like children.
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:00.580]   You had no rights, no privileges, no inheritance,
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:02.580]   but now you have adoption.
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:04.580]   In this, in the second run of the gospel, essentially,
[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:07.580]   he's saying before you did not know God,
[01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:09.580]   but now you do.
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:11.580]   You know him.
[01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:15.580]   And so here we have the turn, right?
[01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:17.580]   The contrast in the gospel where he says,
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:19.580]   "You know God," and then he says,
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:21.580]   "Rather, you are known by God."
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:23.580]   And so he asked that emphatic question,
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:25.580]   how then do you try and go back?
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:27.580]   You know him, okay?
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:29.580]   You know him.
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:31.580]   We have to ask this question,
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:35.580]   what is the difference here between you knowing God
[01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:40.580]   versus you being known by God, right?
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:42.580]   Is this just him kind of giving a sequence where he says,
[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:44.580]   "You know, what happened in the gospel
[01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:47.580]   "was that you pursued the Lord
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.580]   "and you wanted to find who he was,
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:52.580]   "and then he came and met you and said, 'Ta-da, here I am.
[01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:54.580]   "'You found me.'" Right?
[01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:56.580]   How is he describing this?
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:59.580]   And I hope you got an opportunity to discuss it
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:02.580]   within your groups, okay?
[01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:06.580]   Here, I want to highlight to you a couple passages.
[01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:10.580]   This is a common theme within the scriptures
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:12.580]   that you guys know to be true.
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:14.580]   There is a sense in which we can look at things
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:18.580]   from our angle, okay, from the human angle.
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:22.580]   And from our angle, I have to pursue the Lord.
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:25.580]   I have to decide to receive.
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:27.580]   I have to decide to follow.
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:29.580]   That is true.
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.580]   But scripture says there is this theme, no, no, no.
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:35.580]   You exercise faith, you love because he loved first.
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:37.580]   Jesus straight up tells you,
[01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:39.580]   "You did not choose me, but I chose you."
[01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:42.580]   So does the scripture talk about our decision?
[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:44.580]   The answer is yes.
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:47.580]   A passage that I don't have on here is John 1, verse 12.
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:50.580]   "To all who received him, to those who believed in his name,
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:53.580]   "he gave the right to become children of God."
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:57.580]   Which means, yes, for you, when you hear the word,
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.580]   the way that you experience it is,
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:01.580]   "Today I must make this decision."
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:05.580]   But scripture is telling you nobody can come,
[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:07.580]   nobody can make that decision,
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:10.580]   nobody would ever be inclined, right?
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:13.580]   No human in their fleshly mind would even be inclined
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:16.580]   to make that choice unless the Father drew him
[01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:19.580]   and gave him that faith, okay?
[01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:22.580]   Why is that important?
[01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:25.580]   Why does that matter to this discussion?
[01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:29.580]   Because true faith has with it this question,
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:31.580]   how does God work?
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:33.580]   And basically what Apostle Paul is saying is,
[01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:36.580]   you know how God works.
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:40.580]   You know the way that he has accomplished redemption.
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:43.580]   If you've ever just walked through the Old Testament,
[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:46.580]   you know nobody touches his glory.
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:49.580]   Nobody takes credit for the deliverance.
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:52.580]   Nobody takes credit for his masterful might
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:54.580]   that he exercised in Egypt.
[01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:56.580]   Nobody takes credit for what he did in deliverance
[01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:59.580]   from the Philistines, from any nation, any tribe.
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:02.580]   God alone deserves glory, amen?
[01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:06.580]   When we receive grace, it's to us his love,
[01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:09.580]   but when we receive grace, it's to him his glory.
[01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:11.580]   You don't touch it.
[01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:13.580]   How in the world?
[01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.580]   And you know him.
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:17.580]   You've seen how he works.
[01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:19.580]   How in the world do you go back then,
[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:21.580]   acting like you don't know?
[01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:23.580]   That's the question, okay?
[01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:30.580]   Now, because the emphatic question is asked right here,
[01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:33.580]   right, like how?
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:37.580]   We can take it like just a, you know,
[01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:39.580]   what they call a hypothetical rhetorical question
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:41.580]   that's not supposed to be answered.
[01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:43.580]   It's just supposed to emphatically tell you
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:45.580]   you're just being ridiculous, right?
[01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:48.580]   But actually, it's important for us to ask
[01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:51.580]   and then sit there and meditate, right?
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.580]   Don't pass that by.
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:56.580]   I'm gonna make this a discussion question for you guys
[01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:59.580]   in application to ask and then to answer
[01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:04.580]   why is it that Christians who can actually experience
[01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:06.580]   a lot of fruit in their lives,
[01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:10.580]   later we're gonna notice the Christians in this area,
[01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:12.580]   did they exhibit some fruit?
[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:13.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:16.580]   At the tail end of this paragraph that we're looking at,
[01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:18.580]   Apostle Paul commends them saying,
[01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:20.580]   "You did all that for me.
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:21.580]   "You received me.
[01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:22.580]   "You received the message.
[01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:24.580]   "You took care of me," all that stuff, right?
[01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:26.580]   And what's more, Acts chapter 4,
[01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:28.580]   actually, I think it's Acts chapter 12,
[01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:30.580]   but when Apostle Paul is there in Galatia,
[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:35.580]   it talks about how they were just imploring the disciples,
[01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:38.580]   imploring Apostle Paul, "Stay and speak to us.
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:39.580]   "Give us more.
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:40.580]   "Preach it."
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:43.580]   I mean, they were the best congregation to preach to.
[01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:45.580]   So did they exhibit some fruit?
[01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:47.580]   Yes.
[01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:50.580]   Then how can fruit-bearing Christians
[01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:54.580]   constantly go back to their former way of life?
[01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:56.580]   Why does that happen?
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:58.580]   Take some time to meditate on that.
[01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:01.580]   Well, I want to give you some of my thoughts,
[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:04.580]   and I don't want to, like, take all the different options,
[01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:07.580]   but I do want you guys to think about the fact that, like,
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:11.580]   yes, sometimes, like, we are simple-minded,
[01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:15.580]   meaning there are a lot of us who just kind of want to be told,
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:17.580]   and then if somebody asks you, like, "Wait a minute.
[01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:18.580]   "Why are you doing that?"
[01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:22.580]   Your only response is, like, "He told me to do it," right?
[01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:24.580]   Like, that's our only answer is, like,
[01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:27.580]   "I wasn't really thinking," right?
[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:29.580]   Sometimes there's self-will, like,
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:32.580]   "I want to be the one to accomplish something."
[01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:34.580]   Sometimes there's just deep feelings.
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:37.580]   It's like, "Oh, my gosh, but my brother was in that group,
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:38.580]   "and, oh, my gosh, like,
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:40.580]   "they were making me feel so guilty about this,
[01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:42.580]   "and I don't want to be a jerk to tell them no,"
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:46.580]   and sometimes we're just driven by feelings.
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:47.580]   Just talk about that a little bit.
[01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:50.580]   If you're asking the question,
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:53.580]   think about even self-evaluation for you.
[01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:57.580]   I know we have seasons of great fruit-bearing as a Christian,
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:58.580]   and then we have times
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:00.580]   when we start reverting back to our old ways.
[01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:01.580]   Why?
[01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:05.580]   Well, one of the things here, he says,
[01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:07.580]   you have this desire.
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:09.580]   Now, this, I think, is a little bit more sarcastic, right?
[01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:12.580]   Like, you don't understand that when you do this,
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:14.580]   you're enslaving yourself.
[01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:16.580]   Again, is that what you want?
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:19.580]   But then, he says, as an example, this is what you do.
[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:22.580]   This is an example.
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:25.580]   Sorry, my handwriting there is so good, okay?
[01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:27.580]   I hope you get an example.
[01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:33.580]   You observe days, months, seasons, and years, okay?
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:38.580]   You observe days, months, seasons, and years.
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:41.580]   Now, obviously, my guess is a lot of you thought, like,
[01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:44.580]   "Oh, okay, he's so talking probably to the Jewish people
[01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:48.580]   "because they have so many different days, months," right?
[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:52.580]   You have everything from weekly Sabbath,
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:56.580]   then you have the quarterly, you know, the new moon,
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:59.580]   you have harvest, you have, like, the day of booths,
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:00.580]   and then you have that Yom Kippur,
[01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:02.580]   which is, like, super important.
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:03.580]   Then you have Rosh Hashanah.
[01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:06.580]   Like, you have so many significant moments
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:11.580]   in terms of the days they have to remember and celebrate, right?
[01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:13.580]   But actually, I think last week, I said,
[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:16.580]   "You know, Apostle Paul in the book of Colossians,
[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:18.580]   "he actually encompassed all of them."
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:23.580]   And he said, "You guys, you guys keep turning to the elemental things,
[01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:26.580]   "and you guys keep succumbing to people's judgment over you
[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:27.580]   "through these elemental things."
[01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:29.580]   And he mentions to the Jewish people,
[01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:32.580]   he mentions Sabbath, new moon, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:24:32.580 --> 01:24:35.580]   But then he also talks about those individuals who look to stars,
[01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:37.580]   and what are they doing?
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:40.580]   They're looking at their mystic calendar,
[01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:43.580]   they're looking at astrology, they're looking at horoscope,
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:46.580]   they're looking at stuff like, "Oh, my gosh, it's the Year of the Dragon!"
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:49.580]   Right? All this stuff.
[01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:53.580]   Whether Jewish or pagan, there's all these days that people look at.
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:57.580]   But why am I making note of that?
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:25:06.580]   I do think that there is a kind of, I guess, simplicity.
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:08.580]   I guess there's a-- when I think about it,
[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:11.580]   when you think about the easiest form of legalism,
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:15.580]   it's just to follow along, it's just to show up.
[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:18.580]   It's like, you know, I pray when it's scheduled time to pray.
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:20.580]   I prayed. You're done.
[01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:22.580]   And the rest of the week, rest of the month, you're like,
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:25.580]   "Oh, yeah, I never really prayed."
[01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:27.580]   So for you, I have this question.
[01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:32.580]   If Sunday you put your, "Okay, I'm going to start the Bible cap on,"
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:34.580]   and then the rest of the week, when it's not time,
[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:37.580]   when it's not scheduled, when we're not gathered,
[01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:39.580]   you don't have a hunger for Jesus,
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:41.580]   you don't have a hunger to please him,
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:43.580]   you don't have a hunger to evangelize,
[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:45.580]   you're not really seeking him out,
[01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:48.580]   but then you put your caps on on those appointed times,
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:50.580]   what are you doing?
[01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:54.580]   You're just observing days, months, and years, right?
[01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:57.580]   And why do we do that then?
[01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:00.580]   It's because that's easy.
[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:02.580]   And how is that offensive to God?
[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:05.580]   Because for you to think, "Look, God, I washed my hands.
[01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:07.580]   Do you love me?"
[01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:10.580]   Or, "Look, God, I showed up on Sunday. Do you love me?"
[01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:13.580]   "Look, God, I kept Saturday clear for you."
[01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:18.580]   Do you think God is that easily pleased?
[01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:21.580]   Do you think God is that easily manipulated?
[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:25.580]   "But I washed my hands. You expected me to do more?"
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:28.580]   That's a weird way to think of God.
[01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:31.580]   The reason why legalism is so offensive to God
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:33.580]   is because God was a God who was offended.
[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:35.580]   He was a holy God who was offended by our sin.
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:39.580]   We come, and it's like, "But I washed my hands on Saturday."
[01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:41.580]   That's such a weird way to see God.
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:43.580]   Does that make sense?
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:45.580]   We put God in a strange place
[01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:49.580]   where he's supposed to accept our bare minimum.
[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:53.580]   That's why legalism is offensive to the Lord.
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:58.580]   Okay, so in thinking about that,
[01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.580]   I want us to know, like,
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:03.580]   this little portion we should discuss.
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:07.580]   In what ways is observing days, months, and seasons
[01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:10.580]   such an easy thing for you and I to fall into?
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:12.580]   In what ways?
[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:16.580]   Maybe it's a way in which you've sinned or fallen short
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:18.580]   or you failed in some way.
[01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:20.580]   If you just put your cap on on Wednesday
[01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:22.580]   and you act like nothing happened,
[01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:25.580]   you're just observing the days, right?
[01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:27.580]   It has to do with dealing with your heart.
[01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:29.580]   It has to do with getting right with God.
[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:32.580]   And these are the things we know.
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:35.580]   Okay, so in thinking about this,
[01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:38.580]   I want to make a side note here.
[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:39.580]   The tone.
[01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:41.580]   Last week, I kept mentioning
[01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:43.580]   and asking this question about the tone.
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:47.580]   And obviously, the tone is, like, really serious, right?
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:52.580]   The tone is filled with both frustration,
[01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:55.580]   both just an astounded, like, "What?"
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:59.580]   But it's also filled with a lot of concern.
[01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:02.580]   The whole paragraph has with so much fear,
[01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:04.580]   concern, and worry in it.
[01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:06.580]   And I wanted to make a side note
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:09.580]   that when he is describing the weak and the worthless,
[01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:12.580]   these were some really descriptive terms.
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:15.580]   If you got a chance to look at this one in particular,
[01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:17.580]   you will notice that in your translations,
[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:20.580]   it was translated into multiple different ways.
[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:22.580]   The miserable, the beggarly,
[01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:27.580]   because the term has a broad sense and meaning.
[01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:30.580]   It is this word here, and it's very descriptive,
[01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:32.580]   as one who is crouching,
[01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:34.580]   one who is cowering like a beggar,
[01:28:34.580 --> 01:28:36.580]   one who is poor, helpless,
[01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:38.580]   someone who is in abject poverty,
[01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:42.580]   utter helplessness, or complete destruction.
[01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:44.580]   Whoa.
[01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:46.580]   That is one rich term.
[01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:49.580]   This is the many uses in different places
[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:50.580]   that this term was used.
[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:53.580]   And then if you look at the variations of this word,
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:56.580]   it continues to basically reiterate this thought
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:58.580]   that it is like a beggar.
[01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:02.580]   And then so, in terms of the tone of this paragraph,
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:07.580]   it made me think, how heart-wrenching, right?
[01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:10.580]   How heart-wrenching to think if you were the one
[01:29:10.580 --> 01:29:13.580]   who was in the God figure, the parental figure,
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:17.580]   and you prepared, again, not just days and months,
[01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:20.580]   but years for the adoption of a child.
[01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:22.580]   You prepared your home, you prepared the documents,
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:25.580]   you prepared your family, you prepared your friends.
[01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:28.580]   Not even like a homecoming party, all of that,
[01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:31.580]   only to receive the child into your home
[01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:36.580]   and then to catch him digging through your trash.
[01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:41.580]   Half of you would be like, "Oh, what are you doing?"
[01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:44.580]   But the other half of you would feel pity.
[01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:47.580]   Is that what you're used to, right?
[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:50.580]   I think the tone of it has the same kind of thought.
[01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:51.580]   Why?
[01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:54.580]   Because in this admonition and in this charge
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:57.580]   to not go back to the flesh,
[01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:00.580]   here he starts to get really personal and says,
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:05.580]   "I fear for you, that perhaps I labor for you in vain.
[01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:07.580]   "I'm begging you."
[01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:10.580]   I want to switch now to the second half of the paragraph
[01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:14.580]   and to highlight that the paragraph actually goes
[01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:16.580]   all the way down to verse 20, okay?
[01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:18.580]   It goes all the way down to verse 20.
[01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:21.580]   And essentially, he starts to share his worried concern
[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:24.580]   and then he starts to bring up their relationships.
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:27.580]   He says, "Oh my goodness, before you were so good to me,
[01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:28.580]   "what changed?
[01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:31.580]   "By me telling you not to go down this horrible path,
[01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:32.580]   "am I now your enemy?
[01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:33.580]   "What's happening?"
[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:36.580]   And he's so perplexed and he starts to call on them
[01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:39.580]   like his children and he says, "I wish I was with you."
[01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:41.580]   And so that's why I bring up that analogy.
[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:46.580]   The tone is very, very intimate, okay?
[01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:50.580]   As we think about this, I'm pretty sure you guys wondered like,
[01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:52.580]   "Oh man, this is crazy."
[01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:56.580]   He asked this question, "Perhaps I labored over you in vain."
[01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:57.580]   And I asked the question,
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:01.580]   "Does Paul think that they are not Christian?"
[01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:03.580]   "Does Paul think that they are not Christian?"
[01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:07.580]   Well, I think this is why sometimes the Scripture is so profound
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:11.580]   because it includes all the real emotions.
[01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:15.580]   If you guys have ever tried to disciple, minister to,
[01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:18.580]   or draw back a wayward Christian,
[01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:21.580]   now your mind is going all over the place like,
[01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:23.580]   "Why won't you listen?"
[01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:24.580]   Right?
[01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:26.580]   And then the thought starts coming like,
[01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:28.580]   "Your heart's getting hardened."
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:29.580]   And then you start worrying
[01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:31.580]   and then you start actually wondering,
[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:33.580]   "Is the truth in you?"
[01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:34.580]   Right?
[01:31:34.580 --> 01:31:38.580]   But then praise the Lord, he later on in Galatians 5.10 says,
[01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:41.580]   "I have this confidence in you in the Lord.
[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:44.580]   "You will not adopt another view."
[01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:45.580]   Right?
[01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:47.580]   And he calls them brothers and he's praying for them
[01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:48.580]   and all this kind of stuff.
[01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:50.580]   So all I'm going to say is,
[01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:53.580]   this is just like a very real passage
[01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:55.580]   where he starts to get very personal
[01:31:55.580 --> 01:31:58.580]   about his sentiments towards the church.
[01:31:58.580 --> 01:31:59.580]   Okay?
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:02.580]   And then that leads him to beg,
[01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:03.580]   to beg them.
[01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:04.580]   Okay?
[01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:06.580]   And I want to make the point and highlight the fact
[01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:08.580]   that in his begging,
[01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:09.580]   he is pleading with them,
[01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:10.580]   he is entreating them.
[01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:12.580]   And again, the translations kind of show
[01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:15.580]   that this is another vivid, vivid term.
[01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:17.580]   And the way that that term is used
[01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:19.580]   most frequently in the scriptures
[01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:21.580]   is when somebody is going to God
[01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:22.580]   and making a prayer request and saying,
[01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:24.580]   "God, this is not my preference.
[01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:27.580]   "This is my dire need."
[01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:28.580]   When it boils down to,
[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:30.580]   "If I had one opportunity to go to you
[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:33.580]   "and I'm requesting you this,"
[01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:35.580]   this is that kind of prayer.
[01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:37.580]   It's most often used in a prayer context.
[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:38.580]   Okay?
[01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:40.580]   Most often used in a prayer context.
[01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:43.580]   So then, knowing that Apostle Paul
[01:32:43.580 --> 01:32:46.580]   is making that kind of emphatic pleading
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:48.580]   with the church,
[01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:51.580]   what is he actually asking for when he says,
[01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:54.580]   "Become as I am,
[01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:59.580]   "for also I have become as you are."
[01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:01.580]   Honestly, that's where in my own Bible study,
[01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:04.580]   I was like, "What?
[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:05.580]   "What do you mean?"
[01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:08.580]   So what did you guys get?
[01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:09.580]   Eye contact?
[01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:11.580]   (laughs)
[01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:12.580]   Any thoughts?
[01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:14.580]   Volunteer?
[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:15.580]   This is an important one
[01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:18.580]   because this is the command.
[01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:20.580]   Become as I am.
[01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:23.580]   What a weird way to put it.
[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:28.580]   And I've become like you.
[01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:30.580]   Thoughts?
[01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:32.580]   Going once?
[01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:34.580]   For 10 points?
[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:35.580]   Twice?
[01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:36.580]   Okay.
[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:41.580]   Well, I'm going to read you a parallel passage
[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:43.580]   just to get the effect of it, okay?
[01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:46.580]   What does it mean to become as I am?
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:49.580]   Well, in a very similar tone,
[01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:51.580]   in a very similar seriousness
[01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:53.580]   of the text that we're in,
[01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:54.580]   in the book of Philippians,
[01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:55.580]   Apostle Paul says here
[01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:57.580]   with really, really fierce words,
[01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:59.580]   "Beware of the dogs."
[01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:00.580]   Wow.
[01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:02.580]   But it's actually really, really similar
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:04.580]   to the way that Apostle Paul speaks in Galatians.
[01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:07.580]   It's like, "Those individuals who would disturb you,
[01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:10.580]   "I wish they would mutilate themselves."
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:12.580]   He says, "Beware of the evil workers.
[01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.580]   "Beware of the false circumcision."
[01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:16.580]   Moving forward to verse 4.
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:17.580]   "If anyone else has a mind
[01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:19.580]   "to put confidence in the flesh,
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:22.580]   "I far more circumcise the eighth day
[01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:24.580]   "of the nation of Israel,
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:25.580]   "of the tribe of Benjamin,
[01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:26.580]   "a Hebrew of Hebrews,
[01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:28.580]   "as to the law of Pharisee,
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:31.580]   "as to zeal of persecutor of the church,
[01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:32.580]   "as to the righteousness
[01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:34.580]   "which is in the law found blameless.
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:37.580]   "But whatever things were gained to me,
[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:39.580]   "those things I have counted as loss
[01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:40.580]   "for the sake of Christ,
[01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:43.580]   "become like me.
[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:45.580]   "I have believed upon the sufficiency of Christ.
[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:48.580]   "I place no, no glory in my flesh,
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:50.580]   "but glory in only Christ.
[01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:51.580]   "Amen?
[01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:53.580]   "Be like me."
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:55.580]   And then he says, "Moreover,
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:56.580]   "more than that,
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:57.580]   "I count all things to be lost
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:59.580]   "in view of the surpassing value
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:02.580]   "of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord,
[01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:05.580]   "for whom I have suffered the loss of all things,
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:07.580]   "and count them rubbish
[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:09.580]   "so that I may gain Christ
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:11.580]   "and may be found in him.
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:13.580]   "Not having a righteousness of my own
[01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:14.580]   "derived from the law,
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:16.580]   "but that which through faith in Christ,

[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:20.580]   "that I may know him

[01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:24.580]   "and the fellowship of his suffering,
[01:35:24.580 --> 01:35:26.580]   "being conformed to his death

[01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:30.580]   "to the resurrection from the dead.
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:32.580]   "Be like me."
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:34.580]   This is what you believed, right?
[01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:39.580]   The absolute sufficiency of Christ.
[01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:41.580]   Guys, in a way,
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:43.580]   kind of like summarizing some of this stuff,
[01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:46.580]   I genuinely feel like we are,
[01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:48.580]   in different ways similarly,
[01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:51.580]   attacked with superficial,
[01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:55.580]   very, very earthly, fleshly ideologies,
[01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:58.580]   just as powerful as blatant legalism.
[01:35:58.580 --> 01:35:59.580]   Blatant legalism is,
[01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:03.580]   you must be circumcised to be saved and righteous.
[01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:04.580]   Yes?
[01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:05.580]   Are there not those attacks
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:08.580]   in a different tone today?
[01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:11.580]   You must say the right stuff.
[01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:13.580]   You must be of this camp.
[01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:15.580]   You must be about social justice.
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:17.580]   You must be about this.
[01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:20.580]   And there are movements and stuff like that.
[01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:23.580]   But anything, anything that you experience
[01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:26.580]   that gives you confidence in the flesh,
[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:28.580]   it is utterly demonic.
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:29.580]   And if it feels like,
[01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:30.580]   oh my gosh,
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:33.580]   why are the teachers, the elders, the pastors
[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:35.580]   always so serious about this?
[01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:36.580]   Think about this.
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:37.580]   I mean,
[01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:39.580]   the Apostle Paul is mentioning just days,
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:40.580]   rituals, and stuff like that.
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:42.580]   And he says, "But do you understand?
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:45.580]   "It's like you're acting like you don't know God.
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:48.580]   "You're going back to slavery."
[01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:49.580]   So I can imagine,
[01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:52.580]   I can imagine somebody in the church saying like,
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:55.580]   "Oh my gosh, why are you taking it so hard, you know?
[01:36:55.580 --> 01:36:57.580]   "In the beginning we were just doing Bible study
[01:36:57.580 --> 01:36:58.580]   "and it was great.
[01:36:58.580 --> 01:37:00.580]   "And then these guys who are leaders
[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:01.580]   "of the Jewish people,
[01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:02.580]   "they came in and were like,
[01:37:02.580 --> 01:37:03.580]   "'Wow, this is great,'
[01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:04.580]   "because they converted.
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:05.580]   "And then they were telling us like,
[01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:07.580]   "'We have to be holy,'
[01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:08.580]   "and it sounded good.
[01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:10.580]   "And we have to follow the law of God."
[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:11.580]   And we said, "Amen."
[01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:12.580]   And then they said,
[01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:13.580]   "We have to be circumcised."
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:14.580]   And we were like,
[01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:17.580]   "Oh, I don't know, but I guess."
[01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:21.580]   You know, why are you taking this so seriously?
[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:23.580]   Apostle Paul is trying to show us
[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:25.580]   the consequences
[01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:29.580]   of even just that kind of perversion of the gospel.
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:33.580]   You make Christ null and void, right?
[01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:37.580]   And so he's awaking us to those kinds of thoughts.
[01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:38.580]   This last, last segment,
[01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:41.580]   I'm gonna actually save majority of it for the next time,
[01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:44.580]   because the flow of thought here,
[01:37:44.580 --> 01:37:46.580]   verse 12b,
[01:37:46.580 --> 01:37:49.580]   it's kind of like a weird place to put the verses,
[01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:51.580]   but I had this question like,
[01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:54.580]   "Whoa, is verse 12 through 14
[01:37:54.580 --> 01:37:56.580]   "trying to support this idea of like,
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:59.580]   "'I beg you to become like me,' right?
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:02.580]   "Or is this a separate thought?"
[01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:05.580]   My just preview for the next time
[01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:08.580]   is going to be this is
[01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:11.580]   a movement of his personal thoughts.
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:12.580]   "I fear for you.
[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:13.580]   "I'm begging you.
[01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:17.580]   "And you and I have this relationship, right?
[01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:19.580]   "You trusted me before.
[01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:21.580]   "You were so good to me.
[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:23.580]   "Before, you never did me wrong.
[01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:25.580]   "I was super-duper sick."
[01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:28.580]   I think Apostle Paul describes like he was so near death
[01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:29.580]   because of his illnesses,
[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:32.580]   and then he moved over to this Galatia area,
[01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:34.580]   and then in that moment,
[01:38:34.580 --> 01:38:36.580]   he had to move over because of his sickness,
[01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:38.580]   but while he was moving, he was preaching,
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:40.580]   and there was fruitfulness there.
[01:38:40.580 --> 01:38:41.580]   So what he was saying was,
[01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:43.580]   "Because of my sickness, God allowed me to come here
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:44.580]   "and I was preaching to you,
[01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:47.580]   "and at that time, you didn't think of me as a burden.
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:49.580]   "You received me.
[01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:51.580]   "You received all my words."
[01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:54.580]   And then it's going to be a setup for,
[01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:57.580]   "So where is that, right?
[01:38:57.580 --> 01:38:59.580]   "What happened?"
[01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:03.580]   And then what can we observe then about their relationship is
[01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:06.580]   although we would like to think
[01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:09.580]   that we're humble enough to receive exhortation,
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:11.580]   that we're humble enough to receive rebuke,
[01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:15.580]   you can tell the church had moments when they were not.
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:17.580]   They probably started accusing Apostle Paul
[01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:19.580]   of being lesser than them.
[01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:21.580]   They were like, "What are you doing?
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:23.580]   "You're trying to mess up this good thing we have."
[01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:25.580]   I don't know what they said exactly,
[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:28.580]   but Apostle Paul now is grieving like,
[01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:29.580]   "Man, I loved upon you.
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:31.580]   "I taught you.
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:33.580]   "What happened?"
[01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:34.580]   Right?
[01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:35.580]   "What happened?"
[01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:38.580]   And so with that said, stay tuned for next time
[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:42.580]   when you guys study the passage going from verse 15 through 20,
[01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:44.580]   think about the ministry.
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:46.580]   Think about the relationship.
[01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:49.580]   Think about how Apostle Paul is treating those
[01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:51.580]   who are bearing fruit at once,
[01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:56.580]   being swayed to believe this false gospel,
[01:39:56.580 --> 01:39:59.580]   and perhaps now being defensive about it in this time.
[01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:02.580]   All right, let's take a moment to pray to wrap up.
[01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:12.580]   Lord God, there was so much to glean from this passage,
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:17.580]   but Lord, the theme of the Scripture is to stay on Christ,
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:21.580]   that Lord, having a relationship with you,
[01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:23.580]   that's the substance.
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:26.580]   Everything else is just a help.
[01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:29.580]   Everything else is a tool for us to get to you.
[01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:33.580]   Even your law, even what you've taught in the Old Testament,
[01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:38.580]   all the examples were for us to fully see you.
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:42.580]   And so I pray, Father God, that we would be so clinging to Christ
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:47.580]   that we're not susceptible to movements of our day,
[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:50.580]   spectacular preachers of our day,
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:54.580]   and definitely we're not susceptible to our own laziness and vices.
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:57.580]   I pray, Father God, that if any of us here,
[01:40:57.580 --> 01:41:01.580]   that we were coasting along and we were just showing up,
[01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:03.580]   but Lord God, we weren't hungering for you,
[01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:08.580]   would you cause us now to be rebuked, corrected,
[01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:12.580]   and then to realize, Lord God, that we need to be seeking you with all our hearts.
[01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:16.580]   Father, we pray that by the nourishment and the conviction of your Spirit,
[01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:18.580]   you would help us, Lord God, to walk with you daily.
[01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:21.580]   It's in Christ's name. Amen.
[01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:23.580]   Okay.
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:28.580]   All right, with that said, we have just a few announcements for you guys,
[01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:30.580]   and then we'll put up the discussion questions.
[01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:51.580]   All right, just a couple of announcements.
[01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:57.580]   We are going to try to close the men's ministry workshop.
[01:41:57.580 --> 01:42:02.580]   Please do sign up by tonight so that I can put the small groups together tomorrow.
[01:42:02.580 --> 01:42:08.580]   The $10 is going to include breakfast, refreshments, as well as a catered lunch.
[01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:13.580]   So Pastor Sung Kang is coming from Foundation Mission Church,
[01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:17.580]   and he's going to be sharing about just the personal holiness of the men.
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:23.580]   So ladies, if you can pray that the men of our church really will grow in holiness
[01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:28.580]   that we better serve the church as we grow.
[01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:33.580]   So if you haven't signed up by now, please do so, okay,
[01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:36.580]   so that we can kind of put the groups together.
[01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:41.580]   Also, March 9th, which is just a few Saturdays away,
[01:42:41.580 --> 01:42:44.580]   we are having an all-church cleaning and maintenance day.
[01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:49.580]   If you guys can come, the more the merrier, please do come.
[01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:51.580]   It's going to be from like 9 to 12.
[01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:58.580]   It is a good opportunity really to just kind of clear out and clean up the facility.
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:02.580]   And a couple of upcoming things that are important to remember.
[01:43:02.580 --> 01:43:08.580]   Next Friday, the BAM is going to just the winter retreat.
[01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:11.580]   So if you guys can keep that in prayer.
[01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:15.580]   The theme is "The End is Near," okay?
[01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:18.580]   And it's ominous, but that's the theme.
[01:43:18.580 --> 01:43:22.580]   And we're going to be looking at 1 Peter 4 for the whole of the retreat.
[01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:24.580]   So please pray for that.
[01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:26.580]   Next Wednesday night we have Bible study.
[01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:31.580]   And then the following week we don't because that week we have all-church praise and prayer.
[01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:34.580]   And Pastor Peter Kim is going to be leading us through that time.
[01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:37.580]   So kind of book that on your calendar.
[01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:40.580]   And then our six-week Old Testament survey class,
[01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:43.580]   Pastor Peter announced this on Sunday.
[01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:48.580]   That's going to go from 2 to 3.30-ish every Sunday afternoon in the sanctuary.
[01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:54.580]   So please sign up for that if you are preparing to come.
[01:43:54.580 --> 01:44:01.580]   Over the last five or six years, we've had evening Passion Week devotions and stuff.
[01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:06.580]   And so this year it's not going to be any different Monday through Wednesday at 7.30.
[01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:12.580]   We're going to be gathering together for just a time of reflection, devotion.
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:19.580]   The BAM is going to have a prayer meeting on that Tuesday before the evening.
[01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:26.580]   And then Thursday, it's actually going to be pulled up the time, and we're going to have a Passover dinner.
[01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:35.580]   And so Pastor Mark is going to be walking us through how a first-century Jewish family would actually have the Passover feast.
[01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:40.580]   So it definitely is worthwhile to participate in, especially if you haven't done it before.
[01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:46.580]   So if you are a member and you've never done it, you're going to be given priority.
[01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:51.580]   So seating is limited. You are going to be asked. We're going to treat it like a formal event.
[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:56.580]   So that'll be Thursday. Friday, we're going to have a Good Friday service with communion.
[01:44:56.580 --> 01:45:03.580]   So please also keep that in mind in addition to our Sunday sunrise service followed by three services.
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:12.580]   So these are things that are upcoming. More than just to put on the calendar, just blanket these events in prayer
[01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:19.580]   for all the leaders that are involved and try to make it to everything and really be present.
[01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:30.580]   Thank you. These are the discussion questions we're going to leave you with, and then we'll wrap up our Bible study formally this way.
[01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:33.580]   Thank you.
