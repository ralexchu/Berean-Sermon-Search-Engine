[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   that we may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.200]   We pray, Father God, that your grace would be sufficient
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.640]   to listen and to apply all that you have.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.640]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.600]   What are the three virtues of Christianity?
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.160]   Faith, hope, and love.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.160]   So those are the three things.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.680]   So if you search through the scriptures,
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.520]   you'll find that those three virtues are scattered
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.320]   all throughout scripture.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.000]   That when you're talking about our salvation
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.720]   and hope in Christ,
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.080]   either we're talking about faith,
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.600]   how justification is by faith alone,
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.320]   and then because of this justification,
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.240]   hope is what causes us to persevere
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.000]   and cause us to get us to our glorification.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.840]   But in the end, scripture says in 1 Corinthians 13,
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.000]   of faith, of hope, and of love,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.140]   these three things will abide.
[00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.920]   But the greatest of these is love.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.600]   Now why do you think that Paul identifies
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.720]   that love is the greatest?
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.960]   Does he actually even need to do that?
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.520]   Considering that our whole connection with God,
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.080]   your salvation, my salvation,
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.120]   is dependent upon this faith.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.880]   And then if you have this faith,
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.280]   this faith gives us hope,
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.040]   and hope is what causes us to persevere.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.040]   It is a source of our joy,
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.560]   and even in the context of suffering
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.000]   that we talked about last week.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.360]   But why does he feel the need in Corinthians
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.000]   to identify that love is greater than these?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.960]   I would think that they would all equally be important.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.160]   But why does he identify love above the other two?
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.500]   I think the reason why he does that
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.840]   is because clearly the scripture teaches us
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.720]   that the purpose of faith and hope
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.440]   is to ultimately bring us to love.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.240]   The Bible describes our salvation
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.160]   as having fallen short.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.560]   And so the goal of salvation
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.920]   is to get us back to God,
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.200]   and ultimately it is to have
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.480]   this love relationship with God.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.960]   So the goal of faith is love.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.040]   The purpose of hope is love.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.040]   As Jesus says,
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.240]   "The greatest commandment can be summed up
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.760]   in 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.280]   soul, mind, and strength.'"
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.480]   So the greatest purpose of salvation is to love.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.440]   And again, in Ephesians 3, 17 to 19,
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.840]   those of you guys who know the book of Ephesians,
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.560]   it's divided into two parts.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.600]   You have the indicatives and the imperatives.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.440]   The first three chapters are about what salvation is,
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.360]   how Jesus loved us, how he pursued us.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.840]   And then starting from chapter four through six,
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.560]   it's a description of, therefore,
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.920]   how we ought to live.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.920]   But at the end,
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.200]   at the conclusion of three chapters
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.400]   of revelation about our salvation,
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.160]   he concludes with all this knowledge
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.320]   that he's presented to them by saying,
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.000]   "My prayer is that Christ may dwell in your hearts
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.240]   through faith,
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.080]   that you being rooted and grounded in love
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.440]   may have the strength to comprehend
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.440]   with all the saints
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.240]   what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.400]   and to know the love of Christ
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.680]   that surpasses knowledge,
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.040]   that you may be filled with all the fullness of God."
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.360]   So I want to stop a minute
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.640]   and just highlight what he says at the end of that.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.080]   He says, "To be filled with the fullness of God,
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.200]   that you need to be able to grasp
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.840]   the breadth, length, height, and depth,
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.160]   and to know the love of Christ
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.680]   that surpasses knowledge."
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.440]   In order to have the fullness of God in us,
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.320]   we need to be able to grasp the love of Christ.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.300]   Jesus himself said
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.600]   that the very identifying mark of a Christian,
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.520]   he didn't say holiness,
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.600]   not to say that the Bible doesn't teach us
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.600]   that we have to be holy.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.040]   God is holy, so therefore we ought to be holy.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.800]   But he said the identifying mark,
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.560]   the single identifying mark
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.080]   of a follower of Jesus Christ is love.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.880]   Not religiosity, not church attendance,
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.160]   and not how much you give,
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.860]   and not how many disciples you make,
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:05.960]   but love.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.840]   And the love that he has for us
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.620]   reflected in our lives.
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.360]   Paul himself says in 2 Corinthians 5.14,
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.080]   "With all the pressure he feels
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.280]   of persecution, of being beaten,
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.160]   people betraying him,
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.280]   and people actually even questioning him,
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.800]   you know, is God really speaking through you?
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.160]   Are you truly an apostle?"
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.500]   And in the context of all of this,
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.560]   he says he perseveres,
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.200]   and the reason why he perseveres,
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.480]   2 Corinthians 5.14, he says,
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.200]   "Love of Christ controls us."
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.480]   In some of our translations,
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.960]   it says it compels us.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.640]   So the reason why we do what we do is love.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.500]   What causes us to continue to do what we do is love.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.400]   The whole purpose of salvation
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.040]   is so that we may experience more of this love.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.240]   So it is no exaggeration that
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.480]   when we talk about justification by faith,
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.680]   that his whole point,
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.400]   and where he's been leading us,
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.900]   is through the text that we're reading right now.
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.400]   Which in starting from verse five through verse 11,
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.440]   he's basically describing the love of God.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.800]   So this morning,
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.680]   we're gonna be looking at these few verses,
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.480]   we're gonna start it this morning,
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.940]   because it expounds his love.
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.340]   It talks about who loves us,
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.640]   when he loved us,
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.040]   how he loved us,
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.520]   and then we'll briefly talk about why he loved us.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.800]   So first of all,
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.320]   the most important part of this,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.840]   I believe, that starts it off is who loves us.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.440]   Every single one of us,
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.880]   I mean, who doesn't want to be loved?
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.040]   We would say that food, shelter, and love
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.880]   is essential in every human being's life.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.920]   And when we're loved, we change.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.360]   Whether it's the love of our parents,
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.360]   or love of husband and wife,
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.320]   or a romantic love, whatever that may be,
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.280]   when we are loved, and we feel loved, we change.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.200]   But who loves us?
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.880]   The fact that this passage begins
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.120]   by teaching us that it is God.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.240]   Again, there's no exposition of who God is in this text,
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.280]   but again, in order for us to fully appreciate
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.560]   what he's going to say about love,
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.000]   we need to first understand,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.520]   again, it's nothing new,
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.640]   but this is, again, as a reminder to us
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.980]   why this is so significant.
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.160]   Who loves us?
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.840]   Deuteronomy 6, four.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.920]   I think the family retreat,
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.240]   not family, the family retreat,
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.040]   the main theme is Deuteronomy 6, five, right?
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.400]   Or 6, four is the great Shema,
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.960]   and it says, "Hear, O Israel,
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.840]   "the Lord our God, the Lord is one."
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.160]   Called the great Shema,
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.560]   is a great proclamation,
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.940]   and so in the Jewish community,
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.640]   they would hang this on the doorpost
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.520]   to remind them every time they walked in
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.900]   and out of their home,
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.640]   to be reminded that there is only one God,
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.000]   and that God is your God, right?
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.600]   A simple statement,
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.120]   but they were reminded this
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.520]   every time they entered the house,
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.300]   every time they exited the house,
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.520]   that the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.680]   There is no one like your God.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.840]   In Psalm 19, one through four,
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.640]   it says, "The heavens declare the glory of God,
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.160]   "and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.640]   "Day to day pours out speech,
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.320]   "and night to night reveals knowledge.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.560]   "There is no speech, nor are there words
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.180]   "whose voice is not heard.
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.460]   "Their measuring line goes out through all the earth,
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.020]   "and their words to the end of the world.
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.400]   "In them he has set a tent for the sun."
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.200]   I could have chosen probably, you know,
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.560]   hundreds of verses that would fit that same category,
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.400]   describing God in this way,
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.140]   that all of creation declares his glory.
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:32.520]   The God who is about to expound his love toward us
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.360]   is the God who created everything.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.020]   You know, we sometimes get short-sighted, again,
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.800]   that when we experience love,
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.360]   when somebody remembers our birthday,
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.580]   you know, buys a little cupcake,
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.320]   and you know, say, "Oh my God, that affects us.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.880]   "It affects us for a week, you know, a month."
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.640]   And sometimes for longer than that.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.660]   "Oh, I remember my birthday,
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.940]   "or somebody brought me flowers,
[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.000]   "or took me out to lunch.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.080]   "Yeah, I remember, you were so kind to me."
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.920]   Right?
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.360]   But when we recognize who it is
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.760]   that is expressing his love toward us,
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.360]   that in and of itself should cause us
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.040]   to stop in our tracks.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.520]   Isaiah chapter six, one, two, three.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.040]   Now I know you guys know that passage well.
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.160]   It is a calling of Isaiah into his prophetic ministry.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.980]   But I want you to read the first part of it
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.900]   when it says, "In the year," in verse one,
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.220]   "In the year that King Uzziah died,
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.520]   "I saw the Lord sitting upon the throne."
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.800]   Typically, we kind of focus on the holy, holy, holy aspect
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.320]   of this passage, and where he falls down,
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.740]   woe is me, woe is me, I am nothing.
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.980]   But I want to stop in the very first line,
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.180]   where it says the political environment,
[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.800]   the historical environment behind where this happens
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.920]   is when King Uzziah dies.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.160]   King Uzziah, was he a good king or a bad king?
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.760]   Those of you who are studying with us in Isaiah,
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.400]   I want this like pop quiz.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.980]   Okay, I'm gonna grade all of you.
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.040]   Is King Uzziah a good king or a bad king?
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.880]   He was a good king.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.320]   How many good kings were there
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.480]   in the nation of Israel?
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.960]   Okay, very few.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.800]   Like very few.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.400]   There was exactly, it was about eight of them.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   King Uzziah was actually one of the very few good kings
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.720]   in the nation of Israel.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.300]   So almost every king before him,
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.360]   and almost every king after him was no good.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.400]   They were corrupt.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.580]   And so they were under the judgment of God.
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.600]   They were being attacked,
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.080]   and they were going back and forth.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.960]   But Uzziah was actually a good king.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.980]   During his reign, God blesses the nation of Israel.
[00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:37.940]   What happens in this scene is Uzziah dies.
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.000]   And as a result of Uzziah dying,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   there's a turmoil in the nation.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.220]   What are we going to do?
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.400]   We finally get a good king,
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.760]   and then he dies, and then the throne is empty.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.120]   And so God is showing him a vision
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.640]   to basically tell Isaiah and the nation of Israel,
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.940]   the real king is still on the throne.
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.760]   Uzziah might have died, and the throne may be empty,
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.100]   but the God of gods and the king of kings is still here.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.960]   And that is the vision that he gives to Isaiah,
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.060]   basically telling Isaiah, "Everything is good.
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.020]   "I am absolutely still in control."
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.660]   And it is in that context, he says,
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.500]   "He saw a throne high and lifted up,
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.680]   "and the train of his robe filled with the temple.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.120]   "Above him stood seraphims, each with six wings,
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.420]   "with two covered his face, with two he covered his feet,
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.700]   "and with two he flew.
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.100]   "And one called to another and said,
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.540]   "'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.740]   "'The whole earth is full of his glory.'"
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:43.700]   Before Isaiah was commissioned to go represent God,
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.260]   he needed to first and foremost recognize who God is.
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.420]   And that the God that he's going to represent,
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.580]   the God who has called him to speak on his behalf,
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.900]   he needed to see the glimpse of his glory
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.500]   so that he may represent him properly.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.980]   So for us to understand justification by faith,
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.620]   that this is an expression of love,
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.140]   we need to first and foremost understand who it is
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.420]   that is declaring his love for us.
[00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:14.180]   Right now, the political environment that we hear
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.300]   all the time is they're afraid that North Korea
[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.380]   is going to get nuclear bombs.
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.900]   And every time there's uranium or something going on,
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.060]   coming back and forth in North Korea,
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.140]   everybody freaks out.
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.940]   Now, I want you to see it from North Korean perspective.
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.380]   And it's not because I'm from North Korea,
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.420]   this is just hypothetical.
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.480]   I want you to hear this from North Korean perspective.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:38.380]   America, you have nuclear bombs, why can't we have any?
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:44.940]   I mean, if you're a child playing in the playground,
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.180]   and one kid has a stick and the other kid wants a stick,
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.020]   it's like you can't have a stick
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.980]   because it's dangerous in your hands, right?
[00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.860]   Well, the other kid's like, "You got a stick?
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.500]   Why can't I have a stick?"
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.940]   Very simple, right?
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:58.780]   End of argument.
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.140]   North Korea should have nuclear bombs, right?
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.820]   I hope that's not what you're thinking.
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.060]   The reason why everybody is concerned about North Korea
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.300]   having nuclear bombs is because nuclear bomb,
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.180]   the power that it has, in the hands of an unstable
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:18.180]   government that is willing to destroy maybe even the world.
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.220]   And that's what they're concerned about.
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.480]   Imagine if you never knew anything about the gospel.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.100]   That you didn't grow up in the church,
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.500]   you never heard the name Jesus Christ,
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.300]   you never heard about him being crucified for us,
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.060]   and you, for the first time in your life,
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.180]   realize that God who created the universe,
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.900]   whose very reason why you are even breathing today,
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.900]   why the earth is rotating at a consistent speed,
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.440]   why we don't burn out and we don't freeze to death,
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.580]   that all that power is in this being's hands,
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.020]   that he's real.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:56.460]   And that not only is he real, he is omniscient.
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:00.660]   And he knows all your deeds, he knows all your thoughts.
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:06.300]   Would your first response be, thank God you exist.
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.080]   Would that be your first response?
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.940]   Probably not.
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:15.160]   Your first response would be probably terror.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.320]   Because you're gonna be combing through everything
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.220]   that you've been hiding from other people.
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.100]   Every sin that you committed in darkness,
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.860]   every crime that you committed,
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.300]   every corner that you cut, every lie that you've told,
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.540]   everything that you've watched on the internet,
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.380]   everything that we've done that we've been trying
[00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.140]   so hard to hide and ashamed to tell other people
[00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:39.100]   to know that this powerful God who could squash me
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:43.540]   knows all of this stuff, would fill us with terror.
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.460]   That would be the normal, natural response
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.220]   of who you and I are, 'cause we have no power
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.700]   to do anything about it.
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.980]   It would make us much more nervous
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:55.460]   that this God would exist than North Korea
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.740]   having these nuclear bombs.
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:00.500]   'Cause these nuclear bombs, they're just bombs.
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.340]   I mean, it's very, very dangerous,
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.500]   but this being can actually squash us.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:11.380]   We grew up in the church, or a lot of us,
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.440]   or sometimes we've been in the church so long,
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.240]   we just assume the love of God.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.360]   We just assume it.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.380]   But when you recognize who it is
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.140]   that declares his love for us,
[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.780]   that in and of itself should be a source of celebration.
[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:30.460]   That that God who's able to crush us,
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.540]   who is almighty, who is omniscient,
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.120]   he says he loves us.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.180]   That that in and of itself,
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.660]   that that would stop us in our track,
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.540]   and that should cause us to change
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.660]   and to come before him, thanking him every day
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.980]   and worshiping him.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.060]   But he doesn't stop there.
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.220]   That's not where he stops.
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.060]   He actually begins there,
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:55.060]   and then he describes his love in this way.
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.580]   So we talked about who.
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.000]   But he describes the depth of his love
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.920]   by describing to us when he loved us.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.500]   When did he love us?
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.020]   In verse six, while we were yet sinners.
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.660]   Verse eight, while we were weak, in verse six.
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.300]   Verse eight, while we were yet sinners.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.200]   Verse 10, while we were still enemies of God.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.080]   While we were still weak, while we were still sinners,
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.660]   while we were enemies of God.
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.380]   You know the difference between a love relationship
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.420]   while you're dating, in the beginning stages,
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.940]   or later on when you have a good marriage
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.580]   and you've been together for many years?
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.620]   The difference between these two love
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.980]   is one is a because of, right?
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.860]   And anybody who says otherwise, you're lying.
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:43.580]   He's like, no, no, no, I love my girlfriend despite.
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.700]   Liar.
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.960]   Nobody practices despite love in the beginning.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.820]   We all love, it's like, why, why do you like him?
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.060]   Why do you love her?
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.680]   She got long hair.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.180]   Right, that's the kind of girl I like, right?
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.420]   She's quiet, she's loud, she's,
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.020]   that's it, it's this kind of personality.
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.860]   She loves to serve, she loves children.
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.460]   We have all this stuff, because, right?
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.460]   Why do you like him?
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.420]   He's tall, he's handsome, he's worked hard,
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.980]   he's athletic, we have all these reasons.
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.340]   It's because, right?
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.140]   So in the beginning of our relationship,
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.580]   it's, you know, we always talk about,
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.940]   oh, you know, that love, you know,
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.620]   the honeymoon love, when you first met,
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.500]   the first love, you know?
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.460]   And we romanticize that, and thinking,
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.660]   like, I want to go back to that, right?
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.240]   But the problem with that love is
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.220]   it's very weak and superficial, right?
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.500]   And I remember, I know a guy, okay,
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.660]   and again, he's not in this room,
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.060]   so don't turn around and look to see who I'm talking about.
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.700]   I know a guy who broke up with his girlfriend.
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:41.860]   This is a long time ago.
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:42.820]   This is back in high school.
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:43.980]   He broke up with his girlfriend
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.780]   because his girlfriend went swimming.
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:47.860]   We all went swimming together.
[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.340]   She came out of the pool, and he took a picture,
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.660]   and she didn't look good wet.
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.820]   And it just ate him up.
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.980]   It just ate him up, and he just couldn't let it go.
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.980]   And we were all like, what is wrong with you, right?
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.180]   But he just couldn't let it go.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.700]   Just look at the picture, and she's just,
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.220]   you know, her hair is all, you know,
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.680]   it's not her normal, like, you know,
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.080]   the Madonna hair back at the time that they had,
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.340]   and it's like, all of that went flat.
[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:16.620]   And then she came out of the pool,
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.860]   and she was like.
[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:18.980]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.340]   And that's when the picture was captured,
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.500]   and he had that with him.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.060]   He just couldn't let it go.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.340]   And he ended up breaking up with her.
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.460]   We're like, what is wrong with you, right?
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.460]   But that's how superficial that love is.
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.340]   Because we love, at that period of love,
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.180]   we love because, because they're pretty,
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.700]   because they do this, because that,
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.580]   and that's why you love.
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:45.140]   But a love relationship that grows and matures,
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.220]   and is founded upon the covenant of God,
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:51.560]   is despite, despite all the weaknesses,
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.620]   despite all the things that we try so hard to hide.
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.840]   And again, Esther and I have been married for 24 years,
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.780]   and in those 24 years, you know,
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:04.140]   everybody begins by trying to hide your weaknesses, right?
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.940]   So if you're messy, you start out
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.140]   by cleaning up your room, right?
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.780]   And it probably takes about five, six days
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.180]   to realize this guy's not clean, right?
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.860]   Or she's not clean, or whatever.
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.660]   So whatever it is that we're trying to hide,
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:17.580]   we try to hold off.
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.340]   And so some things get revealed in months,
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.220]   some things get revealed in years.
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.260]   But eventually, everything gets revealed.
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.800]   You can't hide from your wife.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.060]   You can't hide from your husband.
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.580]   And if you have a good relationship,
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.500]   eventually it builds into, despite, right?
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.940]   Despite the fact that I know all your weaknesses,
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.420]   and I know all your sins,
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.340]   and I know all the things that you try to hide from me,
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.640]   and all the times that you've disappointed me,
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.840]   all the bad temper, and all the stuff that I've seen.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.740]   Despite that, I love you.
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.580]   And so there's a kind of a security
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.300]   that exists in a love relationship
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.640]   that's gone through all that turmoil,
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.940]   seen all the ugliness, and they're committed.
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.740]   So in the beginning of the relationship,
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.740]   there's a, again, especially when you're dating,
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:04.980]   there's always this anxiousness
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.160]   that if you don't dress properly,
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.640]   if you don't comb your hair right,
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.880]   if you have bad breath,
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.740]   if you go in the water and take a bad picture,
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.860]   that this may end the relationship, right?
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.940]   That's how superficial it is.
[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.300]   A lot of times in our relationship with God,
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:25.100]   we have this kind of security like we're dating God.
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.580]   That if we don't have our things right,
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:29.980]   and if we don't read the Bible enough,
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.900]   that somehow our relationship with God
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.980]   is gonna be severed, and we're always anxious.
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:39.540]   See, God describes this love, He says,
[00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:43.240]   "No, He loved us when we were weak."
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.780]   The word weak in Greek literally means without power.
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.280]   Without power for what?
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.100]   Without power that you had no way
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.020]   of doing anything about your salvation.
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.620]   There's nothing you could have done.
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.720]   In Jeremiah chapter 13, 23, it says,
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.260]   "Can the Ethiopian change his skin
[00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.900]   "or the leopard his spots?
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.540]   "Then you also can do good who are accustomed to do evil."
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.420]   Did you hear what he said?
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.660]   If you're in the habit of doing evil,
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.980]   for you to simply say, "I'm gonna be good now."
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.040]   He said, "That's no different than a leopard saying,
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.140]   "I'm gonna get rid of my spots."
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.220]   In other words, he says, "Impossible."
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.640]   Jeremiah 2, 22, "Though you wash yourself with lye
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.080]   "and use much soap, the stain of your guilt
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.380]   "is still before me, declares the Lord God."
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:31.320]   There's nothing that you could have possibly done.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.060]   He says, "While we were still weak."
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.720]   He didn't look upon us and said,
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.560]   "Who has the most potential?
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.140]   "Who has the kind of hair that I want?
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.520]   "Who has the kind of talent?
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.800]   "Who can keep themselves from whatever it is
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.460]   "that they should keep themselves from?"
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:48.980]   He didn't look at the people with the most potential.
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:50.540]   He didn't look at the prettiest.
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.900]   He didn't look at the fastest.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:57.060]   He said, "Despite, while we were yet weak."
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:57.940]   He loved us.
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.340]   "While we were still sinners."
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.060]   The word sinner, basically, in the Greek word,
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.760]   hamartion, the most basic word that is used for hamartion.
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.680]   Basically, the word hamartion means to fail,
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.320]   to completely miss the mark.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.480]   Again, in Romans 3, 23, he says,
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.560]   "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.320]   You've utterly failed.
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.840]   That God didn't choose us because
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.200]   we were potential A students.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.560]   He said, "While we were rebelling against God."
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.680]   While we had no desire for Him.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.400]   We weren't out seeking Him and saying,
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.060]   "You know what, let's go find people
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.840]   "who are coming to me, and let's go
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.800]   "and get them, help them out."
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.320]   No, he said, "While we were still sinners."
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.440]   While we had no hope.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.480]   And then in verse 10, he says,
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.360]   "While we were enemies of God."
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.320]   Not only were we weak and helpless,
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.480]   not only were we rebelling against Him,
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.400]   but he said, "We were actually enemies of God."
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.160]   In Ephesians 2, 3, "Among whom we all once lived
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.400]   "in passion of our flesh, carrying out the desires
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.400]   "of the body and the mind, and were by nature
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.120]   "children of wrath."
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.600]   By nature.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.280]   We were his enemies.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:08.660]   Years ago, you know, I shared this
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.880]   when Dr. Pang was in the first service,
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.920]   but there's something that I remember him
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.840]   telling me about his testimony that stuck with me
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.720]   for years, and even to this day.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.280]   I remember when he first became a Christian,
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.240]   I was kind of intrigued, because we spent
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.880]   so many years praying for Dr. and Mrs. Pang
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.720]   to come to Christ.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.480]   Some of you guys would know who he is.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.940]   And so I asked him, one day we were having lunch,
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.760]   and I asked Dr. Pang, "Dr. Pang,
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.840]   "so what finally brought you to repentance
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.760]   "and to accept Christ?"
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.760]   And he said, and I remember very specifically,
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.840]   he said, "For 35 years, people have been trying
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.880]   "to get him to come to church,
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.920]   "and he just wasn't interested."
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.520]   And I remember, again, Tanya and Valerie praying for them,
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.360]   and I remember spending so much time talking about,
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.840]   you know, sharing the gospel with them,
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.040]   and then when they finally came to Christ,
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:55.400]   it was kind of like, unbelievable.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.220]   You know what I mean?
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.040]   Even though we've been praying, we believe in a mighty God,
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.360]   but when it happens, like, "Oh, really?"
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.540]   So I asked him, "So what triggered it?"
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.960]   And I remember what he shared with me,
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.760]   it was, you know, it stuck with me,
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.240]   and he said, "The Bible."
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.000]   I said, "What about the Bible?"
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:11.840]   He said, "I started reading the Bible,
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.720]   "and it came to a point where he started to be convinced
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.000]   "that this was written by God and not man."
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.520]   So, I read the Bible every day,
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.720]   I just give the Bible to people then, you know?
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.980]   So he said, "So what about the Bible?
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.580]   "What did you read in the Bible that caused you
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.160]   "to think that this was written by God?"
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.740]   And he said, "Well, there's other stuff,
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.320]   "but the main thing that he pointed out was
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.700]   "when Jesus told his disciples to love your enemies."
[00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.500]   I said, "You know, we hear that all the time.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.720]   "If you've grown up in Sunday school,
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.680]   "you've heard that Bible study lesson all the time."
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.960]   But again, as a person who was outside the church,
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.200]   and when he was reading that for the first time,
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.280]   he said, "This is not a love that human beings practice.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:56.880]   "This has to be from something else."
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.320]   And that changed his perspective,
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.180]   that what is taught in Scripture
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.820]   is beyond human practice and human reason.
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.500]   And then he began to read the Bible
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.820]   from a different perspective,
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.720]   and then that's what he said caused him to come to Christ.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.760]   Again, I thought it was so profound,
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.600]   because being raised in a church myself,
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.440]   I heard that since I was a kid.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.720]   Love your enemies as yourself.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.680]   But if you really think about it,
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.480]   whoever practices that?
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.320]   Nobody, I've never seen it,
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.400]   and even the closest thing that we see
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.560]   about mother's love for their child,
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.240]   even then, we don't see enemies.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.880]   Only God can demand that of his disciples,
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.800]   because that's what he did.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:44.360]   Only God could demand that from his followers,
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.280]   from his children, from his friends,
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.720]   because that's exactly what he was about to do.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.000]   He loved us while we were weak,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.020]   while we were sinners,
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.320]   and while we were still his enemies.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.600]   Imagine how Romans, how Paul describes mankind.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.280]   In Romans chapter three, 10 through 11.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.400]   So I want you, I know you know this passage,
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.840]   but I want you to read this
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.720]   and pay attention to what it says,
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.640]   and then I'm gonna give you an assignment
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.240]   that you're gonna accomplish right here in this room, okay?
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.920]   This is how mankind is described.
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.560]   This is you and me.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.840]   None is righteous, no not one.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.440]   No one understands, no one seeks for God.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:23.520]   All have turned aside.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.940]   Together they have become worthless.
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.520]   No one does good, not even one.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.040]   Their throat is an open grave.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.820]   They use their tongues to deceive.
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.120]   The venom of asps is under their lips.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.640]   Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.440]   Their feet are swift to shed blood.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.360]   In their path are ruin and misery,
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.440]   and the way of peace they have not known.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.520]   There is no fear of God before their eyes.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.760]   Now if we read that and said, you know what,
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.120]   whoever this is a description of,
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.840]   and then I asked you as an assignment,
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.180]   so after verse 18 say, therefore,
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:59.100]   if this is God describing you and me,
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.360]   therefore, what would you expect to come after that?
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:08.780]   Would you expect, therefore, he loved us?
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:10.500]   Is that what you would expect?
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.940]   No, what we would write, if this was an assignment,
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.940]   and you fill in the rest, right?
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.620]   We found the manuscript, we found the book of Romans,
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.660]   but we don't have the next part.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.460]   We only have verse up to 18,
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.420]   and it describes that this is the state of mankind.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.980]   We would say, therefore, what would naturally follow this,
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.140]   therefore, God was angry and burned with his jealousy,
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.980]   and he ruined the world.
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.380]   Therefore, because they were stiff-necked,
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:39.380]   and no one was seeking God,
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.980]   that no matter how much he was patient with them,
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:42.980]   they wouldn't turn.
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:46.820]   Therefore, he brought the flood.
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:47.820]   Therefore he stopped the world.
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.940]   Therefore, every single one was judged
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.500]   according to their sin.
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:52.820]   That's what you and I would expect
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.780]   would come after verse 18.
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:27:01.060]   We wouldn't expect, therefore, he died for us.
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.860]   See but that's exactly how the Bible
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.460]   describes our salvation.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.500]   That at just the right time, he says in verse 6,
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.220]   at just the right time.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.660]   We talk about the just the right time,
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.060]   you know typically we expound on the Romans
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.500]   and Alexander the Great,
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:19.780]   and how he brought the world together.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.740]   There was a road that led to every part of the world
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.620]   at that time.
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.460]   The language was united with Greek,
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.060]   and yeah all of these things definitely contributed
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.460]   physically to getting the Gospel out.
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.940]   And it was the perfect time,
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.220]   politically, financially, culturally.
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.220]   But I believe there's something
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.780]   much more deeper going on
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:42.220]   than this superficial political environment.
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.500]   There's two ways that I think
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.900]   we ought to understand this text
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:48.940]   when he says that he loved us despite, right?
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.220]   Despite the fact that we were weak,
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.620]   despite the fact that we were sinners,
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.820]   despite the fact that we were enemies of God,
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.980]   that at just the right time,
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.980]   just the right time means one,
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.500]   that when we were utterly helpless,
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.220]   when the scripture says that the law came
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:04.900]   to make sin utterly sinful,
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.700]   meaning when we were absolutely helpless,
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.860]   when we've exhausted everything that we had
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.140]   to possibly think that we can save ourselves,
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.180]   and we couldn't.
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.500]   So again, if you've ever read
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.660]   about how lifeguards get trained,
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.540]   they say when somebody is drowning,
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.620]   you wait, right?
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:25.620]   Not until they drown,
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.180]   then it'd be too late, right?
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.700]   But right before.
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:29.700]   They're kicking and screaming,
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.340]   and if you jump in and try to grab them at that time,
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:34.580]   their desire to stay alive,
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.100]   if they're kicking and screaming,
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:38.020]   they're going to bring you down too.
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.420]   So the way that they're trained is,
[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.980]   you wait until they've exhausted their energy,
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.260]   and they look like they're going to pass out.
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.740]   And just at the right time,
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.420]   when they're absolutely helpless,
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.140]   and they have no strength to fight,
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.140]   you jump in and you drag a limp body
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.140]   who's breathing,
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.460]   and you drag them out of the water.
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.220]   That's how they're trained.
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.260]   When Paul says, "at just the right time,"
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.460]   he's talking about the nation of Israel,
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.460]   mankind,
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.620]   who has absolutely exhausted everything
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.740]   that they had in their resources,
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.340]   and they throw up their hands and say,
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:07.340]   "This is it!
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.100]   There's no more!
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.380]   There's nothing that I could do!"
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:13.960]   It's kind of like, you know,
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.900]   when you get this glow stick when you're young,
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:16.900]   you know what I mean?
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.820]   You get it at Disneyland, I think, right?
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:19.820]   And then you go home,
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:20.820]   when you're a little kid,
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.820]   you want to see,
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:22.820]   and so you go into the closet
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.060]   and you turn off all the lights, right?
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.060]   You turn off all the lights
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.060]   because you don't see it well.
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.060]   When you turn the lights on,
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.060]   you take that out,
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:30.060]   it's like, "Whoa!
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.060]   Look at this!"
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.060]   Because it's much better, right?
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.500]   Just like even when you want to go see the star,
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.660]   you have to go where there's no lights,
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:36.660]   no distraction,
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.860]   and the stars seem that much brighter.
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:39.860]   So when the scripture says,
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.220]   "at just the right time,"
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.660]   he demonstrated his love toward us,
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.440]   is that when we were absolutely helpless,
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.960]   when we were seeped in our sin,
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.240]   when we had no thought of God,
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:55.120]   when we were in our sins as darkest as dark could be,
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.760]   that's when he stepped in.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.920]   And that was the right time.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.920]   Not only was it the right time
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.240]   because we were absolutely helpless,
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.840]   it was the right time because it was God-ordained.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.720]   Meaning this was not some plan B,
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.560]   that he tried everything and nothing worked,
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.800]   so therefore let's try this now.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.140]   He said, "No, just the right time,"
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.540]   that he's been waiting for this appointed time,
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.340]   just like it says in Ephesians 1 through 5,
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.860]   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.180]   who has blessed us in Christ
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:27.500]   with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:28.740]   Even as he chose us in him
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.940]   before the foundation of the world,
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.580]   that we should be holy and blameless before him in love,
[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:36.620]   he predestined us for adoption through Jesus Christ
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.820]   according to the purpose of his will."
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:41.220]   So if you read Ephesians chapter 1,
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:42.220]   over and over again it says,
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.220]   "He was according to his purpose,"
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.620]   "It was according to his will,"
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:46.420]   "It was according to his desire,"
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:47.420]   "He was predestined,"
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.420]   "He predestined us,"
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.420]   "He elected us,"
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.740]   "And this is according to his purpose,"
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.540]   over and over again,
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:57.140]   that this was God's plan from the beginning,
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.760]   before the foundation of the world.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.300]   And he's been waiting for an opportune time
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.540]   when we were absolutely helpless,
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.860]   so that when he came,
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:12.120]   that we would recognize him as our Savior.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:16.060]   How does this affect us?
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.980]   Why does he tell us this in the context
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.900]   of him talking about justification by faith,
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.600]   and joy and hope?
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.820]   And what is the point of telling us
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:27.460]   that he loves us in this way?
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.140]   Absolute security.
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.480]   Absolute security.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.100]   That if he was mindful of us
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.700]   while we were rebelling,
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.980]   everything that we try so hard to hide from him
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.180]   and hide from other people,
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.480]   that we're so afraid to be exposed.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.720]   Even this morning,
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.320]   you guys are doing a great job.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.880]   Because when I look at this audience,
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.840]   I see a lot of good Christians.
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.840]   You know, you brought your Bibles,
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:54.840]   most of them,
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:55.840]   most of you, you know.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.340]   If not, you have your phone.
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:31:59.540]   Most of you have dressed nice,
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:00.540]   most of you.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.760]   Combed your hair, took a shower,
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.240]   you know, nobody is flipping through a magazine right now,
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.320]   at least I can't see it, right?
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.320]   You're all paying attention,
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.320]   you know,
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.320]   nobody is cussing your head out.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.520]   I don't see a single drunk person here.
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.460]   You know, we're all doing a great job, right?
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.040]   But every single one of us,
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:24.280]   there's sins that we are trying very hard
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.740]   not to be exposed.
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.320]   It may be even last night.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.580]   It may be even this morning.
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.040]   And you come into this room,
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.040]   and you're doing your best.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.520]   And it's not that you want to be a hypocrite,
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.800]   it's just there's things that you're wrestling with.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.000]   And we do a great job when we're at church.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.520]   But there's a sense of guilt,
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.840]   like, is God going to love me?
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.320]   Will God answer my prayers?
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.760]   Does this affect my salvation?
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.760]   We won't admit it,
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.880]   but there's some insecurity in your heart
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.960]   because of the things that you are guilty of.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.360]   See, what this reminds us of,
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.400]   is that He didn't go around and say,
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.400]   "You know what?
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.640]   I have hope for you,
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.200]   because if I pour my love into you,
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.200]   I think, you know,
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.840]   I see potential in you."
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.700]   And He basically took people who have potential,
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:11.400]   and decided to love us.
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:16.040]   No, He said, "Despite your weakness."
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.520]   Because He knew we had no other way of salvation,
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.920]   but by His grace.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.760]   While we were yet sinners,
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.000]   He knew that we wouldn't turn around
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.960]   and make Him our Lord by our own will.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.240]   So He came and got us.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.120]   While we were yet enemies,
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.480]   while we were blaspheming His name
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.040]   and shaking our fists at Him,
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.080]   He knew we would never change team,
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:42.280]   because the world is too attractive.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.760]   And so, instead of judging us,
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.560]   He decided the only way that you and I
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.080]   would ever have any hope,
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:51.640]   is if He decided to practice agape love with us.
[00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:55.800]   Despite all of that, He came to us.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:59.080]   That alone should cause us to say,
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:02.760]   "God of this universe decided to love me,
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.720]   the omnipotent, omniscient God.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.080]   And He loved me despite all the things
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.760]   that I'm trying so hard to hide from other people."
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.920]   But it doesn't stop there.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.440]   The real punchline, the crescendo of His love,
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:19.160]   isn't the fact who He is,
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.160]   even though that in and of itself
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.360]   should stop us at our tracks.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.120]   The fact that He loved us despite who we were,
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.680]   that in and of itself should stop us at its tracks.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.640]   But the real punchline in this is the third part,
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.360]   is how He loved us.
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.600]   See, each one of these things He says,
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.240]   "Therefore He loved us," in verse 6,
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.440]   "while we were still weak at the right time,
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.600]   Christ died for the ungodly."
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.920]   Verse 8, "But God demonstrates His own love toward us,
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:51.160]   while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.360]   Verse 10, "For if while we were enemies,
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.280]   we were reconciled by God by the death of His Son."
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.760]   Each one of these statements, He said,
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.040]   not only did He love us despite the fact,
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.320]   He said He loved us to the point of death.
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:07.160]   He would send the most precious thing that He has,
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.560]   and offer it up to us.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.400]   So in Romans 5, verse 8, it says,
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:15.280]   "God demonstrates, He reveals His love toward us,
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.760]   in that while we were yet sinners,
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:21.160]   Christ died for us."
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.480]   See, He qualifies that, before that, in verse 7,
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:28.480]   He said, "For one would scarcely die for a righteous person,
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.320]   though for perhaps a good person,
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.040]   one would dare even to die."
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.880]   In other words, what Paul is saying,
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:38.440]   and what the Holy Spirit is telling us this morning,
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:42.160]   is that in human practice, and what you and I understand,
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:45.040]   that every once in a while, you may hear of a hero
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:49.200]   who jumps on a grenade to save his friends.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.200]   And the world celebrates.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.440]   Like, he gets a Purple Heart, and the family gets compensation.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:57.840]   They get honored, because it is that rare.
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.600]   To die for somebody, for rarely, maybe,
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.520]   maybe if somebody really deserved it,
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.680]   these are my friends, and I would take a bullet,
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:10.040]   I would die for them, and he actually does it.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:12.040]   The most human response is not that.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.040]   "Oh, grenade!"
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.960]   Maybe grab somebody else to protect you.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:17.960]   Instinctively.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.360]   You didn't think this through.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:22.160]   Just instinctively, that's what you may do.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.200]   So the fact that this guy went toward it,
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.840]   is like, "Oh my gosh, this guy is going to…
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.240]   we're going to build a monument for him.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.480]   We're going to remember him forever."
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.080]   He said, "Maybe, every once in a while,
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.000]   you may see that kind of love,
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.040]   that they would sacrifice for their friend.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:42.520]   But to sacrifice for an enemy?
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:47.880]   You throw a bomb, and you're captured in an Al-Qaeda prison,
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.000]   and a bomb gets thrown in there?
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.320]   You don't jump toward that."
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:55.040]   You guys are like, "Yes!
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.000]   Take some of these suckers out with me."
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Right?
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   When's the last time you heard somebody jumped on a bomb
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.760]   to protect his captors?
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.200]   So that's what he's saying in verse 8.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.360]   Possibly, that the closest that you and I could possibly imagine
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.800]   the depth of love, the greatest of love,
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.680]   that you and I could possibly even imagine,
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:19.880]   and write scripts and movies, poems about,
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.160]   is possibly every once in a while,
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.600]   somebody would be brave enough, honorable enough,
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.120]   to die for somebody who was righteous,
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:31.000]   but Christ died for the unrighteous.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   While we were helpless.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.320]   While we were sinners.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.440]   While we were enemies of God.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.960]   And that's why, he's John 3, 16, it says,
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:44.080]   "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son."
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.160]   You know the word "so" here, isn't like,
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.040]   "God so loved the world."
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:52.440]   The word "so" basically means "demonstrates."
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:56.120]   This is the means in which he loved.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:00.360]   God demonstrates his love toward us,
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.400]   by sending his only begotten Son.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:07.160]   So in other words, what is he saying?
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:12.360]   Justification by faith is an expression of his love.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.000]   It is not just a legal standing.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.440]   It is not just, "We're going to erase your sins."
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.440]   It's an expression.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.980]   It's a glorification of his love.
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:24.680]   When he said, "It's time for you to glorify your Son,
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.040]   that I may glorify you."
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.860]   What was he glorifying?
[00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:29.600]   To glorify something is to put it on pedestal,
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.000]   so everybody can see.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.920]   And what is the greatest thing that you'd want to see?
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.600]   It's love.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.760]   And it is not just any love.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.600]   It is the greatest love.
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.340]   It is the love that you and I could not possibly imagine.
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.480]   You wouldn't be able to be creative enough
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.040]   to write a script, a Hollywood movie,
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.920]   to write a script that way.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.680]   And he said, "It's that love that was put on a pedestal
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.520]   on the cross, so that you and I can see this love
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.880]   and be affected."
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.560]   And that's why Paul says, "I am compelled
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:02.040]   by the love of Christ."
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.360]   When we saw the glory of Christ,
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:09.400]   we saw his love manifested on Christ.
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.760]   And that's what changed us.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.560]   And that's what continues to change us.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.920]   As you guys know, we're in political season,
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:21.720]   and Donald Trump is quoted almost every other day,
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:25.000]   especially when he quotes the Bible.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.480]   He quoted two Corinthians something,
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.960]   and he's like, "I read my Bible every day,
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.360]   especially two Corinthians."
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.640]   (audience laughs)
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:37.960]   Recently he talked about how he said,
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.920]   "I practice the Bible.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.760]   Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.320]   You mess with me, I mess with you."
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.920]   So basically he was warning everybody
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.200]   who's cutting him down, he's like,
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.960]   "I'm going to remember you.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:50.960]   This is biblical.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.480]   Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth."
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.440]   And obviously all the theologians jumped at him.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.480]   He's like, "That's novel, that text."
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:01.400]   The purpose of that text is actually for restraint.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.960]   God was trying to restrain Israel
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:07.680]   because our natural tendency is that if you hurt me,
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:12.080]   I will hurt you and your brother.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.320]   You slap me and you poke me in the eye,
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.040]   I take both your eyes.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:21.480]   You smash my car in, I smash your car and your house.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.480]   Don't mess with me.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.320]   Because that's our natural tendency.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.400]   We don't have to tell you that.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.680]   That's our natural tendency, is vengeance.
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.200]   So what God was restricting them of is vengeance,
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.260]   because God knows our natural tendency
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:37.340]   is to seek vengeance.
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:40.320]   And that was to restrain Israel,
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.120]   restrain God's people.
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:47.040]   But the next form is justice.
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.120]   Justice is basically getting what you deserve.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.960]   And we demand -- if we don't have justice,
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.360]   I mean, riots will break out, right?
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.760]   Justice!
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.420]   We were falsely accused, and we demand --
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:00.800]   if somebody does something wrong to us,
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.960]   and the police doesn't come and punish the other person,
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:03.960]   justice.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:08.440]   We demand justice.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:11.060]   Imagine if God took vengeance on us.
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.880]   You and I would not be here.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:18.720]   Imagine if God practiced justice with us.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:19.720]   We would be crushed.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.520]   I mean, think about North Korea.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.880]   I mean, you go into that nation, and you say,
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.360]   "I think Kim Jong-un is a little overweight."
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.360]   Prison.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.360]   Right?
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:34.120]   Because in that nation, that's justice.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.120]   What are you going to do about it?
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.120]   Right?
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.120]   He's a dictator.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.120]   You're in their country.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.120]   Right?
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.120]   What are you going to do about it?
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:43.180]   If they chose to practice whatever justice
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.760]   they think is right.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.200]   Imagine if God of the universe practiced justice with us,
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.680]   and what He thought was fair.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:54.080]   You and I wouldn't be here.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.520]   You wouldn't even understand what I'm saying.
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.120]   You'd be like, "Oh, this babbling."
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.120]   You know?
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.120]   "Why doesn't Kim Jong-un just stop?"
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.120]   Right?
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.120]   I say, "Inside joke."
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.120]   Right?
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.120]   Why?
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.120]   Why?
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.120]   Why?
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.120]   You know, you're not going to --
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.120]   The fact that you even understand what I'm saying
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.120]   is because God had mercy.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:14.120]   See, mercy is the next stage.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.120]   It's withholding what you deserve.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.120]   You deserve the wrath.
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.120]   You and I deserve the wrath.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.120]   But God said, "You know what?
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.120]   I'm going to show mercy.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.120]   I pardon you."
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.120]   Right?
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.120]   "I'm not going to put you in prison.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:26.120]   I'm not going to kill you now."
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.120]   So, the whole world is under the mercy of God.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.120]   Right?
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.120]   Right now.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.120]   Because we're all experiencing common grace.
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:36.120]   Because there's enough oxygen for all of us.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.120]   Everybody experiences some level of love.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.120]   That the world is not blown up.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.120]   That we are able to live and enjoy life
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:43.120]   to a certain degree.
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:47.120]   So, we're all experiencing a level of mercy.
[00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.120]   See, but justification by faith
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:51.120]   is not vengeance.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.120]   It's not justice.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:54.120]   And it goes even beyond mercy.
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.120]   It's grace.
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:00.120]   Grace is receiving what you don't deserve.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:03.120]   It's somebody who slaps you on the face
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:06.120]   and you go back
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.120]   and you buy him a nice meal.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.120]   Right?
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.120]   Somebody who wronged you
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:14.120]   and then you choose to love that person
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.120]   for their sake.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.120]   See, that's grace.
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:21.120]   And that's what He's trying to reveal to us.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:25.120]   That the love that is compelling Paul,
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.120]   that even in the context of being beaten,
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.120]   even in the context of possibly losing his life,
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:33.120]   what motivates this man
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.120]   to preach the Gospel in the midst of suffering,
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:38.120]   to rejoice,
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:41.120]   he says, "The love of Christ."
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:47.120]   When a man or a woman is gripped by the love of Christ,
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:50.120]   love makes us do weird things.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.120]   And some of you guys remember
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:54.120]   when you first fell in love,
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.120]   the amount of driving you did.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.120]   Some of you guys were penny pinchers.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.120]   All of a sudden you became very generous.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.120]   And you remember.
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.120]   Some of you guys don't take a shower every day.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.120]   You were taking a shower every day.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:10.120]   A lot of things that you did that was very strange.
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:13.120]   I see it.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.120]   I'm not going to mention specific things.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:16.120]   I've seen it.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.120]   I've known a lot of you guys for a long time.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.120]   I've seen some stuff.
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:23.120]   Like you were a different person for a period.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:26.120]   Your hair was different.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.120]   Love makes us do things that you wouldn't normally do.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.120]   It makes you beside yourself.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.120]   It gives you energy that you didn't have before.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:36.120]   Even in the context of misery at work,
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.120]   you have a smile on your face.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:41.120]   That's what love does.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.120]   And that's what Paul says.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.120]   Our Christian life ultimately
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.120]   is about loving our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.120]   with all our heart, soul, mind and strength.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.120]   Why?
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:53.120]   Because He first loved us.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:56.120]   Because He loved us.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:45:02.120]   And we are consumed by this love.
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:05.120]   Think about every time.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.120]   Every time you disappointed God.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.120]   Think about every time you told God,
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:13.120]   "I'm not going to do it anymore."
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.120]   Think about all those nook and crannies
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.120]   in your private lives
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:22.120]   that you've done so well to hide from other people.
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:26.120]   That God knows all of them.
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:29.120]   Not only in the past, He knows tomorrow.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:32.120]   He knows even today.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.120]   Knowing all of that, He didn't say,
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.120]   "Therefore, I'm going to judge you."
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.120]   He said, "Therefore, the only way I can save you
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.120]   is by stepping off of my throne
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.120]   and being equal with God."
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.120]   Did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.120]   but He humbled Himself and became nothing.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.120]   He walked among us,
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.120]   so that He can be a sympathetic High Priest.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:53.120]   And so that we can be drawn to Him,
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.120]   to the throne of grace.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.120]   That we can enter with confidence.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.120]   And His ultimate exclamation mark is,
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.120]   He died on the cross, and He says,
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:04.120]   "Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy laden,
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:07.120]   and I will give you rest."
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.120]   How many of you are struggling
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:12.120]   because you see your relationship with God
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:15.120]   as a dating relationship?
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:19.120]   That you're afraid that if you don't put your best,
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.120]   that somehow something's going to happen?
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:24.120]   That maybe you don't pray
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.120]   because you think that God's going to stop,
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.120]   God stopped answering your prayers
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.120]   because you weren't good enough?
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:37.120]   Justification by faith is a firm reminder.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.120]   He loved us despite.
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.120]   He loved us while we were weak,
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.120]   while we were sinners, while we were enemies.
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:47.120]   So therefore, by the blood of Christ,
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:52.120]   come. Come to Jesus. Come to Jesus.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:54.120]   Would you take a minute to pray with me?
