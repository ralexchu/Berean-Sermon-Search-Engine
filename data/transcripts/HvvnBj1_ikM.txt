[00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.520]   Dear Lord, we thank you for bringing us here tonight
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.020]   from wherever we're coming from,
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:07.520]   whether it be work or school or wherever we may be coming
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.520]   from, we thank you that we have the privilege
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:14.020]   of coming here, gathering, to sing worship to you,
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.520]   to hear your word and to just have fellowship
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.020]   with one another.
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.520]   I pray again, God, for strength as we may be tired
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.520]   from a long day, to be focused and that our minds
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.520]   would be attentive and that we would come just hungry
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.520]   to learn from your word and to just have a good time
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.020]   of just fellowship and worship and that you would be honored
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.520]   and glorified in this time.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.520]   I pray that as we go into a time of just singing these songs
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.020]   that you allow us to reflect on the lyrics that we sing
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.020]   to you, that it would be a pleasing aroma to you.
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.520]   We thank you again, God, in your name we pray, amen.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.520]   Can we all stand for a time of praise?

[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.600]   Good evening.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.600]   Let me pray for us.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:07.600]   And then we'll get the Bible study started.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:13.600]   Lord, we are very thankful
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.600]   just that you provide for us
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:20.600]   the freedom and the means to get together tonight
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.600]   and the resources that are available to us
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.600]   to dive deeply into your word.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.600]   And I pray especially, Lord God,
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.600]   for those of us who've really longed
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.600]   to meet you through your word.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.600]   I pray, Father, that you would minister
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:42.600]   thoroughly in and through us today.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.600]   And Father, I pray, Lord God,
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.600]   as I'm sure there are those of us in here
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.600]   who, because of distraction and laziness,
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.600]   are feeling guilty because we haven't prepared,
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.600]   I pray, Father, that you would help us
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.600]   to long for your word
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.600]   and to remove the distractions that hinder us
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.600]   from having an appetite for your word.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.600]   And I pray that as we discuss, as we share,
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.600]   that you really would be honored
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.600]   and that you would transform our thoughts,
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.600]   renew our minds,
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.600]   and cause us to leave here more like Christ.
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.600]   So we pray that you would guide this time.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.600]   I pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:29.600]   So I'm gonna, just because we weren't here last week,
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.600]   our text today, the five verses,
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.600]   are surrounded by very sensitive passages
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:40.600]   that are very humanly offensive and demeaning
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.600]   if we just take it for what it says.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.600]   So I'm gonna read, basically,
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.600]   what we're reading today is the why
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.600]   we're supposed to be submissive
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.600]   to the human institutions that are in our lives.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.600]   So verse 18 of chapter two,
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.600]   and I'll just read one verse of next week's passage.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:04.600]   "Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect,
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.600]   "not only to those who are good and gentle,
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.600]   "but also to those who are unreasonable.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.600]   "For this finds favor,
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.600]   "if for the sake of conscience toward God,
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:17.600]   "a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.600]   "For what credit is there if when you sin
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.600]   "and are harshly treated, you endure with patience?
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.600]   "But if when you do what is right and suffer for it,
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.600]   "you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.600]   "For you have been called for this purpose
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.600]   "since Christ also suffered for you,
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:41.600]   "leaving you an example for you to follow in his steps,
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:45.600]   "who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in his mouth,
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.600]   "and while being reviled, he did not revile in return.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.600]   "While suffering, he uttered no threats,
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.600]   "but kept entrusting himself to him who judges righteously.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.600]   "And he himself bore our sins in his body on the cross
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.600]   "so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness,
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.600]   "for by his wounds you were healed.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.600]   "For you were continually straying like sheep,
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.600]   "but now you have returned to the shepherd
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.600]   "and guardian of your souls,
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:18.600]   "in the same way you wives be submissive
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.600]   "to your own husbands, so that even if any of them
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.600]   "are disobedient to the word,
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.600]   "they will be won without a word
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.600]   "by the behavior of their wives."
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.600]   So that's the passage for today.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:34.600]   The first part of this, as you guys are very familiar
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.600]   with this by now, it's just a review
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.600]   of what you guys prepared for the five verses.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.600]   You guys know that this time is not for us to learn,
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.600]   it's for us to share what we've learned at home.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.600]   So you're gonna share the stuff that you prepared
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.600]   at home, those five verses, and then at the end,
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.600]   if you have a little bit of time,
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.600]   you're gonna be talking about just the reality
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.600]   of when this happens to us.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.600]   When are you reviled?
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.600]   When do you want to return evil for evil?
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.600]   And then how do we die to those desires
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.600]   that are in our flesh?
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.600]   So take some time to do that.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.600]   And at 8.20, we'll come back and do our wrap-up.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.600]   All right?

[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:37.600]   And this is our identity in Christ, okay?
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:40.600]   It says, "But you are a chosen race,

[01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:56.600]   "into his marvelous light."
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:59.600]   What a beautiful, nice verse, right?
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:05.600]   How do you proclaim his excellencies?
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:10.600]   What is that?
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:15.600]   In a hostile environment,
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:21.600]   in a time where the Christian faith is hated,
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:25.600]   how do you proclaim the excellencies of him
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:28.600]   who called you out of darkness and into his marvelous light?
[01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:31.600]   The word call is very important.
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:32.600]   He's called us this.
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:35.600]   He's called us out of darkness, right?
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:39.600]   And our jobs, proclaim his excellencies.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:42.600]   So how does a Christian go about doing this?
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:46.600]   Do we go shout it from the rooftops?
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:48.600]   Do we like badger people?
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:52.600]   That's important.
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:54.600]   And then verse 11 and 12, talking about
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:56.600]   living good lives among the Gentiles.
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:31:00.600]   Verse 13 talks about being subject, right?
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:04.600]   To every human institution, being subject to the king,
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:08.600]   to governors he sent, to bad masters.
[01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:10.600]   And then next week we're gonna be looking at
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:12.600]   husbands who are unbelieving,
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:17.600]   wives implied who are a little bit difficult to live with.
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:20.600]   How do we proclaim the excellencies?
[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:25.600]   And that's why today's passage is important.
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:29.600]   Because we're not fighting fire with fire.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:30.600]   Okay?
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:33.600]   Proclaiming the excellencies of Christ
[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:34.600]   who has called us out of darkness
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:36.600]   into his wonderful light,
[01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:40.600]   that's not just shouting it at people.
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:45.600]   There's a lot of suffering
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.600]   and submitting to that suffering
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:51.600]   and not retaliating that's involved in this.
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:54.600]   And so today, verse 21 to 25 is kind of the why.
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.600]   Right?
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:00.600]   The commands are surrounding this passage,
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:03.600]   but this is kind of the example
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:04.600]   that we're gonna be looking at.
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:05.600]   So,
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:11.600]   I added chapter two, verse 15,
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:14.600]   and then I added chapter three, verse eight to nine,
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:17.600]   'cause those are all contextually significant.
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:19.600]   So this was today's passage,
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:22.600]   but before this section,
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:24.600]   I'm just gonna read verse 15 of chapter two.
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:26.600]   "For such is the will of God
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:27.600]   "that by doing right,
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:29.600]   "you may silence the ignorance of foolish men."
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:31.600]   And then chapter three, verse eight,
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:33.600]   "To sum up, all of you be harmonious,
[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:35.600]   "empathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, humble in spirit,
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:37.600]   "not returning evil for evil or insult for insult,
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:38.600]   "but giving a blessing instead."
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:40.600]   So similar to today's.
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:43.600]   "For you were called for the very purpose
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.600]   "that you might inherit a blessing."
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:50.600]   The word call is pretty frequently used
[01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:52.600]   in the book of Peter.
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:53.600]   Okay?
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.600]   You see it three times, I think, just in this.
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:56.600]   Okay?
[01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:58.600]   So the red bull, the first thing I did was,
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:01.600]   those are the important words for me.
[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:04.600]   The yellow highlight, it's kind of the,
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:06.600]   what I call God's call on the Christian.
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:09.600]   I hear Christians today asking, like,
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:11.600]   "I wanna know what God's calling is for my life."
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:12.600]   Suffer!
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:15.600]   Like, but that, ye, right?
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:18.600]   You wanna know what God's will is for your life?
[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:19.600]   Do right.
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:22.600]   Okay, so we're gonna be looking at this today.
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:26.600]   The underlying part is the stuff that has been done
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:28.600]   to the Christian, and the blue bull
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:31.600]   is the example that Christ has set.
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:33.600]   And so this is, just for me,
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:37.600]   a visual organization of this passage.
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:41.600]   Now, if you guys have noticed,
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:45.600]   Isaiah 53 is pretty much everything that's quoted in here.
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:48.600]   Raise, nod your heads if you actually noticed that, yeah.
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:50.600]   It's Isaiah 53.
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:55.600]   And the, follow the example,
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:00.600]   chupahgramon, it literally means to trace,
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:02.600]   and that's why you have that little thing there.
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:04.600]   So this is what you're supposed to do.
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:09.600]   This is gonna be the outline, and you trace it.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:12.600]   This is the pattern you're supposed to follow.
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:15.600]   Christ left you this pattern,
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:17.600]   so start getting used to this,
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:19.600]   because your call to this,
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.600]   this is your purpose, you're gonna follow it.
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:24.600]   You're gonna live like Christ is his will for your life.
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:29.600]   Okay, so Isaiah 53 is used,
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:32.600]   but not in the order of Isaiah 53,
[01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:35.600]   but it's in the kind of Jesus' road to the cross.
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:37.600]   So the first little column,
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:40.600]   I put the example that's been set,
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:42.600]   or the steps, or the condition,
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.600]   and then the quote in 1 Peter,
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:48.600]   and then the part of Isaiah that's being quoted.
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:50.600]   So the first part that we looked at today,
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:52.600]   Christ committed no sin,
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:54.600]   no deceit was found in his mouth.
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:58.600]   Christ did not insult or threaten in return.
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:02.600]   Those are things that we can kind of mimic.
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:04.600]   True or false?
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.600]   Yeah, okay.
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:08.600]   Christ bore our sins on the tree,
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:10.600]   now we can't mimic anymore.
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:13.600]   Okay, but that's mentioned.
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.600]   Why is that mentioned in there?
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:17.600]   It starts out with, we're supposed to follow his example,
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:20.600]   and then there's some things that we can't follow.
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:22.600]   Okay?
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:25.600]   By Christ's wounds we were healed.
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:30.600]   Can I suffer for my non-Christian friend
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:32.600]   and save him?
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:34.600]   That's not mimicable.
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:37.600]   And then the last section of today's passage
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:39.600]   is we were straying like sheep,
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:40.600]   and you know, Isaiah 53, 6,
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:42.600]   that's one of the most memorized passages.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:43.600]   Like, we all like sheep have gone astray,
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:44.600]   each of us to our own way,
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.600]   but he has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:48.600]   So this is all Isaiah 53.
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:51.600]   And Isaiah 53 is famous for what?
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:53.600]   The suffering servant.
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:56.600]   So this is kind of the outline Peter is using
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:00.600]   as our example that we're supposed to follow.
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:03.600]   Is it high calling or low calling?
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:05.600]   In some ways it's kind of a glorious calling,
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:09.600]   but a pretty daunting and sucky one, right?
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:15.600]   So here is what you and I
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:18.600]   are called to do.
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:21.600]   How many of you guys have ever asked this question,
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:23.600]   what am I called to do?
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.600]   Raise your hands if you, yeah.
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:29.600]   So in 2009, my wife and I were in China.
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:32.600]   We were supposed to be there for one year,
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:35.600]   and we were wrestling with should we extend our stay,
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:39.600]   because one year is too short, okay?
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:42.600]   For any kind of effective ministry.
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:46.600]   And so we were really wrestling,
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:49.600]   and then the thought that dawned on me was,
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:50.600]   the whole time I'm praying,
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:52.600]   God, are you calling me to China?
[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:54.600]   Are you calling me to China?
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:56.600]   Is what I was praying.
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.600]   And then the thought that dawned on me was,
[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:01.600]   how about I should, maybe I should pray for the,
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:03.600]   are you calling me to America?
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:07.600]   So I would actually share that with people.
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:09.600]   Like they would ask me, oh, do you feel called to China?
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:12.600]   Then I would say, do you feel called to America?
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:14.600]   No, the command is to go.
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:17.600]   I should feel called to stay put.
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:20.600]   So I'm wrestling with this, this word call.
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:23.600]   Am I called to be a pastor?
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:25.600]   Is another thing I wrestled with.
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:28.600]   And those are things that are a little more tricky to discern,
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:31.600]   but there are explicit calls in scripture
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.600]   that are very easy to discern
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:38.600]   that is a call for you, a command for you.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.600]   So let me rephrase it.
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:43.600]   This is God's will for your life.
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:45.600]   All right, you guys ready for this?
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:47.600]   This is God's will for your life,
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:49.600]   what we're gonna be looking at.
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:51.600]   All right, enjoy.
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:54.600]   So, chapter one, verse 15,
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:58.600]   talks about us being called to be holy.
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.600]   You guys, we remember that, right?
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:03.600]   Chapter two, nine,
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.600]   we're called for the purpose of proclaiming light,
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:07.600]   or we're proclaiming, sorry,
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:11.600]   proclaiming the excellencies of God who saved us.
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.600]   Another call in 1 Peter is
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:18.600]   not returning insult for insult,
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:20.600]   but giving you a blessing.
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:22.600]   That's your call.
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:26.600]   Chapter five, verse 10, to his eternal glory.
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:29.600]   So the word call, the word will of God,
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:31.600]   the word purpose for your life,
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:34.600]   it shows up a lot.
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:36.600]   And it's all related to doing stuff
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:38.600]   that is extremely uncomfortable,
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:40.600]   unnatural,
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:43.600]   and very painful, perhaps.
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:45.600]   You guys following that?
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.600]   Okay.
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.600]   Is this a suggestion for the Christian,
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:52.600]   or is this a non-negotiable?
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:56.600]   It's a non-negotiable.
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:58.600]   Now, obviously, we don't wanna take that to the extreme,
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:38:59.600]   'cause when we're looking at wives
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:01.600]   being subject to the husbands,
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:02.600]   because people have applied this,
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:04.600]   well, that means if I'm in an abusive relationship,
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:06.600]   I need to stay.
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:09.600]   No, that's not exactly the proper application.
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:10.600]   Okay?
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:12.600]   So there are other aspects to that,
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:14.600]   but we need to understand that the call
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.600]   is to subject ourselves,
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:19.600]   even at the risk of harm.
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:21.600]   That much is clear, right?
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.600]   To subject ourselves,
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:27.600]   to submit ourselves to human institutions,
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:29.600]   even at the risk of harm,
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:31.600]   if it means the glory of God.
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:34.600]   Najerds, if you're following that thought.
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:35.600]   Okay?
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:37.600]   I'm not veering from our text.
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:38.600]   Okay?
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:44.600]   A thing that I found that was very interesting
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:46.600]   was this.
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:48.600]   He kept entrusting himself.
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:51.600]   So this is what Jesus did.
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.600]   When he was suffering,
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:58.600]   he paradidu, right?
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:00.600]   He handed himself over.
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.600]   He delivered himself.
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:05.600]   He committed himself to the safekeeping of God,
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:07.600]   who will sort it all out in righteousness.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:10.600]   Okay?
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:12.600]   And the main verbs in this,
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:14.600]   they're all in the imperfect tense.
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:17.600]   So this spirit of non-retaliation,
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:18.600]   this meekness,
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:21.600]   this never returning insult for insult,
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:22.600]   reviling for reviling,
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:23.600]   slander for slander,
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:26.600]   that was characteristic of Jesus' life.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:31.600]   Now here was a thought that I had.
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:35.600]   I actually, when I was meditating on this,
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:37.600]   it's like, who am I tempted to revile?
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:41.600]   I've never been tempted to revile Joe Biden.
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:45.600]   Despite the gas prices.
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:49.600]   I actually, I don't.
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:51.600]   I don't like him.
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:54.600]   But I've never felt the need to slander him
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:57.600]   or revile him or make him the devil.
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:03.600]   I've never once felt tempted to revile Donald Trump,
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:06.600]   even though his character is not, like,
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:09.600]   beautiful.
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:14.600]   Nor have I ever been threatened to revile
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:18.600]   Governor Newsom.
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:24.600]   Nor have I ever felt, like, really disturbed
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:27.600]   by any employer that I had outside of the church.
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:31.600]   I mean, I've had people in relationships
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:35.600]   that have been challenging,
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:38.600]   but I've never felt the need to, like, repay evil.
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:42.600]   You guys follow that?
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:48.600]   You know who I would be just tempted to revile?
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:52.600]   Are the relationships that are in my life
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:56.600]   that mean something to me?
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:59.600]   Or there is investment there,
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:04.600]   and I feel betrayed, I feel wronged,
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:09.600]   I feel injured and harmed and directly sinned against.
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:15.600]   Or, when a lie is told about me.
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:19.600]   I was in Tanzania, taking 20-something people
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:24.600]   to Tanzania, and in Korea, if you're a professor here,
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:26.600]   like, this is no offense, but in Korea,
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:28.600]   professors are not good people.
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:33.600]   And the professor that I was taking on a trip,
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:35.600]   for some reason, he got separated from his wife
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:37.600]   when we were transferring our plane
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:39.600]   from one city in Tanzania to the other,
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:44.600]   so he accused me in anger that I did that on purpose to him.
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:46.600]   I'm like, I have nothing to say.
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:51.600]   And I was so angry, right?
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:54.600]   I wanted to switch his seats on purpose if I could.
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:59.600]   I was so angry, simply because he lied about me,
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:01.600]   something I didn't do.
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:05.600]   Another situation where I'd be tempted to revile
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:09.600]   is if someone I poured into does me great injury.
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:12.600]   That's when I want to revile, that's when I want to slander,
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:14.600]   that's when I want to injure.
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:21.600]   So if this person injures me deeply, I want to injure back.
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:31.600]   Not Joe Biden, not Newsom, perhaps it could be my wife
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:34.600]   who causes me really deep injury,
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:41.600]   or my father, or my mom, or that uncle,
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:44.600]   or this boss who takes advantage of me.
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:48.600]   Are you guys tracking along?
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:51.600]   Usually it's not the government institutions,
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:53.600]   unless they do something grievous to you.
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:56.600]   It's those closest to you.
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:01.600]   This word entrusting, it means God makes no mistakes, amen?
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:04.600]   Every relationship that you have,
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:07.600]   every human person in your life,
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:11.600]   God placed there on purpose with a good and perfect plan.
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:14.600]   Agree or disagree? You better agree.
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:17.600]   Okay? Think about this.
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:23.600]   Every relationship that has been ordained in your life,
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:26.600]   God put there.
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:32.600]   Even the ones that are very painful.
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:37.600]   Are you guys following this?
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:42.600]   And if you've done something silly to damage your relationship,
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:44.600]   okay, that's on you. And if you suffer for it,
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:46.600]   remember we learned last time, right?
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:49.600]   What credit is there if you suffer for doing evil, right?
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:53.600]   But in a situation where you're completely the victim,
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:57.600]   when you've done nothing wrong,
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:00.600]   and you're being damaged by that person.
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:06.600]   Jesus was surrounded by these kinds of people,
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:09.600]   where he loved perfectly.
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:15.600]   He knew their sin. He knew their weakness.
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:21.600]   He knew their frame. And they had the audacity to mock him.
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:27.600]   He washed the feet of the guy who had already made arrangements
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:29.600]   to betray him on silent Wednesday.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:34.600]   He uttered no threats.
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:40.600]   Instead, he continually entrusted himself
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:42.600]   to the God who makes no mistakes, who is nothing,
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:46.600]   is perfectly good, who orchestrates everything for your good.
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:49.600]   Even the stuff that don't make sense.
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:53.600]   So if you think about this,
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:57.600]   in the relationships that you've been around in your life,
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:02.600]   this is the model you're supposed to follow.
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:07.600]   You know the hardest thing about ministry?
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:10.600]   It's not Bible study prep. You know what it is?
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:12.600]   People.
[01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:18.600]   You! At your work.
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:21.600]   Is your work hard or are people hard?
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:23.600]   People!
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:27.600]   Family would be great if I was the only one in it.
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:30.600]   People!
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:35.600]   In these relationships where we hupotaso,
[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:39.600]   where we subject ourselves to that relationship
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:42.600]   for their good, for their benefit,
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:45.600]   even at the risk of our harm,
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:49.600]   we don't revile, we don't utter threats,
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:51.600]   because we've died to that stuff, right?
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:53.600]   We've died to that life.
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.600]   And we're living to righteousness.
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:58.600]   To this you were called, that you might follow his example.
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:01.600]   This is all over 1 Peter.
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:04.600]   Now that's sensitive stuff, because some of you are thinking,
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:07.600]   "Well you don't know what that guy did to me. You don't know what she did to me."
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:10.600]   If you only knew. I know.
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:13.600]   I went to 12 elementary schools because I met the wrong father
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:16.600]   that God ordained in his kindness into my life.
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:18.600]   Now I love him. We have a great relationship.
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:21.600]   It only took 40 years.
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:25.600]   God orchestrates things.
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:28.600]   Every person in your life is a divine appointment.
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:31.600]   It's a cliche, but that's the case.
[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:36.600]   Now, I couldn't help but to think of
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.600]   the thieves on the crosses.
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:41.600]   We usually hear them in the singular.
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:44.600]   But I see them as thieves on the crosses.
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:45.600]   Alright, plural.
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:46.600]   So here we go.
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:49.600]   "They crucified two robbers with him," Mark's account,
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:52.600]   "one on his right, one on his left, and the Scripture was fulfilled,
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:55.600]   which says, 'He was numbered with transgressors,
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:58.600]   and those passing by were hurling abuse at him,
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:00.600]   wagging their heads and saying, 'Ha!
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:03.600]   You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days.'"
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:04.600]   That's a little too dramatic. I'm sorry.
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:08.600]   "Three days. 'Save yourself and come down from the cross.'
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:11.600]   In the same way, the chief priests also, along with the scribes,
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:13.600]   were mocking him among themselves and saying,
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:16.600]   'He saved others. He cannot save himself.'"
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:19.600]   That sounded a little Disney. I'm sorry.
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:23.600]   "Let this Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:26.600]   so that we may see and believe.
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:29.600]   And those who were crucified him were also insulted."
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:31.600]   I'm like, "You losers."
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:36.600]   Look at you. Right? I'm like, "Look at you."
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:41.600]   "Both of them were hurling insults at him along with everybody."
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:43.600]   Matthew's account.
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:46.600]   "In the same way, the chief priests also, along with the scribes and elders,
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:50.600]   were mocking him and saying, 'He saved others. He cannot save himself.
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:54.600]   He is the King of Israel. Let him come down now from the cross
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:55.600]   and we will believe him.
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:59.600]   He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he delights in him.
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:01.600]   For he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:06.600]   "The robbers who have been crucified with him were also insulting him with the same words."
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:16.600]   "He was oppressed and he was afflicted.
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:20.600]   Yet he did not open his mouth like a lamb that is led to the slaughter
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:22.600]   and like a sheep that is silent before its shearers.
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:24.600]   He did not open his mouth."
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:27.600]   Jesus opens his mouth twice, actually,
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:31.600]   in this whole Passion Week exchange.
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:34.600]   One of them is when they say, "Are you the King of the Jews?"
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:36.600]   And he said, "I am."
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:41.600]   The other one is here.
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:44.600]   "When they came to the place called the Skull,
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:48.600]   there they crucified him and the criminals, one on the right and one on the left.
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:52.600]   But Jesus was saying, 'Father, forgive them,
[01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:55.600]   for they do not know what they are doing.'
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:58.600]   And they cast lots, dividing up his garments among themselves.
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:02.600]   And the people stood by, looking on, and even the rulers were sneering at him, saying,
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:07.600]   'He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one.'
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:11.600]   The soldiers also mocked him, coming up to him, offering him sour wine
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:14.600]   and saying, 'If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.'
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:18.600]   Now there was also an inscription above him, 'This is the King of the Jews.'
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:21.600]   One of the criminals who were hanging there and was hurling abuse at him, saying,
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:24.600]   'Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us.'
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:28.600]   But the other answered, rebuking him, said,
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:34.600]   'Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:38.600]   And we indeed are suffering justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds,
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:40.600]   but this man has done nothing wrong.
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:44.600]   And he was saying, 'Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.'
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:48.600]   And he said to him, 'Truly I say to you, today you shall be with me in paradise.'
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:56.600]   I am left to my sanctified imagination, wondering when this change happened.
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:01.600]   Did you ever think about that?
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:06.600]   When did this switch happen, where all of a sudden this guy is laughing and scoffing at this Christ,
[01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:11.600]   and then all of a sudden he says, 'This is an innocent man.'
[01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:19.600]   And I want to guess that it had happened when this man, who did not revile in return,
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:24.600]   when he was threatened, or when he was suffering, he uttered no threats,
[01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:29.600]   but he kept entrusting himself to the judge who judges righteously.
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:36.600]   And that overhearing of that entrusting, perhaps this thief changed.
[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:41.600]   Are you guys following this?
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:44.600]   I'm going to go back to this thing.
[01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:51.600]   The hoop of Graham on, following in his steps.
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:58.600]   It seems to me, by what's said right before this, and by what's said right after this,
[01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:12.600]   there is a possibility that you suffering unjustly can cause a miracle to happen in the name of Christ.
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:22.600]   And as you abide in him and subject yourself to suffering, perhaps he does a miraculous fruit
[01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:28.600]   and uses that to change this person so that in the day of visitation, this man,
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:32.600]   who once was a reviler, gives glory to the God.
[01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:37.600]   And that's what I'm led to believe when I'm looking through 1 Peter.
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:49.600]   Why are we called to suffer? Just to show that, yes, we are suffering for the sake of, to give glory.
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:51.600]   How does that give glory to God?
[01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:54.600]   You know what the world does not have an answer for?
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:57.600]   Joy in the midst of suffering.
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:52:59.600]   Love in the midst of hate.
[01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:03.600]   Forgiveness in the midst of wrong.
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:07.600]   The world does not have an answer to that.
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:11.600]   And that demolishes strongholds.
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:19.600]   So when you guys think of avoiding the people that are difficult in your life,
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:21.600]   if it's your shame, shame on you.
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:22.600]   You fix that.
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:28.600]   But if someone is hurting you, it doesn't mean you go take abuse.
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:36.600]   But even if you have to subject yourself to love this person who is so unlovable,
[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:40.600]   knowing what's going to happen, who knows?
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:43.600]   You might win them over.
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:47.600]   And that person, without you saying a word,
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:51.600]   might give glory to God.
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:53.600]   And that's what I see.
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:59.600]   But our problem is, anytime they're suffering, we want to run away.
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:03.600]   For to this you were called.
[01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:08.600]   For you were called for this very purpose.
[01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:12.600]   Because you will inherit a blessing, 1 Peter 3.9.
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:17.600]   Every person in your life is on purpose.
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:22.600]   If you are the sinner, fix it.
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:28.600]   But if you are the victim, forgive.
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:31.600]   And we'll see what God does.
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:34.600]   Does that make sense?
[01:54:34.600 --> 01:54:37.600]   This is a strong passage. That's very painful.
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:39.600]   Thank you, TJ. I like that.
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:41.600]   Oh yeah. Right?
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:46.600]   This is for next week. Everything is the same except the last one.
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:50.600]   What are the goals for the wives and for the husbands in applying these verses?
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:52.600]   We know what we're supposed to do.
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:56.600]   Husbands, be considerate with your wives. Wives, be subject to your husband.
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:01.600]   But pay attention to the why. Why? What's the goal?
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:06.600]   And then today, what I want you guys to do is look through this.
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:11.600]   In what relationships currently are you tempted to revile or utter threats?
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:17.600]   This is in the case where you're the victim.
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:23.600]   What are those relationships and what role do you play?
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:29.600]   Second, in what ways has this passage grown your appreciation of Christ?
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:33.600]   How do you follow in his steps?
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:40.600]   And then third, this is not humanly, fleshly, like possible for us to just do in our flesh, right?
[01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:47.600]   But are there ways that your group members can pray for you as you entrust yourself to him who judges righteously?
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:49.600]   How?
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:52.600]   So this is a very meaty passage.
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:56.600]   It's very powerful and very scary.
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:03.600]   So my encouragement would be, share with each other and keep each other accountable.
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:07.600]   Pray for each other and keep praying for each other.
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:13.600]   Okay? So next week we're going to be looking at husbands, wives, so that should be fun.
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:18.600]   Let me pray for us and then we'll break up into a time of sharing and discussion.
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:31.600]   Lord, people stink and we're surrounded by them and we are them.
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:35.600]   But you love us.
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:39.600]   You know our frame. You know our weakness.
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:46.600]   And as far as the east is from the west, you have removed our sins from us.
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:57:01.600]   Though you understand that we are but dust, in your strange and great mercy, you choose to love us and offer a way where we're even elevated as co-heirs.
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:14.600]   In our momentary affliction, in our grief, in our struggle, help us to remember the big picture.
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:17.600]   That you are going to come back to restore everything.
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:27.600]   But help us to use every relationship in our lives that you have ordained to give you glory.
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:30.600]   Especially the ones that are tough.
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:34.600]   Help us to use those relationships to give you glory.
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:39.600]   And that in those relationships to be a message of the gospel.
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:46.600]   Help us, Lord God, because this is not something we can do by effort.
[01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:52.600]   This is only something that can be supernaturally done by those who are abiding in Christ.
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:57.600]   So keep us committed to what you've called us.
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:02.600]   Keep us sober to what your will is for the Christian.
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:11.600]   And would you receive the glory that you're due by our response of trust and faith.
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:14.600]   For we trust that you judge righteously.
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:23.600]   And we thank you, Lord God, for judging us with compassion and mercy.
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:26.600]   And not treating us as our sins deserve.
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:32.600]   For really loving us and embracing us as we are.
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:35.600]   So that we can be restored to you.
[01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:37.600]   That we can know you and be known by you.
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:39.600]   Jesus, let me pray.
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:57.600]   The previous one, right?
[01:58:57.600 --> 01:59:01.600]   It's going to be on the Facebook, TJ.
