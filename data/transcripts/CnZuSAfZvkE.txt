[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.820]   - All right, good morning.
[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.820]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.820]   I'm gonna get started with a few announcements this morning.
[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.820]   But before we get started, as you can see,
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:14.820]   as you came in, we still have those communion cups
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:15.820]   that are on your seat.
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.820]   I told you last week that we were gonna go back
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.820]   to our old style, but we forgot that we have baptism,
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.820]   and so we couldn't set up.
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.820]   And so starting from next time,
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.820]   we're gonna have to work around that.
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.820]   And so this will be the last time,
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.820]   just in case those of you guys who are upset with us
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.820]   that we're not gonna do this, is to appease your wrath.
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.820]   We're gonna do it one more time this way, this week.
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:37.820]   And then starting from next time,
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.820]   we'll go back to our traditional, okay?
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.820]   This morning, we have an announcement
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.820]   from our brother, June Im, for our prayer
[00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.820]   and fasting chain for outreach event.
[00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.820]   Yeah.
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.820]   - Good morning, everyone.
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.820]   My name is June Im from the Family Ministry.
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.820]   So as you know, our church's theme this year
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.820]   is hope and pray.
[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.820]   And one of the purposes of the outreach team
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.820]   is to encourage the church in evangelism.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.820]   So in light of these two things,
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.820]   we're organizing a fasting chain to help us pray
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.820]   as we pray for unsaved people in our lives
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.820]   that we're reaching out to.
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.820]   The fasting chain's gonna start October 17th,
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.820]   which is the Monday after our next members meeting,
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.820]   which is Sunday, October 16th.
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.820]   And it'll run until Sunday, November 6th.
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.820]   But you don't have to be a member to participate.
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.820]   If you've never fasted, fasting is a spiritual discipline
[00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.820]   which has many purposes.
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.820]   But one is, as we pray, and in our case,
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.820]   pray for unsaved people in our lives,
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:48.820]   I think fasting can be a very powerful reminder to us
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.820]   to pray and to pray fervently
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.820]   and just really crying out to God,
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.820]   especially as we're praying for the eternity
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.820]   of people in our lives.
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.820]   So you can sign up to fast one day.
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.820]   You can sign up to fast multiple days.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.820]   Or you can sign up to fast just one meal
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.820]   the day that you sign up.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.820]   And a prayer request form is also being sent around
[00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.820]   where people can submit prayer requests
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.820]   for unsaved family and friends that we're praying for.
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.820]   And those who sign up for the fasting chain
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.820]   will be asked to pray for those requests
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.820]   while we're fasting and praying.
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.820]   So on the last day of the fasting chain,
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.820]   which is Sunday, November 6th,
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.820]   we're gonna have what we're gonna call
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.820]   a Christianity Q&A panel.
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.820]   And it's gonna be after Second Service that Sunday.
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.820]   And I think this would be an opportunity for us,
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.820]   as we're fasting and praying for those people in our lives,
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.820]   to invite them to an opportunity
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.820]   where they can submit questions about Christianity
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.820]   to a panel that we're gonna have that day.
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.820]   So sign ups for the fasting chain and for prayer requests,
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.820]   they're gonna be on the church Facebook page
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.820]   and other social media platforms.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.820]   So thank you very much.
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.820]   (audience applauding)
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:12.820]   - All right, thank you for that.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.820]   So the sign ups are already,
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:15.820]   is gonna be happening right away.
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.820]   So you can go to Facebook or social media or a church app,
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:22.820]   and you'll be able to sign up for that.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.820]   For men's ministry, on October 15th,

[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:51.820]   and lunch will be provided after the meeting.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.820]   Members meeting coming up on October 16th at 2 p.m.,

[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:17.820]   that's gonna be taking place.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:21.820]   College welcome lunch is scheduled for October 23rd
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:24.820]   at 12.45 p.m., so if you wanna find out about that,
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:26.820]   if you're new to the church, and you have some questions,
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.820]   or just wanna find out more about the church,
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:33.820]   it's taking place on October 23rd at 12.45.
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.820]   And then Thanksgiving regional dinner sign up on November,
[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.820]   it's a little bit away, but they're asking for hosts,
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.820]   meaning that if you're willing to open up your home,
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.820]   and you don't have to live right near the church,
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.820]   because we have people from all over,
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.820]   from Diamond Bar all the way to Cerritos,
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.820]   and even further out, so if you have a home
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.820]   that you're willing to open up to invite guests to come in
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.820]   and share a meal together for Thanksgiving,
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.820]   they're asking people to sign up for the host.
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.820]   And one last thing is, from trunk formation,
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.820]   for when the world celebrates Halloween,
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.820]   on that day where we bring our children to church
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.820]   and we allow them to experience carnivals
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.820]   and vary games and stuff like that,
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.820]   and so the people who are running that
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.820]   are asking for people to volunteer,
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.820]   so if you have a trunk, which is all of you,
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.820]   and you wanna volunteer to set up a game
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.820]   for the children to play and then pass out candy,
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:30.820]   or if you are, you're creatively challenged,
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.820]   and you're not able to do that,
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.820]   we actually have games that are stored.
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.820]   So all you need to do is be willing to run the game.
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.820]   So you just volunteer your car, open up your car,
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.820]   and then just, if you can't set it up,
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.820]   we'll help you set it up.
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.820]   And then all you have to do is volunteer,
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.820]   just bring your car early on that day,
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:53.820]   and just park it with your trunk open,
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.820]   and then the kids will come and play games.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.820]   So they said that we need more people to volunteer for that,
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.820]   so if you haven't done so and you're willing to do that,
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:05.820]   please contact Facebook, okay?
[00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.820]   So contact, go on Facebook or go to our app,
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.820]   and there'll be some sort of connection there,
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.820]   and they'll be able to let you know, okay?
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.820]   All right, so let me pray for the offering again.
[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.820]   Our offering baskets is in the back,
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.820]   and if you have a physical offering, you can put it there.
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.820]   And then those of you who are giving electronically,
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.820]   which is most of you, we're asking that if it's possible
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.820]   to use Zelle and not Venmo or PayPal
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.820]   because they're starting to give us issues with--
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.820]   we have to pay a percentage for that.
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.820]   So if you can go directly to Zelle.
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.820]   But if you don't have that, the other things are also open, okay?
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.820]   We'll give you a minute to do that after I pray,
[00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.820]   and then afterwards, our sister Bonnie is going to come up,
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.820]   and she's going to give her testimony and be baptized this morning.
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:50.820]   All right, let's pray.
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.820]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much for your continued grace,
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.820]   the love that we are aware of,
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.820]   the love that continues to sustain us that we may not be aware of.
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:06.820]   Help us, Lord God, to open our eyes to know the depth, the height,
[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.820]   the width and length of the love of Christ,
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.820]   that together, Lord God, as the body of Christ,
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.820]   that we may know you, worship you, honor you.
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:19.820]   We pray that even as we give, help us to give purposefully, intentionally.
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.820]   May it not be given out of compulsion but out of joy.
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:27.820]   May it be multiplied for your use, your kingdom, and your glory only.
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.820]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:42.820]   Hi, my name is Bonnie Wong, and I have the privilege of sharing my testimony today.
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:49.820]   Church is supposed to be a loving and welcoming place, but for 20 years I sat alone on Sundays.
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:53.820]   I felt judged and misunderstood, which made me feel like I wasn't good enough.
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:58.820]   Not having any close friends, being compared to other students by my parents,
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:03.820]   and having bouts of anxiety reinforced those feelings that I wasn't a good person.
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:08.820]   To prove my worth, I threw myself into my journalism career, in relationships for validation,
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:12.820]   and in developing a funny personality for acceptance.
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:18.820]   Over time, my anger turned into hate. I spent hours scrolling on my phone, judging people's Instagram pictures.
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:22.820]   I served in college, but it was out of social pressure.
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:28.820]   In my heart, I wanted to retaliate against others because I felt I wasn't meeting their standards.
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:34.820]   I sought help for my anxiety, but therapists told me I just needed to accept the broken parts of myself,
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:42.820]   or shifted the blame elsewhere, like the way I was raised by my strict parents, or traumas outside of my control.
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:50.820]   After graduating college, I still called myself a Christian because I believed God existed, but I didn't know Jesus personally.
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:55.820]   I started attending Berean last December and began membership classes this past spring.
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:59.820]   As part of the class, I met with Pastor Mark for an informal interview.
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:03.820]   He read my testimony and asked me to clarify when my conversion was.
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.820]   I said that it happened in college, but I wasn't really sure.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:13.820]   He mentioned one of the indications of faith was bearing fruit, and suggested I be baptized before my induction as a new member.
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:18.820]   I left the meeting feeling insecure, questioning what those years of church-going amounted to,
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:24.820]   but through Pastor Mark not letting me off the hook, I began to reevaluate why I wasn't bearing fruit,
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:27.820]   and that led me to think about my sin.
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:32.820]   In Matthew 22, 34, the Pharisees asked Jesus what the greatest commandment was,
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.820]   and he replied that the law can be summed up by two.
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:40.820]   "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind."
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.820]   This is the great and foremost commandment.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.820]   The second is like it. "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:51.820]   Because of my anger, I was unable to fulfill the second commandment to love others.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:59.820]   I felt justified in my behavior until I realized my hatred of others was a direct offense against God's command.
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:03.820]   In service last month, Pastor Peter Kim preached a sermon on the baptism of repentance,
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:09.820]   where he said that it wasn't enough to just feel bad about our sin, but that we needed to turn away from it.
[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:15.820]   He then quoted 1 John 1, 9, which promises, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just,
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:19.820]   and will forgive our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness."
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:26.820]   All along, I've been trying to fix myself by just doing better, but I never confessed my sin to God or repented.
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:34.820]   I only saw myself as the victim, but did not take responsibility for my hatred of people, self-sufficiency, and pride.
[00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.820]   It was at that moment that the Holy Spirit revealed to me that I was a sinner,
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.820]   not just against others, but ultimately against a holy God.
[00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:48.820]   Christ suffered on the cross for me, taking it upon himself to bear my sin to the point of public mockery and physical torture.
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.820]   Yet he continued to do so for my sake.
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:58.820]   Through Christ's sacrifice, I am able to better understand his love for me, which gives me the power to love others.
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:04.820]   After praying for forgiveness and asking Jesus Christ into my heart, I felt a sense of overwhelming peace.
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:11.820]   By his grace, the Lord delivered me from my bitterness and freed me from the darkness that was so deeply rooted in my heart.
[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:16.820]   Because I have experienced God's love for me through his sacrifice of his Son on the cross for my sins,
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.820]   I genuinely love him and have the power to love others now, too.
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:26.820]   It is through this saving faith that I can have relational peace with others because I now have relational peace with God.
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.820]   I'd like to close with Galatians 2.20, which says,
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:34.820]   "I have been crucified with Christ and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:40.820]   And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself up for me."
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:41.820]   Thank you.
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:50.820]   [Applause]
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:35:12.820]   [Pause]
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:27.820]   [Pause]
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:40.820]   [Applause]
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.820]   All right, thank you, Bonnie, for that great testimony.
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:48.820]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke 3.
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:36:01.820]   I will be reading from verse 18 through 22.
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:06.820]   Luke 3, verse 18 to 22.
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.820]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:11.820]   "So with many other exhortations he preached the gospel to people,
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:16.820]   but when Herod the tetrarch was reprimanded by him because of Herodias, his brother's wife,
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:21.820]   and because of all the wicked things which Herod had done, Herod also added this to them all.
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.820]   He locked John up in prison.
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:29.820]   Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus was also baptized, and while he was praying, heaven was opened.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:34.820]   And the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove, and a voice came out of heaven,
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:42.820]   'You are my beloved Son, in you I am well pleased.'" Let's pray.
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:50.820]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for guiding us, leading us, and the privilege that we have to come and worship you.
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:54.820]   Help us, Lord God, never take for granted the gift that you've given us,
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:37:01.820]   that we may come before you to celebrate, to give you the praise and awe and adoration that you deserve.
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:06.820]   I pray that your word would speak to us, that only your word would speak to us.
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:12.820]   May it go forth and not return until it has accomplished its purpose. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:18.820]   So as you guys know, if you've been following with us in the teaching of the gospel of Luke,
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.820]   that we spent about a month talking about John's ministry and his message.
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:29.820]   And so we've been transitioning, starting from last week, this was John's words about how Jesus was going to come,
[00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:34.820]   and he's going to be baptized with the Holy Spirit and fire, and then he has a winnowing fork,
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:39.820]   who's going to separate between the wheat and the chaff.
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:47.820]   And so this week we look at verse 18 to 20, and you would think that after presenting John the Baptist,
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:53.820]   the greatest prophet of the Old Covenant, the greatest man who was born of a woman in the Old Covenant,
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:59.820]   and after presenting Christ and preparing ministry for Christ, such great ministry,
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.820]   that you would think that his life would end with some sort of recognition and honor.
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:11.820]   Instead, Luke just, matter of fact, tells us in verse 18 and 20 that after his exhortation,
[00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:17.820]   because he called out Herodias for his sins, that he got angered and they just put him in prison.
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:21.820]   And we're going to get more into this later when we get to chapter 7 through 9,
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.820]   the story is kind of more fleshed out later on over there.
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:29.820]   But the way Luke ends his ministry here is that after he's done all that, right,
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.820]   he prepared for Jesus' ministry, the Son of God's going to come,
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:36.820]   and then he said some stuff to Herod, and then he's in prison.
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.820]   And then he just moves on, you know.
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:45.820]   It's almost kind of like, that's a strange way to present John the Baptist, right?
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:49.820]   After he's done all of that, he just, "I went to prison," and then Jesus showed up in baptism.
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:53.820]   And that's how the transition takes place here.
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:58.820]   If we want to know the heart of John, as this transition was taking place,
[00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:05.820]   we find that in the Gospel of John, John chapter 3, verse 26 through 30,
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:11.820]   where his disciples are beginning to see that all that work that John and his disciples put in
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:16.820]   to gather people to baptize them were beginning to shift toward Christ.
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:20.820]   It doesn't spell it out here, but you can kind of hear from the tone and the context
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:23.820]   that John's disciples are concerned.
[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:27.820]   "Hey, we're losing our people. They're all going to Jesus. Is this okay?"
[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:29.820]   And this is how it is fleshed out.
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.820]   John chapter 3, verse 26, "And they came to John and said to him,
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:36.820]   'Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan to whom you have testified,
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:40.820]   behold, he is baptizing, and all are coming to him.'
[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:45.820]   John answered and said, 'A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven.'"
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:46.820]   Let me stop right there.
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:50.820]   So first thing that John says is, you're concerned about people going
[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:55.820]   and that Jesus is taking all our disciples, and John's first response is,
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:40:00.820]   "That's not up to us. I didn't draw them to myself. God did.
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:04.820]   And now that it's time that God is drawing them to them, that's God's doing."
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:06.820]   I mean, it's such a humble way to put this.
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:10.820]   Instead of saying, "They're all going to--they're not recognizing me."
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:14.820]   Instead, he's calming his disciples down that this is not my ministry or your ministry.
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.820]   This is God's ministry.
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:20.820]   And I remember this week we had lunch with Pastor Lee from Baby Box,
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:24.820]   and one of the questions that we asked him was, you know, like,
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:27.820]   "Do you sometimes get frustrated when you meet these mega church pastors
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.820]   and, you know, maybe a lot of them are kind of like--are not supporting?"
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.820]   And that was kind of like the question that was asked, and he said, "No, I feel compassion for them."
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:39.820]   And he said, "Every pastor that I meet, they're so tired, and they're so burnt out,
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:43.820]   and the reason why they're so burnt out is because they have these mega churches
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:46.820]   and mega visions and all these things that they want to accomplish for Jesus,
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:50.820]   and they're running so hard to get these things done,
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:55.820]   and in the context, they're burnt out and tired, bitter, angry."
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:58.820]   And so he said he actually feels compassion for them.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:02.820]   And then he describes how his ministry, how everything was just kind of happening,
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:05.820]   and said, "Jesus opens the door, and I go in, and then God provides,
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:09.820]   and when we need the funds, he gives it to us. He answers our prayer."
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.820]   And the way he describes it, it's like, "Man, it's just--everything that's happening in his life,
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:16.820]   it's just happening to him, because God has anointed him,
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:21.820]   and he just, like, he was just saying, 'Yeah, this is--that's not how ministry should be.'"
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:25.820]   And when I was reading that, I kind of thought of his statement, what he said,
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:29.820]   and he said, "A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him."
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:34.820]   How much of our frustration is because we have decided that that's what I want,
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:38.820]   and I'm trying so hard to get it, and then when that's not happening,
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.820]   it leads to frustration and anger and bitterness.
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:46.820]   I want my family to be this way. I want my relationship--I want the church to be this way.
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:50.820]   And you're trying so hard to accomplish your--what you think that God wants.
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:55.820]   He says, "No, you can't. You can only have what God gives you."
[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:59.820]   And so John corrects his disciples, and he's like, "Stop trying so hard.
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:05.820]   You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, 'I am not the Christ, but I have been sent ahead of him.'"
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:09.820]   I told you all along, I'm not gathering people for myself. I'm preparing them for Christ.
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:12.820]   So now that people are going there, you shouldn't be surprised.
[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:17.820]   Verse 29, "He who has the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:21.820]   who stands and hears him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice.
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:24.820]   So this joy of mine has been made full."
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.820]   Not only, he says, "Can I not control that?"
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:32.820]   And every person going there--and that's the reason why I came into ministry in the first place.
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:36.820]   He says, "I'm not the groom."
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.820]   He said, "He's the groom."
[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:45.820]   And so it wouldn't make any sense for the groomsman who's standing there to support the groom
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:50.820]   to be bitter and angry that the groom is getting all the attention.
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:56.820]   The ridiculousness of somebody who is in ministry trying to glorify God
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:59.820]   and frustrated that they're not being honored in the process.
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:07.820]   So he says, "In fact, the fact that more people are going to him, it was creating great joy for him
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:08.820]   as a result of that."
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:11.820]   And then he says, "He must increase, I must decrease."
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:15.820]   And that pretty much summarizes John the Baptist's ministry.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:20.820]   "He must increase, but I must decrease."
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:25.820]   Such a simple statement, not just for John the Baptist, for every single one of us.
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:27.820]   This is the theme of every Christian.
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:32.820]   This is the theme of everyone who has been saved on the process of being sanctified
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.820]   and ultimately being glorified.
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.820]   "He must increase, but I must decrease."
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:43.820]   If people know more about you than the Christ that you love,
[00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.820]   then you must decrease and he must increase.
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:54.820]   If you speak more of what you do, then he must increase and you must decrease.
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:44:00.820]   Our primary goal is every person that we meet, that they recognize him and what he's done,
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:05.820]   what he's doing, how he's affecting us, how he is worthy.
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:08.820]   That should be our ultimate goal.
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:09.820]   And that's what John the Baptist says.
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:14.820]   He does all this great work and so many people, even the leaders of Israel, are coming to him
[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:18.820]   and as soon as Jesus Christ appears, he just disappears.
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:21.820]   He doesn't ride off into the sunset.
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:25.820]   There's no honor and glory. His disciples just start to go to him.
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:28.820]   He ends up in prison. Eventually he gets beheaded and the end. That's it.
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.820]   That's all we hear about John the Baptist.
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:34.820]   The only part we hear about him was the work that he did during that short period
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.820]   to say, "He's coming, he's coming, he's coming, he's coming."
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:39.820]   And then he comes, boom, he's gone.
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:46.820]   We'll get more into why John got beheaded later on because it's brought up later on in the Gospel of Luke.
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:53.820]   But here, Luke just ends his ministry that way and then he moves on to Jesus' ministry in chapter 321.
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:56.820]   Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus was also baptized.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:03.820]   Now you notice here how Jesus' baptism was not very spectacular.
[00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:08.820]   He says, "All these people, hundreds, thousands of people are coming to Jesus being baptized
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:10.820]   and I'm not sure if they stood in a line or not.
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.820]   I'm not sure what the culture was at that time."
[00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:17.820]   You go to some countries and they get in straight lines and you go to some countries there's a mob.
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:21.820]   My guess is this is a mob kind of crowd.
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:25.820]   That they're not really. So hundreds of people are just rushing John
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:28.820]   and it says Jesus was just one of them.
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:32.820]   So he's like son of God who's going to be baptizing with the Holy Spirit.
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:36.820]   He's just in the mob and then everybody else getting baptized, he also got baptized.
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:43.820]   And then he says, "Heaven was opened after he was baptized and the Holy Spirit descended upon him
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.820]   in bodily form like a dove and a voice came out of heaven,
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:49.820]   'You are my beloved son and you I am well pleased.'"
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:54.820]   Until this point, Jesus lived in obscurity.
[00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:59.820]   In fact, even the town that he grew up in, the only reason why I even know the name Nazareth
[00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:03.820]   was because it's mentioned in the Bible where Jesus was raised.
[00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:05.820]   Outside of that, there's no mention of Nazareth.
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:08.820]   You wouldn't even know that this city existed.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:13.820]   In fact, outside of his very birth where Angel Gabriel says that he's going to come
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:17.820]   and he's going to save the world. Outside of his very birth.
[00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:21.820]   And then the only other time we hear about Jesus is when he's 12 years old at the temple.
[00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:25.820]   But outside of that, we know nothing. He just disappears.
[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:29.820]   In fact, he lived in such obscurity when Jesus appears,
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.820]   even John the Baptist didn't recognize him.
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:35.820]   In John chapter 1, verse 33, it says, "I did not recognize him,
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:39.820]   but he who sent me to baptize in water said to me,
[00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:42.820]   'He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon him,
[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.820]   this is the one who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.'"
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:50.820]   Even though they were related, they lived in separate towns and they didn't know each other.
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:54.820]   And so when Jesus comes on the scene, even John, who spent all his life,
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:57.820]   the whole reason why he was born was to prepare for Jesus,
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:01.820]   he didn't even recognize him when he showed up.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:07.820]   But from that, now all of a sudden he gets baptized and the voice of God the Father says,
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:10.820]   "This is the one. This is the one that you've been waiting for.
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.820]   This is the one that John has been preparing for."
[00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.820]   But the fundamental question that we need to ask ourselves is,
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:21.820]   why did he need to get baptized?
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:24.820]   Baptism is mentioned in all four of the Gospels.
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:28.820]   So if you've ever studied the Gospel, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:32.820]   you know that the Gospel of John is distinct
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:37.820]   because the first three Gospels have so many stories that are kind of repeated in each other.
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:40.820]   They call it the Synoptic Gospel, similar gospel.
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:46.820]   But when it comes to the Gospel of John, almost half of it is about the last week of his life.
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:51.820]   80% or more of John's content is unique to John.
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:56.820]   Only about 20% to 15% you see it repeated in the three Gospels.
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:01.820]   So when you hear a story that is repeated in all four Gospels, including John,
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:04.820]   you know that that story is particularly important
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:11.820]   because John only chose things that fit into his narrative of the point of Jesus' deity,
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:15.820]   of identifying and to making sure that people understood who Jesus was.
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:21.820]   So this particular story of John's or Jesus' baptism is mentioned in all four Gospels.
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:26.820]   But again, the question is, it's so important, but why is it so important?
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.820]   Why did Jesus have to be baptized?
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:33.820]   Now, when we say John the Baptist's baptism, what kind of baptism was it?
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.820]   We know it was water baptism, right?
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:40.820]   But what was John's baptism for?
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:47.820]   Baptism of repentance.
[00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:49.820]   I gave you a chance.
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:52.820]   Repentance.
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:55.820]   He was calling people out to come and repent.
[00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:56.820]   That was his main message.
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:01.820]   So when the Pharisees and the scribes were coming, I said,
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:04.820]   "Why are you coming and going through the Moshe and not really repenting?"
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:07.820]   Bear fruits with repentance.
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:13.820]   So if John the Baptist's baptism was a baptism of repentance,
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:16.820]   why did Jesus have to be baptized?
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.820]   Why did he have some sins that he needed to be cleansed by?
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:22.820]   Was there something that he did as a child that he needed to be cleansed by
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:24.820]   so that he can get into sinless ministry?
[00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:26.820]   That would be blasphemy.
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:29.820]   It would be contradicting everything that we know in Scripture.
[00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:32.820]   2 Corinthians 5:21, it says, "He made him who knew no sin,
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:37.820]   had no personal knowledge of sin, to be sin on our behalf
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:39.820]   so that we might become the righteousness of God in him."
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:42.820]   If Jesus had any sin, if he was tainted in any way,
[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:46.820]   he would not have been the atoning sacrifice for sinners.
[00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:50.820]   It would have nullified him because he would not be complete.
[00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:54.820]   Hebrews 4:15, it says, "For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:58.820]   with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in all things as we are,
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:00.820]   yet without sin."
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:02.820]   No sin.
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:06.820]   So if Jesus had no sin, has no knowledge of sin,
[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.820]   never experienced sin in a personal level,
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.820]   then what did his baptism mean?
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:17.820]   Well, if this is perplexing for us, it was also perplexing for John.
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:21.820]   Because when Jesus stood in the crowd wanting to be baptized,
[00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:24.820]   John looked at him and he says this in Matthew 3:14,
[00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:29.820]   "But John tried to prevent him, saying, 'I have need to be baptized by you,
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:32.820]   and do you come to me?
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:36.820]   I'm the one who needs the cleansing. I'm the one who needs to repent.
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:39.820]   I baptize you.'" And here's the answer.
[00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:42.820]   Jesus says, answering, he said to him, "Permitted at this time,
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:47.820]   for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness."
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:50.820]   So if you've ever wondered why Jesus needed to be baptized
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:53.820]   or why he was being baptized, there's your answer.
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:55.820]   That's the sermon for this morning.
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:58.820]   You have the answer. Somebody asked you that question.
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:02.820]   Jesus said, "To fulfill all righteousness."
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:07.820]   But if you are an inductive Bible study studier, you would ask further than that.
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:13.820]   And that question is, "What righteousness is he trying to fulfill?"
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:16.820]   Clearly, that's what he says, "To fulfill all righteousness."
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:21.820]   The word for fulfill is the same word used in the book of Ephesians
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:23.820]   where he says, "To be filled with the Holy Spirit."
[00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:29.820]   And the word fill basically means to have complete, to the brim.
[00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:36.820]   Meaning that to fill with righteousness means that in every way that he could be righteous,
[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:40.820]   every way that he could be obedient, Jesus fulfilled it.
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:48.820]   He filled himself with righteousness, to be made complete in righteousness.
[00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:53.820]   So this morning, we want to try to look at that text and say,
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:55.820]   look at the Bible and say, "What is it fulfilling?"
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:59.820]   If he is trying to be made complete in righteousness,
[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:04.820]   what righteousness is he fulfilling that Jesus will be baptized by John's baptism?
[00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:06.820]   So there's three things I want to highlight here,
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:09.820]   hopefully that will help us understand what's taking place here.
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:14.820]   So number one, in what way did Jesus fulfill righteousness in baptism?
[00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:18.820]   One, Jesus fulfilled righteousness by submitting himself to the established path to righteousness
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:21.820]   through John's baptism.
[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:28.820]   Now, we have to understand that up to this point, that the religious system was rejected by God.
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:34.820]   If you study the prophets of the Old Testament, all the prophets come and say,
[00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:38.820]   "Because you did not honor me as God, because you went after idols,
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:42.820]   because your religiousness had nothing to do with me,"
[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:46.820]   he says, "I'm going to bring a famine to the land, that I'm going to reject your worship.
[00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:49.820]   All your sacrifices are meaningless to me."
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:55.820]   At that time, Christ appears that the religious system of the Jews were already rejected.
[00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:58.820]   In fact, remember at the temple, when Jesus walked into the temple twice,
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:01.820]   in the beginning of his ministry and at the end of his ministry,
[00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:06.820]   he saw what was going on, he became angry, and the disciples said, "Remember,
[00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:10.820]   the zeal for his house would consume him."
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:17.820]   He saw that the religious leaders didn't even make room for women to come in.
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:19.820]   If you happen to be a Gentile, there's nowhere to come into worship.
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.820]   Even if you were a man, you're coming into the temple,
[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:29.820]   they ended up bartering and doing business where it was designated for worship.
[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:32.820]   Temple worship was basically rejected by God by the time Christ came.
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:35.820]   That's why John the Baptist, instead of going into Jerusalem,
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:38.820]   goes out to the Jordan River to do his ministry.
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:42.820]   The path of righteousness that God has established to come to him
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:45.820]   was taken from Jerusalem out to the Jordan River.
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:50.820]   So John the Baptist, his baptism, was the righteousness that God had established
[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:54.820]   at that time for people to come and to meet God.
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:58.820]   So when Jesus says that I have come to fulfill all righteousness,
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:02.820]   he is acknowledging that John the Baptist is sent from God.
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:09.820]   That before he comes into ministry, he acknowledges that God's anointing hand is upon John.
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:13.820]   Hebrews chapter 5, 8-9, he says, "Although he was a son,
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:17.820]   he learned obedience from the things which he suffered."
[00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:20.820]   He learned obedience.
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:24.820]   It wasn't because he was rebellious. It wasn't because he was disobedient.
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:28.820]   He said in every way he learned to submit himself to righteousness.
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:30.820]   In every way.
[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:34.820]   He says in verse 9, "And having been made perfect,"
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:38.820]   not because he was imperfect and there was some imperfection in him
[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:48.820]   that needed to be corrected, the word perfect, "telaios," basically means to make it complete.
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:52.820]   That what he came to do, that he would complete it.
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:58.820]   And so what it means is that Christ came and he learned obedience
[00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:03.820]   by submitting himself to all that was required of every man.
[00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:06.820]   And he was made perfect. He took to completion
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:10.820]   that everything that was expected of sinful man.
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:14.820]   He became to all those who obey him the source of eternal salvation.
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:18.820]   And that's why it says in Philippians 2, 5-8, when he calls all the church,
[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:21.820]   "Have this attitude in yourself which was also in Christ Jesus,
[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:24.820]   who although he existed in the form of God,
[00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:27.820]   did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:30.820]   but emptied himself, taking the form of a bond servant,
[00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:33.820]   and being made in likeness, meant being found in appearance as a man.
[00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:37.820]   He humbled himself by becoming obedient,
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:41.820]   even to the point of death, even death on the cross.
[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:48.820]   Christ, the Son of God, even to his own creation, John the Baptist,
[00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:51.820]   he humbled himself to that degree.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:55.820]   So when he says it is to fulfill all righteousness,
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:59.820]   it means that he needed to humble himself before he is exalted.
[00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:02.820]   That's what he means.
[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:07.820]   If you've ever actively tried to humble yourself,
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:10.820]   you know how difficult that is.
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:13.820]   If you're sitting here thinking, "That's not that difficult."
[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:15.820]   It's probably because you haven't tried it.
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.820]   It's probably because it's like, "I don't need to humble myself."
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:21.820]   But if you've ever actively tried to humble yourself,
[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:25.820]   you know how difficult that is. You know how painful that is.
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:30.820]   We live all our lives trying to be more honorable,
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:34.820]   get better jobs, buy certain cars, live in certain places.
[00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:38.820]   We raise our kids to do the same so they can get better grades.
[00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:42.820]   They can run faster. They can compete and they can win.
[00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:46.820]   So our default nature is our own glory.
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:49.820]   That's why we get offended when people don't give us honor,
[00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:52.820]   or they slander us, because it hurts us
[00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:55.820]   when we are humbled or humiliated.
[00:56:55.820 --> 00:57:02.820]   So to actively humble ourselves, it goes against our flesh.
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:07.820]   But Jesus, God, He said, "emptied Himself, humbled Himself
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:13.820]   to the point where He was a servant, even death on a cross."
[00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:17.820]   You know, I have two very distinct memories of my father.
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:20.820]   And I know many of you who had immigrant parents.
[00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:25.820]   Maybe your parents were raised, like full-grown in another culture,
[00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:29.820]   and then they came here. So you may have some memory of your parents
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:32.820]   when maybe you were younger and the struggles that your parents went through.
[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:35.820]   I have two very distinct memories of my dad.
[00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:37.820]   I have memories of my dad out in Korea.
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:41.820]   He was highly educated. The reason why he came to the United States
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:43.820]   was because he wanted to get his doctorate in ministry.
[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:47.820]   And he planted a church and it grew. He was a seminary professor.
[00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:51.820]   And that small town that we lived in, it was the largest church in that area.
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:56.820]   So I remember when I was at school, I would always be introduced as "so-and-so's son,"
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:58.820]   because everybody knew who my dad was.
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:02.820]   So if I got into trouble, all my friends would get hit,
[00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:07.820]   and then I would be spared less. You know, I'd get hit less.
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:11.820]   Or I'd go to some store and say, "Oh, this is Pastor Kim's son."
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:14.820]   And then so they would, you know, not everywhere, but every once in a while,
[00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:17.820]   they would do this. So my dad, because where we lived,
[00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:20.820]   and because he was a pastor of a large church in that area,
[00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:22.820]   that we kind of got special treatment.
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:28.820]   And then the other part of my memory is all the years that I remember him in the United States.
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:33.820]   And all of my memory of my dad in the United States was as a janitor,
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:37.820]   you know, fixing things and working in the dry cleaners, in the heat,
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:40.820]   and the struggles that he had, and working in small churches.
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:44.820]   And so the humbled life that he led while he was in the United States,
[00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:47.820]   but I also remember what it was like for him when he was out in Korea.
[00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:51.820]   We actually had people come pick us up at our condo, take us to church.
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:56.820]   And so he had very distinct lives.
[00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:59.820]   As a child, I didn't think much of it.
[00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:03.820]   You know, I just said, "Why did we move? It was better out in Korea."
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:07.820]   But I know, you know, like now as an adult looking back at it,
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:13.820]   and it's not just my dad, and I know many of your parents sacrificed, you know,
[00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:14.820]   and they did the same.
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:18.820]   They were educated, and they were honored, and they had all the opportunities,
[00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:21.820]   and they came here, and they couldn't speak English.
[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:26.820]   So the only jobs, even if you had a Ph.D., even if you were a professor of a large university,
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:31.820]   the only job that you were capable of doing here was a janitor, a physical laborer.
[00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:36.820]   And so much of the immigrant history here are people who are very well educated,
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:42.820]   maybe even honored in some places, and came here and had to start all over from nothing.
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:47.820]   So when I think about that, the sacrifices that the immigrant parents made
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:54.820]   so that you and I can be living in this great country, it's humbling.
[00:59:54.820 --> 01:00:00.820]   I share all of that, not to talk about my father, but imagine if it's that hard
[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:07.820]   for us to even imagine doing what the previous generation did for us.
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:13.820]   This is the son of God who was worshipped by creation.
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:21.820]   He saw sinners, and instead of turning away, he decided to come.
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:29.820]   When you and I travel, we make sure that we book hotels in nice areas.
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:34.820]   When we travel, we want to make sure that we're going to nice places, we eat good food.
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:38.820]   But if you find out that you're going to the slums, first thing you would do is change your itinerary.
[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:42.820]   That's not where we go. Now, every once in a while, we may do that for ministry.
[01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:45.820]   We're going into the slums because we want to experience, we want to know, we want to help.
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:49.820]   But even then, we go there for short term. We go there on experience, we come back,
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:53.820]   we feel bad, so we donate some money, and hopefully we can do some good.
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:58.820]   But we don't buy a house there. We don't camp out there.
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:03.820]   In fact, even in the church, there are certain people who say weird things and bother us
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:08.820]   and make us feel uncomfortable. Our natural tendency is to find people that we're comfortable with.
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:11.820]   These are people that I'm going to run with. These are people that I like.
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:16.820]   And then that awkward person who says certain things and kind of keep them at a distance.
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:19.820]   Because that's our natural tendency.
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:24.820]   If we look at something that is bothering us or smelly or different,
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:29.820]   our natural tendency is to get as far away from that as possible.
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:34.820]   Jesus looked at our sins, the filth that you and I live in,
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:37.820]   and instead of pinching his nose and walking the other way,
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:47.820]   he decided to come and humble himself and took on a form of a servant.
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:52.820]   So when Jesus says to fulfill all righteousness, he jumped in full blown.
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:58.820]   He didn't just dip his feet. He didn't just look at that and say, "Oh, I know what it's like."
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:03.820]   But he pitched a tent among us. He lived among us. He walked among us.
[01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.820]   He drank what we drank. He lived what we lived.
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:11.820]   He experienced the pain that all sinful people living in a sinful world experiences.
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:15.820]   That's what he means when he says he fulfilled to fulfill all righteousness.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:20.820]   Number two, Jesus fulfilled all righteousness by identifying with fallen men in every way.
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:24.820]   Hebrews 2, 14-15, "Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood,
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:28.820]   he himself likewise shall also partook of the same,
[01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:33.820]   that through death he might render powerless him who had power of death,
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:40.820]   that is the devil, and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives."
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:44.820]   Instead of turning the other way, he came, and not only so that he can save us,
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:47.820]   he says so that he can be sympathetic to us.
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:53.820]   It would be enough if he saw our rebellion and said, "Enough!
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:57.820]   I'm going to be merciful to them, and I'm not going to judge them."
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:59.820]   That would be enough for us to be justified.
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:04.820]   For him to die, go to the cross, get back to his glory, and experience worship.
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:08.820]   Instead, he didn't just justify us.
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:15.820]   He said he took on and experienced everything that a sinful man would experience
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:18.820]   so that he may become a sympathetic high priest.
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:24.820]   Hebrews 2, 17-18, "Therefore, he had to be made like his brethren in all things
[01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:28.820]   so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest,
[01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:33.820]   not just a God who saves us, not just a king to be worshipped and honored and obeyed,
[01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:37.820]   but a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God
[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:39.820]   to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
[01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:43.820]   For since he himself was tempted in that which he suffered,
[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:47.820]   he is able to come to the aid of those who are tempted."
[01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:50.820]   He didn't just die and say, "You know what? Forgive them."
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:54.820]   Like we would consider a righteous judge or a good, merciful judge and say,
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:58.820]   "We're not going to carry out the sentence," and then just goes home and lives his life.
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:02.820]   He said, "No, he pitched a tent among us, and he lived among us.
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:09.820]   He experienced everything that we experience so that he can be a sympathetic high priest."
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:16.820]   Our God isn't standing at a distance saying, "Now that I've done all the things, you better worship me."
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:18.820]   So many people worship him from a distance.
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:22.820]   They honor him and admire him from a distance.
[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:29.820]   But it is clear that what Jesus wants is for us to come to him, come to him.
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.820]   He's not just a God who died for us.
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:35.820]   He's not just a king to be honored.
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:42.820]   He's a sympathetic, sympathetic high priest who sympathizes with us,
[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:51.820]   who hurts for us, who aches for us, who pleads for us, who intercedes for us.
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:58.820]   So he experienced all that you and I could experience in order that when we look to Christ,
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:02.820]   that we're not just looking at an open door.
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:13.820]   We're looking at Christ who is inviting us, "Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:15.820]   Can you imagine that?
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:21.820]   The God of the universe looking at our sins.
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:26.820]   You are more aware of your sins than I will ever be.
[01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:31.820]   And I am more aware of my sins than you will ever be.
[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:33.820]   I'm not going to tell you.
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:39.820]   I'll tell you if I have to tell you, but I'm not going to tell you every thought, every anger, every bitterness.
[01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:40.820]   I'm not going to tell you all that.
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:42.820]   I know it.
[01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:46.820]   I know the sins that I struggle with, and you know the sins that you struggle with.
[01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:53.820]   And if you're honest with yourself, when God sees through all of that, even beyond what you're aware of,
[01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:56.820]   would you go to you?
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:59.820]   Would you go to you?
[01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:01.820]   My guess is we wouldn't.
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:02.820]   We wouldn't.
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:04.820]   But he did.
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:06.820]   He came to us.
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:08.820]   He walked in our shoes.
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:10.820]   He lived where we lived.
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:20.820]   He experienced what we experienced, all so that we can come to him, and by going to him, bring us to the Father.
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:28.820]   Isaiah 53, 12, "And he was numbered with the transgressors, and he himself bore the sins of many, and interceded for the transgressors."
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:34.820]   Number three, "Jesus fulfilled all righteousness through fulfilling the messianic promise."
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:39.820]   This statement that's made here, he said, "The Holy Spirit descended upon him bodily formed like a dove,
[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:45.820]   and a voice came out of heaven, 'You are my son, beloved son, in you I am well pleased.'"
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:52.820]   If you notice here that Jesus is coming from obscurity, and he's being highlighted, and God the Father is saying, "He's the one.
[01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:53.820]   You are my son.
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:56.820]   You are my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased."
[01:06:56.820 --> 01:07:00.820]   And so the people can see that that's the one, and John needed to know he was the one.
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:02.820]   The people needed to know that he was the one.
[01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:09.820]   And if you notice here, the whole three persons of the Trinity is there testifying.
[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:18.820]   The Son being baptized, the Holy Spirit descending upon him like a dove, and God the Father verbally saying, "You are my son."
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:23.820]   This was a direct fulfillment of the messianic promise in Psalm chapter 2, verse 7.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:26.820]   It says, "I will surely tell of the decree of the Lord."
[01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:29.820]   He said to me, "You are my son. Today I have begotten you."
[01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:38.820]   You notice a difference here where he says, "I have begotten you," and in the statement in Luke, it says that, "I am pleased with you."
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:44.820]   Well, some people have said, "Oh, he's begotten. He must have been created. Maybe he's a son that God had."
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:49.820]   Well, the term "begotten" is the same term that is used to be pleased.
[01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:57.820]   Just like when we say "firstborn" isn't talking about first, second, third, or fourth, it means the unique position of that person, firstborn.
[01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:02.820]   So when he says he's begotten, it's just another way of saying the preciousness of his son.
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:11.820]   And so that's expressed when the God the Father says in Luke when he comes out of the water, "You are my son, in whom I am well pleased."
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:20.820]   Paul repeats that, the messianic prophecy in Psalm chapter 2, when he is preaching his first sermon in Acts chapter 13.
[01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:28.820]   "And we preach to you good news of the promise made of the Father, that God has fulfilled this promise to our children, and in that he raised up Jesus."
[01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:32.820]   And it is also written in the second Psalm, "You are my son. Today I have begotten you."
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:39.820]   So all of this was a fulfillment. So when he says to fulfill all righteousness is to fulfill God's promise that he was going to come.
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:48.820]   But that specific promise of Jesus coming and being baptized and the Holy Spirit descending upon him is mentioned again in Isaiah 42 verses 1-3.
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:57.820]   And this is what it says, "Behold my servant whom I behold, and I uphold my chosen one in whom my soul delights.
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:03.820]   I have put my spirit upon him. He will bring forth justice to the nations.
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:14.820]   He will not cry out or raise his voice, nor make his voice heard in the street. A bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not extinguish."
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:27.820]   Do you notice here, do you notice here the paradox of how John said when Jesus comes that he is going to baptize with the Holy Spirit and of what? Fire.
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:34.820]   And then he said his winnowing fork is in his hand in order to separate the wheat and the chaff.
[01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:40.820]   That he's going to reward and he's going to judge. He's going to bring fire by the Holy Spirit.
[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:45.820]   But when the Holy Spirit descends upon him, how does the Holy Spirit descend upon him?
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:53.820]   How does the Holy Spirit descend upon him? Fire? No. A dove.
[01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:59.820]   It comes in the form of a dove, like a dove, and lands on him and stays on him.
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:05.820]   I mean, if you were paying attention, you'd say, "Well, I thought the Holy Spirit was going to bring fire. I thought he was going to bring judgment.
[01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:08.820]   I thought he was going to separate."
[01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:13.820]   But when the Holy Spirit actually comes, he comes in peace.
[01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:19.820]   The Bible tells us the reason why Christ has not come is because he is patient.
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:23.820]   That the full number of the elect would come in.
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:28.820]   He's being patient because you and I right now are living in a time of grace.
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:34.820]   Revelation is coming. The judgment is coming. The winnowing fork is coming.
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:44.820]   But you and I right now are living in a time of grace where God is being patient, where the gospel is being preached, where Christ comes in the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove.
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:48.820]   To invite us, invite the sinners to come to him.
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:56.820]   We see the same scene in the book of Revelation chapter 5, where all the seals of the books of life, no one could open.
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:03.820]   So everybody is crying and weeping. Nobody is worthy to open this up. Who will deliver us from this?
[01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:12.820]   And they say, "Do not worry. The Lion of Judah has overcome. He is worthy. He will come and open up these seals."
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:16.820]   So it stirs them up into hope. The Lion of Judah is coming.
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:20.820]   And so when they turn to look for the Lion of Judah, what's there?
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:24.820]   The Lamb of God. The Lamb of God slain for our sins.
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:33.820]   They turned around looking for the Lion of Judah, and it was the Lamb of God who came slain for our sins.
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:43.820]   Mark 10, 45, it says, "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many."
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:48.820]   Who has loved you like this?
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:50.820]   Who has loved you like this?
[01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:55.820]   And you could say, "My mom, my dad, my wife, my husband."
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:57.820]   But like this?
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:12:01.820]   Who is capable of loving you like this?
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:06.820]   Who is willing to love you like this?
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:11.820]   The love of Christ compels us to worship Him.
[01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:14.820]   It's the love of Christ that compels us to follow Him.
[01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:21.820]   It's the love of Christ that compels us to put away our sins.
[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:29.820]   You know, there's a tendency when you're around proud people, you become proud.
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:34.820]   You become proud because they're one-upping you, so you feel the need to one-up them.
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:40.820]   "I did this." "Oh, me too. I did this." "Yeah, but I did this." "No, but I did that."
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:47.820]   We have a tendency when you're around humble people that we also become humble.
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:50.820]   God has a tendency to humble us.
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:13:00.820]   When we're around Christ, when we're around the true Christ of the Bible, He humbles us because He humbled Himself.
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:06.820]   And if you ever see a man who is proud, who's eager to tell you their accomplishments,
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:12.820]   I don't care how articulate they are, I don't care how smart they sound, they're not near Christ.
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:19.820]   A man who is near Christ is always humble. That's been my experience.
[01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:27.820]   You know, this week I got to spend some time with Pastor Lee from, not Dropbox, from Baby Box.
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:31.820]   I keep mixing that up.
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:40.820]   It's strange, but I've been praying. Esther knows. I've been praying, "Lord, I want to meet somebody that really seems to know Christ and love Christ."
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:45.820]   It's not that it doesn't exist. I want somebody who's gone before me.
[01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:50.820]   I've been praying, and I've even asked people, "If I go here, is there somebody that I can meet?"
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:54.820]   Just this fellowship and just to be challenged and encouraged by.
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:14:04.820]   Well, to be honest, I was sitting in front of this man who suffered so much, and God has anointed this man.
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:11.820]   Things were coming out of his mouth, and I remember just sitting there mesmerized.
[01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:19.820]   I was trying to be careful that I don't look like a weirdo, because he was talking, and I'm like, "What?"
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:25.820]   But I felt like everything that was coming out of my mouth was like, "This is what Jesus would say.
[01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:30.820]   This is what Jesus would feel. This is what Jesus would do."
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:33.820]   The whole time I was just thinking, "Wow, this man."
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:39.820]   It didn't come from his learning. It didn't come from years of experience. It came from suffering in his life.
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:50.820]   Thirty-five years of taking care of a child that would have been abandoned without a second thought for the majority of the people, even Christians,
[01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:54.820]   because of the suffering that would come along with taking care of this child.
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:15:01.820]   Fourteen years, had to quit living at the hospital, and it just, you know, because he was faithful and because he chose to love his son.
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:09.820]   And people started, "Wow, this man." Like, people, like even a chance of Down syndrome, they say, "Oh, you need to abort this child."
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:15.820]   But to have a child that can't even sit up and was bedridden and fourteen years dedicated,
[01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:19.820]   and then adopting other children who were like that to take care of him.
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:24.820]   At one point, he had thirteen children that he had to take care of. This was before there was any funding, anybody else.
[01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:26.820]   Just him and his wife.
[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:31.820]   And they asked him, like, "Wasn't that hard?" He says, "Of course it was hard."
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:35.820]   And he said, "But I saw Jesus in their face."
[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:42.820]   And he said, "God showed me through them who he is."
[01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:50.820]   This love for these children didn't come from just anywhere. He wasn't born with this love.
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:55.820]   It's because he walked in their shoes with his own son.
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:16:00.820]   It's because he was there suffering, because he loved his child,
[01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:04.820]   that that grew into love for the other children.
[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:12.820]   Unimaginable. I mean, I think every single one of us. Unimaginable to take care of one child that way.
[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:19.820]   Thirteen children, volunteered, and now people in the neighborhood are just dropping them off at their feet.
[01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:24.820]   And so the whole Dropbox ministry happened because they were just dropping the kids off in his front,
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:28.820]   in the cold sometimes. And so in order to protect these children that they're dropping off,
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:31.820]   he made that box, "Please put them here so they don't freeze to death."
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:34.820]   That's why that Dropbox happened. It wasn't because he was trying to start a ministry.
[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:36.820]   It just happened to protect these kids.
[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:42.820]   And then people heard about this, and you're going to see the movie, so I don't want to ruin all of this for you.
[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:46.820]   People just heard about this, and people started coming, non-Christians started coming.
[01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:50.820]   Like, "How? Why is this so important? Why are you taking care of these abandoned kids?
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:53.820]   Why are you sacrificing your life to do all of this?"
[01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:57.820]   And so they made the movie. They made the Dropbox movie.
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:00.820]   He didn't say, "Hey, we should tell the world about this."
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:07.820]   It just happened because they were so amazed by this man's sacrifice and suffering.
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:11.820]   And as a result of that, this country, this South Korean country,
[01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:19.820]   whose abortion is like nothing for years, even among Christians.
[01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:25.820]   They don't think twice about it. But because they see the love for abandoned children,
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:29.820]   because of this one man and his wife, people started changing their paradigm.
[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:38.820]   Why is it so precious to him? And why are we so flippant about getting rid of these children?
[01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:47.820]   So non-Christians and Christians alike are starting to change their paradigm of their selfishness.
[01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:55.820]   And how they didn't value life. Not because he was in the street corner condemning everybody.
[01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:59.820]   Not because he was saying these things and saying, "Oh, why are you doing this?"
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:04.820]   Because of his love. Because of his sacrifice.
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:09.820]   People are being drawn, non-Christians. And even, you know, you saw the film crew that was here?
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:14.820]   They weren't Christians. They just want to highlight his life.
[01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:19.820]   And the people who made the Dropbox movie, they're not Christians either.
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:22.820]   They just made it because they're just amazed by what he was doing.
[01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:26.820]   Again, I'm not going to ruin it for you. You can go see it next week.
[01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:34.820]   He didn't just get that. It's because he obeyed.
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:41.820]   And he walked in their shoes. And God, because he was faithful to the little,
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:46.820]   God began to open up. And then open up. And open up.
[01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:52.820]   You know what's really interesting was, this is a man who's traveled the world.
[01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:57.820]   You have dignitaries, governors, mayors, who are contacting him because they want to talk to him.
[01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:03.820]   They want to sit with him. But you could tell they have no idea what they're doing.
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:09.820]   They're like, "I don't know how to pass this check."
[01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:14.820]   You know, and he's like, "A hotel in Santa Ana, that's where the drug dealing happens."
[01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:18.820]   And he's like, "Oh, okay. We'll just move over here."
[01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:25.820]   But the amazing thing about all of that is, this guy is like, they made a film about him.
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:28.820]   He's meeting dignitaries, celebrities are coming, wanting to talk to him.
[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:32.820]   And he doesn't know how to cash this check. You know?
[01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:38.820]   Because he didn't plan this. He didn't envision this.
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:42.820]   He didn't love his child and those other children.
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:47.820]   He didn't adopt them because he was thinking that this was going to lead to something.
[01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:52.820]   He simply obeyed. He simply submitted.
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:56.820]   And as a result of that, you see the hand of God on him.
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:20:01.820]   And God is moving him. God is opening the doors.
[01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:04.820]   People are giving him money that he's not even asking for.
[01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:07.820]   Because they see the hand of God on this man.
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:11.820]   Man, it was humbling.
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:15.820]   That's what Jesus called us to do.
[01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:18.820]   That's what Jesus called us to do.
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:24.820]   Not to be smart, not to be clever, not to be well-read, not to be disciplined.
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:28.820]   And all those things are important things.
[01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:31.820]   But be like a child.
[01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:35.820]   Listen to him. Follow him.
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:40.820]   And obey him. And let him take care of the rest.
[01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:47.820]   Jesus was baptized to fulfill all righteousness.
[01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:52.820]   I pray that you and I would understand.
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:59.820]   And all this religious--again, I'm the leader of this church.
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:05.820]   So a lot of this religiousness is my fault.
[01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:10.820]   But Jesus is real.
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:13.820]   He's real.
[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:16.820]   We're not playing a game.
[01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:19.820]   The word of God is his word.
[01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:22.820]   Jesus actually came.
[01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:25.820]   He walked this earth.
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:28.820]   He actually died for us.
[01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:30.820]   And he is interceding for us.
[01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:31.820]   And he is waiting for us.
[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:33.820]   And he is inviting us.
[01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:34.820]   Come alongside.
[01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:36.820]   Pick up your cross.
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:38.820]   Deny yourself.
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:40.820]   And follow him too.
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:42.820]   And know the joy.
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:48.820]   Know the joy that he promised to all those who find true life in him.
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:56.820]   Let's pray.
[01:21:56.820 --> 01:22:02.820]   Gracious and loving father,
[01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:05.820]   we believe.
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.820]   Help our unbelief.
[01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:10.820]   Open our eyes.
[01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:14.820]   Help us to know that you are real.
[01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:16.820]   That you answer our prayers.
[01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:22.820]   That your promises are worth giving our life for.
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:27.820]   We pray, father God, that you would help us with all the saints
[01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:31.820]   to come to know more and more each day, each week, each year,
[01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:35.820]   the depth, the height, the width, and the length of the love of Christ,
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:39.820]   that our worship would not be under compulsion,
[01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:43.820]   but an overflow of joy that you've given us.
[01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:45.820]   We love you, Lord.
[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:49.820]   Help us, Lord God, to love you more.
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:52.820]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:54.820]   If you can all stand up with me,
[01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:56.820]   and the worship team is going to lead us in worship,
[01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:59.820]   and then we will lead -- I will lead you in the time of communion
[01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:02.820]   together afterwards, okay?
[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:16.820]   [Music]
[01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:26.820]   Behold the Lamb who bears our sins away, slain for us.
[01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:35.820]   And we remember the promise made that all who come in faith
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:42.820]   find forgiveness at the cross.
[01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:55.820]   So we share in this bread of life, and we drink of its sacrifice
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:24:20.820]   as a sign of our bond of peace around the table of the King.
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:30.820]   The body of our Savior Jesus Christ, torn from all.
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:39.820]   Eat and remember the wounds that healed, the death that brings us life,
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:46.820]   paid the price to make us one.
[01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:59.820]   So we share in this bread of life, and we drink of its sacrifice
[01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:27.820]   as a sign of our bond of love around the table of the King.
[01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:31.820]   If you now take the communion cup,
[01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:37.820]   again I want to remind you this is for the baptized believers in the church,
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:40.820]   and if you have not, and you have not confessed your sins,
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:43.820]   we ask that -- there's no secret power to this,
[01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:46.820]   it's a remembrance of what Christ has already done for us.
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:52.820]   And so if you are here as a guest, we ask that you would not participate in that,
[01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:55.820]   but just be mindful and prayerful about what we're doing
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:57.820]   and the meaning behind all of this.
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:59.820]   But for those of you who are participating,
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:02.820]   if you can open it up and have both of them things out,
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:05.820]   and we will participate in it together.
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:11.820]   And so let me read in 1 Corinthians 11, 23 and on it says,
[01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:15.820]   "For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you,
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:19.820]   that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread.
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:21.820]   And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:25.820]   'This is my body which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.'
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:28.820]   In the same way he took the cup also after supper, saying,
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:30.820]   'This cup is a new covenant in my blood;
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:33.820]   do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:36.820]   For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:40.820]   you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.'"
[01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:42.820]   Let's participate together.
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:56.820]   [Silence]
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:27:13.820]   [Music]
[01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:15.820]   Sing it right here.
[01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:20.820]   I hear the Savior say,
[01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:25.820]   "Thy strength indeed is small.
[01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:30.820]   Child of weakness, watch and pray.
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:35.820]   Find in me thine all in all.
[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:40.820]   Jesus paid it all,
[01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:45.820]   all to him I owe.
[01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:49.820]   Sin had left a crimson stain,
[01:27:49.820 --> 01:28:00.820]   it washed it white as snow.
[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:05.820]   Lord, now indeed I find
[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:10.820]   thy power and thine alone.
[01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:14.820]   And change the leper's spots
[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:19.820]   and melt the heart of Jesus.
[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:24.820]   Jesus paid it all,
[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:29.820]   all to him I owe.
[01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:33.820]   Sin had left a crimson stain,
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:42.820]   it washed it white as snow.
[01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:49.820]   When before the throne
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:54.820]   I stood in complaint,
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:58.820]   Jesus died my soul to save.
[01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:02.820]   My lips shall still receive
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:08.820]   Jesus paid it all,
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:13.820]   all to him I owe.
[01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:17.820]   Sin had left a crimson stain,
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:23.820]   it washed it white as snow.
[01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:27.820]   Jesus paid it all,
[01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:32.820]   all to him I owe.
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:36.820]   Sin had left a crimson stain,
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:41.820]   it washed it white as snow.
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:45.820]   It washed it white as snow.
[01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:50.820]   It washed it white as snow.
[01:29:50.820 --> 01:30:06.820]   (instrumental)
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:11.820]   Oh, praise the one who paid my debt
[01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:16.820]   and raised this life up from the dead.
[01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:21.820]   Oh, praise the one who paid my debt
[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:26.820]   and raised this life up from the dead.
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:31.820]   Oh, praise the one who paid my debt
[01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:35.820]   and raised this life up from the dead.
[01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:40.820]   Oh, praise the one who paid my debt
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:47.820]   and raised this life up from the dead.
[01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:52.820]   Jesus paid it all,
[01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:57.820]   all to him I owe.
[01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:01.820]   Sin had left a crimson stain,
[01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:08.820]   it washed it white as snow.
[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:11.820]   (instrumental)
[01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:14.820]   - Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:19.820]   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:23.820]   and the love of God that transcends all understanding
[01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:29.820]   compel us, remind us, rebuke us,
[01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:33.820]   encourage us, and strengthen us
[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:36.820]   that we may be the aroma of Christ
[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:39.820]   wherever God sends us.
[01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:40.820]   Amen.
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:41.820]   (instrumental)
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:46.820]   God sent his Son.
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:51.820]   They called him Jesus.
[01:31:51.820 --> 01:31:56.820]   He came to love.
[01:31:56.820 --> 01:32:02.820]   He'll lend for you.
[01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:07.820]   He lived and died
[01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:12.820]   to buy my pardon.
[01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:22.820]   An empty grave is there to hold my Savior there.
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:32.820]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:42.820]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:32:42.820 --> 01:32:52.820]   Because I know he holds the future
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:33:03.820]   and life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:08.820]   Amen.
[01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:15.820]   Jesus, the name above every other name.
[01:33:15.820 --> 01:33:22.820]   Jesus, the only one who could ever save.
[01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:27.820]   Worthy of every prayer he could ever give.
[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:30.820]   We live for you.
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:33.820]   Oh, we live for you.
[01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:36.820]   Holy, holy.
[01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:40.820]   There is no one like you.
[01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:43.820]   There is none besides you.
[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:44.820]   Oh.
