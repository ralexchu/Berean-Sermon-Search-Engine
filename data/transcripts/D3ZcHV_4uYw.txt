[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   We're really excited to have our next speaker here. Nate Silver is the editor-in-chief of FiveThirtyEight.
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.240]   And he
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.540]   came to our poker game recently. Oh, Nate came to our game. Come on out, Nate. Ran the game over.
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.540]   [Applause]
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.540]   See you, brother. Good morning.
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.540]   [Applause]
[00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.540]   Who was the big loser that night?
[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.540]   I think... Wait, who was the big loser?
[00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.540]   'Cause Nate was the big winner, right?
[00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.540]   He was the big winner. I was basically trying to break even.
[00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.540]   I think Jason's here. Jason, you were the big loser that night?
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.540]   I think I donated a little bit to Nate Silver's new Model S Plaid.
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.540]   Model Y Model S Plaid.
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.540]   I think he got the Model S Plaid coming for the game.
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.540]   This was the largest poker win you've had in your life.
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.540]   Largest cash game win, yeah.
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.540]   By a factor of five?
[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.540]   Two. Two, okay.
[00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.540]   Well, we're happy to donate.
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.540]   You're getting... By the way, your speaker fee, I just canceled it.
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.540]   Okay. [Laughter]
[00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.540]   But, ladies and gentlemen, Nate Silver on The Mind of a Gambler.
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.540]   Cool.
[00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.540]   [Applause]
[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:17.540]   [Music]
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.540]   I'm really excited to talk to you all today.
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.540]   I'm working on a book about gambling, risk, and rationality.
[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.540]   I prefer the term critical thinking to rationality.
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.540]   It's partly involved talking to people about global societal risks.
[00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.540]   So, talking to people about the risk of nuclear war,
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.540]   which is not very cheery conversations, by the way.
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.540]   But also people who take risk for a living, or at the very least,
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.540]   manage risk and have real skin in the game.
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.540]   They're not just some actuary getting a salary.
[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.540]   They're assessing risk and making big decisions,
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.540]   financially mostly based on that assessment.
[00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.540]   So, I've started out talking to poker players and sports bettors.
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.540]   I'm a former poker player myself.
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.540]   I still play recreationally a lot.
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.540]   I'm currently, I think, number 301 in the global poker rankings.
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.540]   Not that I look that up every morning. [Laughter]
[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.540]   But mostly it's the example of talking to other fantastic poker players
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.540]   and sports bettors about their process.
[00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.540]   And I'm also talking now more to VCs, to founders,
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.540]   to hedge fund managers, for example.
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.540]   There are a lot of similarities.
[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.540]   There's a certain type of person. That's what I'm talking about today.
[00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.540]   Personality traits, modes of thinking.
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.540]   It even affects maybe their political views a little bit.
[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.540]   And you see a lot of things in common.
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.540]   So, I gave you some of this context already.
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.540]   This is a work in progress.
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.540]   I mean, the book is kind of halfway, 0% written, about 50% research.
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.540]   So, things may change.
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.540]   I'm evolving and learning and correcting things.
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.540]   But it's fun to write a book.
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.540]   It's fun to have great conversations with the besties and other people
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.540]   and really kind of experience this firsthand.
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.540]   So, I'm going to start with some things that I think are relatively straightforward
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.540]   and obvious and then get into things that are maybe less so toward the end.
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.540]   But one really obvious one is that successful gamblers think probabilistically.
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.540]   It's not just a matter of understanding probability,
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.540]   but being comfortable with uncertainty,
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.540]   being willing to take bets on an uncertain basis.
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.540]   That's kind of table stakes for even getting into any field involving risk.
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.540]   In poker, at least, you probably also need a fair amount of mathematical ability.
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.540]   There are now these things called solvers in poker
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.540]   that come up with a game theory optimal strategy for every situation.
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.540]   It's a very complex situation.
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.540]   It's way too hard to memorize.
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.540]   You have to kind of develop a mathematical intuition behind it.
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.540]   But even players with rare exception, Phil Hellmuth might be the one exception actually, right?
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.540]   But even players who are known as being field players or exploitive players,
[00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.540]   people who rely on tells and psychology and table talk.
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.540]   I talked to Daniel Negreanu, for example, one of the probably five best poker players of all time.
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.540]   And he told me that about four years ago, he realized that these solver kids, as he calls them,
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.540]   the math whizzes were better than him, at least at certain forms of poker.
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.540]   And he totally remade his game to look at computer solutions,
[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.540]   to be more studious and mathematical, and it's improved his results quite a bit.
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.540]   In the VC field, I don't know if you're necessarily doing as much modeling
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.540]   as I might in an election model, for example, but at the very least, people understand the intuition.
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.540]   And the intuition is, you need both, but I think the intuition is more important than the application.
[00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.540]   Number two, this one ought to be really obvious, but it needs to be said.
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.540]   Successful gamblers are highly competitive.
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.540]   Things that you hear from people over and over again is, "I want to kind of prove people wrong.
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.540]   I want to outsmart the competition.
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.540]   I want to show who's best."
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.540]   It's almost more of this motivation than financial motivation, I think.
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.540]   It's partly a matter of, you can't settle for being average as a gambler.
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.540]   The average poker player loses money to the house, so does the average sports player,
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.540]   so therefore, you have to deviate from average in some ways.
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:04.540]   But kind of one conclusion I've come to talking to people in this book is that human beings are a competitive species.
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.540]   To get people to get along in society is pretty hard.
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.540]   One good thing about capitalism is that you have some managed type of competition.
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:19.540]   Democracy is kind of a type of competition, and that's probably a better way to kind of challenge these conflicting urges we have
[00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.540]   than things that are too centrally planned.
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.540]   But certainly people in this room, people I talk to, are on the high end of the competitive scale.
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.540]   Successful poker players and sports bettors have to care a lot about small edges.
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.540]   It's the nature of placing bets in a field where you lose money on average.
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:42.540]   So a very good sports bettor might win 55 or so percent of his or her bets.
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:49.540]   You have to win 52.5% to make up for the house cut, for the rake or the vig, as different names.
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.540]   That means you can't afford to make 1% errors, right?
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:00.540]   You really have to squeeze every last drop of expected value or EV out of any situation that you're in.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.540]   This makes people very, very, very detail-oriented.
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.540]   Poker players tend to be very studious about their craft.
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.540]   They really kind of love poker.
[00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.540]   You can't just get the big things right in poker.
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.540]   You have to get the small things right, too.
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.540]   It's too competitive a field right now.
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.540]   This might not be as true, by the way, of VC.
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.540]   The average investment makes money.
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:26.540]   It may not make an above-market return, but it'll make money, which is not true for the average poker hand that you play.
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.540]   By the way, casinos, too, if you talk to casino executives,
[00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:35.540]   you might think you walk into a casino and everything that you do is maximized to make the maximum amount of revenue possible.
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.540]   Not really, right?
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.540]   They're pretty good at the big stuff.
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.540]   They protect their downside risk a lot, but they're not maximized as much as you would think,
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.540]   because when you have a license to make money, you don't have to get the small stuff right.
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:55.540]   But in poker, where only 10% of players probably make money in the long run, you have to be very, very detail-oriented.
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.540]   Number four, you see here a Paul Graham thread about Elon, actually.
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.540]   Successful gamblers are contrarian, at least to some degree.
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:10.540]   And again, I'm kind of repeating myself a little bit, but there's no edge if everyone does the same thing in the same way.
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.540]   You have to have some angle that you think makes you better than what the market thinks,
[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.540]   and the market's pretty good, so it's a hard thing to manage.
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:25.540]   Risk-takers tend to view themselves as outsiders. Whether they are or not is probably an open question.
[00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.540]   What they think of themselves as thinking differently from the rest of the world, potentially.
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:35.540]   This can also make them potentially a little bit annoying, like outside of investing and gambling context, right?
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:43.540]   Where if you're kind of always the person who says, "Well, actually," that can get kind of pushed back in social settings, for example, or on Twitter.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:49.540]   You can't kind of settle for having the average view, because the average view doesn't do better than the market.
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:55.540]   There is a fine line between being ahead of the curve and a permanent contrarian.
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:01.540]   In sports betting, if there's a line that's constantly mispriced, then I can just bet that, and I don't want that market to correct itself.
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.540]   I want to keep exploiting that error in pricing, right?
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.540]   In VC, I mean, you might want to find a founder or a sector or a company that's undervalued by the market,
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:15.540]   but eventually you want that sector to grow. You want to attract more talent.
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.540]   You want to attract future fundraising rounds.
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.540]   So you kind of are more being ahead of the curve by half a year to a year.
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.540]   I think in some ways it's analogous to real estate.
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.540]   We are trying to kind of anticipate where the market will be in the future,
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:35.540]   and that's a subtly different skill than being maybe contrarian per se, but related at least.
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:40.540]   Number five, and again, this might be a little bit redundant, but successful gamblers take shots.
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:47.540]   And this is very intuitive in VC, where you have a field where you might only have a unicorn or decacorn,
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.540]   you know, 1% of the time or 10% of the time.
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.540]   Of course, you have a whole portfolio. It may not be that risky in the aggregate,
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:09:00.540]   but you have to be willing to make decisions under pressure and be somewhat fearless as a result, right?
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.540]   Timing is important. You want to be first to market.
[00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:08.540]   In poker, you have a finite amount of time you can spend on a hand in practice.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.540]   Sometimes people take these risks in a calculated way, right?
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.540]   I talked to Sam Beckman-Fried for the book, for example, and he's like,
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.540]   "Yeah, I knew this would have only a 50% chance of succeeding, but the payoff was so high, I would take it."
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.540]   Some people just kind of more intuitively just kind of want to put skin in the game,
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.540]   want to take risks, get some excitement or pleasure from it.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.540]   Again, we're talking about the very extreme tails here too, right?
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:36.540]   The people who are super uber successful maybe are almost taking on more risk than they maybe should.
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.540]   You can instead likely have a very happy and complacent life as an investment banker or something,
[00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:46.540]   but people who are true entrepreneurs, they think at scale and think very, very big.
[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.540]   I should say one challenge of writing the book is that talking only to successful people,
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:55.540]   you risk survivorship bias, right? So kind of which people fell along by the wayside.
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:00.540]   If you know unsuccessful investors or gamblers, then send them my way.
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.540]   I need to talk to some of them as well.
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:11.540]   Number six, successful gamblers, especially in poker, work well with incomplete information.
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:16.540]   One thing that differentiates people in academia, and academia is very useful for basic research
[00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.540]   and for advancing science and things like that, right?
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:24.540]   But you don't get months and months and years and years to develop a hypothesis
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:29.540]   when there's actual money on the line. By that time, the people who are faster will already have moved.
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:34.540]   So the skill is kind of knowing what information was available at the time you made the decision.
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.540]   I think there is a limit to how useful an after-action review might be
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.540]   if you kind of pretend as though you had perfect hindsight, right?
[00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.540]   We can say, what would we have done about COVID now if we had known all the things we know now about it
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.540]   back in February 2020, and it would be an easier problem to solve.
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.540]   But that's not how the real world works. So decision-making under uncertainty is, I think,
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:58.540]   an understudied and underappreciated topic.
[00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:02.540]   You can't be too much of a control freak, certainly in a game like poker.
[00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:08.540]   You can lose your temper very easily. Emotional management's a big part of people who are successful in these fields.
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.540]   But all the value is in making the hard decisions, right?
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:16.540]   Hard because they're edge cases, hard because you have some information but not others,
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.540]   and you're going to get some things wrong, but otherwise, if it's easy,
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.540]   then everyone else is already going to do it. There's no excess returns to be made.
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:29.540]   I think related to this is that successful gamblers focus on process much more than results.
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:34.540]   One thing I found good for the book and refreshing is people, if you ask them, kind of,
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:38.540]   what makes you tick, what's your advantage, they're quite thoughtful and deliberate about it.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:44.540]   They step back and think about what skills do I possess, what's the bigger kind of problem that I'm trying to solve.
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:48.540]   Again, emotional displacement is a big part of this.
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.540]   I'm not saying that you're supposed to be totally emotionless.
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.540]   I mean, emotion can help to guide intuition, which we'll talk about in a bit.
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:59.540]   But it does mean you have to be willing to lose a poker hand, lose $10,000,
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.540]   and then play the next hand as best as you can, right?
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:11.540]   Or have an investment or many investments that go sour and still be on your best state of mind for making future investments.
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:16.540]   It's pretty hard. Most people aren't very good at this at all.
[00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.540]   You can go too far and sometimes make excuses.
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:23.540]   There are lots of different ways to get unlucky in poker or investing.
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:29.540]   But having that focus on kind of what was my thought process, it seems intuitive for people in this audience maybe,
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.540]   but it's not intuitive for the average person.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:37.540]   It differentiates successful gamblers quite a bit.
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:43.540]   This next slide here, you may have seen this video online where there are a bunch of girls bouncing basketballs.
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.540]   They ask you to count how many times the basketball passed back and forth.
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:55.540]   And during the video, kind of unbeknownst to the watcher, a gorilla walks on stage, like things change colors, weird things happen.
[00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:00.540]   And the point is to try and say, OK, well, you were so focused on counting the number of basketballs being passed
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:05.540]   that you ignored the gorilla in the room, so to speak, right?
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.540]   I think, though, that if you're instructed to count the number of passes,
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.540]   that is actually a sign of intelligence that you do focus on that, right?
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:16.540]   If you're an air traffic controller and you're trying to land planes at Miami Airport
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:20.540]   and you get a bunch of text messages from your teenage daughter, you shouldn't be distracted by that.
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.540]   You should kind of focus on the task at hand.
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:29.540]   But the point is that people have an amazing ability to vary what they're paying attention to, especially in the moment.
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:35.540]   And in poker, this is very important because most of the time, poker is pretty boring, right?
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:40.540]   Good players fold 70 percent of their hands for the most part, right?
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:45.540]   A lot of decisions are fairly automatic, but maybe once an hour or once a day,
[00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:51.540]   you'll have a decision for tens of thousands of dollars or where you'll be knocked out of the tournament or win the tournament, right?
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.540]   And so having that kind of -- knowing where you focus your attention is an underrated skill
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.540]   that I think people who are at least in poker are pretty good at.
[00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:05.540]   By the way, one thing I've noticed is that you used to kind of think of poker players as being kind of quite schlubby and sloppy,
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:11.540]   and some of them still are, but more and more the good players are focusing on physical and mental fitness.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.540]   It is like a demanding game.
[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:21.540]   It's a little bit demanding physically to kind of keep your composure and not give away information from your mental state.
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.540]   And to really concentrate is like actually a lot of work.
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.540]   I mean, there are kind of famous studies of chess players and how Magnus Carlsen will lose, you know,
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:32.540]   five pounds over the course of a chess match just thinking, which might seem ridiculous.
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:38.540]   But if you're really playing poker at your A game, at your A+ game, which you don't achieve very often,
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.540]   I often find that when I am able to do that, rarely, I'm completely wiped out afterward.
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.540]   It is a physically demanding game.
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.540]   But in general, kind of having your ear to the ground, looking out for opportunities,
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:55.540]   and being flexible enough to take advantage of those opportunities is an underrated skill set.
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:59.540]   Number nine, successful gamblers apply practiced intuition.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:07.540]   So I'm 44. One of the things about becoming middle-aged, you start to kind of potentially trust your gut a lot more,
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.540]   which can be risky in some ways.
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.540]   I think people can, in matters that happen only occasionally, like a presidential election,
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:16.540]   people think, well, my gut is that so-and-so will win.
[00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.540]   You don't have enough practice at forecasting elections for that to be very useful.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.540]   We have one election every four years.
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:27.540]   If you're a poker player, though, you're playing tens of thousands of hands every year.
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:32.540]   If you're a VC, you're hearing thousands of pitches every year.
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:38.540]   And part of what experience does is kind of take things that were once hard and then become more automatic.
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:44.540]   I mean, you'll hear people say, oh, I made a decision very quickly, and I make snap decisions.
[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:49.540]   You hear someone give a pitch, and you decide maybe in 30 minutes whether or not to fund them or not.
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.540]   You hear examples like that.
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:57.540]   But that doesn't really reflect the fact that this person has spent years and years and years honing their insight
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.540]   and listening to pitches, and that produces value down the line.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:08.540]   So it's intuition of a sort, but it's practiced, refined, well-calibrated intuition that involves working really hard and learning.
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:13.540]   I mean, in poker, you kind of go through cycles where you kind of are grinding and get better at something.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.540]   You feel like you achieve some condition of mastery.
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:20.540]   Then you kind of slip. You get complacent. Maybe you tilt a little bit.
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:27.540]   Having the ability to step back and reevaluate your game, like Negreanu or someone, and say, look, I have to make some adjustments here.
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:32.540]   Maybe I'm doing play better than I ever have, but now I learn different flaws that I have.
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.540]   My opponents are getting better, too.
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:42.540]   That bottom of this chart here, where you reevaluate and grind back up and expect that you're going to have to keep doing that for your whole life, frankly,
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.540]   differentiates successful people, I think.
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:51.540]   Number 10, this is one of the more subtle ones, I think, but successful gamblers are structured thinkers.
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.540]   They want to understand the process behind the outcome.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:02.540]   Again, in poker, it's too complex a game just to purely learn through memorization and rote skill, right?
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:07.540]   You want to understand how things adapt, what the underlying kind of curvatures are and everything.
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:11.540]   Heuristics or rules of thumb are pretty useful, right?
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:16.540]   Like in poker, a heuristic might be that you should call with your medium-strength hands, right?
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:20.540]   Your best hands, you raise. Your worst hands, you fold or check, right?
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:25.540]   And then you kind of call with your medium-strength hands, but there are exceptions to that, and heuristics only go so far.
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:33.540]   But the kind of flip side of this is, like, so at this conference, there's a lot of talk about investing and gambling, but also politics.
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:40.540]   I do think when you're kind of a highly structured philosophical thinker that politics is very frustrating, right?
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:45.540]   People in the other world I work in, which is, you know, I run a website, I talk to people in politics,
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.540]   talk to academics who are trying to get on to see TV and stuff like that, right?
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:54.540]   It's a lot of very hypocritical and ad hoc thinking in politics, right?
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:59.540]   It's instrumental reasoning toward trying to win an argument at that moment in that day.
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:06.540]   And so you can see why someone like Elon Musk might get very fed up with the kind of hypocritical nature of political discourse.
[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:13.540]   That's another conversation we might have in the Q&A, but it does lead to some personality clashes, I think.
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:18.540]   The last one here, which is maybe a little bit counterintuitive, but I've kind of learned, I think, from observation,
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:24.540]   is that the most successful gamblers don't actually care that much about money.
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.540]   You know, they tend to be, for the most part, very generous.
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:33.540]   They're always going to pick up the tab. They're going to spend a lot on good wine and things like that, right?
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:39.540]   So they're in it really for the love of the game, and when they get bored, they tend to quit.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:46.540]   Again, this might differentiate the 0.01% or 0.001% from like the 1%.
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.540]   Certainly, you want to manage your money carefully in poker, but still,
[00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.540]   when you have people whose net worth fluctuates by the amount that poker players does,
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.540]   like in poker, it's basically like, you know, three states, right?
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:01.540]   Super rich, somewhat rich, and dead broke, like not a lot in between.
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:06.540]   When that's the nature of your field, and you've been in those states for different parts of your life,
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.540]   and many good poker players have had periods where they're broke,
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:14.540]   you tend to recognize the ephemeral nature of success and to celebrate life in the moment a bit more.
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.540]   So that's all. Thank you very much. Look forward to the Q&A now.
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:23.540]   [applause]
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.540]   Ladies and gentlemen, Nate Silver.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.540]   I don't know if there--was this in the introduction that you run 538?
[00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.540]   Like, does everyone know the site?
[00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:35.540]   So, like, during the election cycle, Nate does the best job of anyone on earth,
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:40.540]   gathering together polling data, and then using statistical models to represent
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:45.540]   a distribution or a set of expected outcomes, and making that known on his site
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.540]   in a way that's super, I think, informative, better than anything else that's out there.
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.540]   So, thanks for that. Now, I get really addicted to them leading up to elections.
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.540]   I'm like, I've got to go in and check what Nate's changed on the site every day,
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.540]   and I know a lot of people did.
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:01.540]   Then what I observed on Twitter, which I think speaks to your first point here,
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:05.540]   was a lot of people followed your prediction on the Trump election, right?
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:09.540]   And they're like, Nate made a prediction that Trump was going to win,
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.540]   but what you said was that there was a 43% chance that Trump would win,
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.540]   and therefore people assumed he was going to lose,
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.540]   and that the nature of a lot of people's understanding of things is very deterministic and binary.
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:25.540]   It's like win or lose, as opposed to, hey, the future is not binary.
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.540]   The future is not deterministic. There's a set of outcomes that may occur,
[00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:31.540]   and you can get a better sense of what that set is.
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.540]   You make that determination enough times, you'll be right most of the time,
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.540]   you'll be wrong some of the time.
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:40.540]   Do you think most-- so my question for you, based on how I saw people react negatively
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.540]   to your polling, which was crazy, because it was like,
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.540]   dude, he gave a really good set of statistical models.
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.540]   No, people blamed you.
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.540]   But my question is, do people have the ability to think probabilistically?
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.540]   Because you say you need to think probabilistically, or is that a minority of people
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.540]   that can really get themselves there?
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.540]   Because so many people just want a yes or no answer.
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.540]   They want to say, this is the future, this isn't.
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.540]   They don't want to think about a distribution of outcomes,
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.540]   which is really the way the world works.
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.540]   I think people think probabilistically all the time in real life.
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.540]   If you're running late for a meeting, you have to decide, should I speed?
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.540]   What's the risk of getting into an accident?
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.540]   What's the risk of getting pulled over, or things like that?
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.540]   They don't realize they're doing that.
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.540]   Yeah, they don't know they're doing that.
[00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:27.540]   I think part of the answer is that I think politics kind of breaks people's brain.
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:32.540]   Because before the 2016 election, we got a lot of criticism from liberals
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.540]   for being too bullish on Trump.
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:39.540]   The market price was about 15%. We have it at 30%.
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.540]   So we were very bullish on Trump relative to other people,
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:46.540]   but people thought we were playing with the numbers to try to, I don't know,
[00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:50.540]   affect turnout somehow, or try to cover our asses, or things like that.
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:56.540]   So I just don't think that politics teaches people to think critically.
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.540]   And it's like, yeah, part of that is they're not thinking probabilistically,
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:03.540]   but it's more like people just want to see their priors confirmed.
[00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:08.540]   What was it like when people blamed you for Trump winning?
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.540]   Yeah, there was a lot of that.
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.540]   And why did you pick Trump as president?
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.540]   I think they pointed to you and basically said, "You tipped the election."
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.540]   It's almost as if you convinced people to go and...
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.540]   How did you deal with that?
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.540]   You just kind of have to say, "Fuck you," and move on with your life.
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:32.540]   I've been very lucky in my life overall, including things that I think are not that remarkable.
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:37.540]   Saying, "Oh, the polls are going to be right," usually, which they were in 2008 and 2012,
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.540]   I think we got way too much credit for that.
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.540]   Again, we're all poker players here.
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:46.540]   So it's kind of like if you get your money in really good,
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:51.540]   and you make a flush or something, you kind of have to have that attitude about it.
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:55.540]   So you were able to just basically shut it out and say, "This..."
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.540]   And what about just the fact that you live inside of an organization,
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.540]   now 538 is owned by ABC?
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.540]   ABC News, yeah.
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.540]   Was that before the election?
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:11.540]   We were ESPN at the time of the 2016 election, now we're ABC News currently.
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.540]   So does that change?
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.540]   How do you make sure that you can actually just do your job,
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:23.540]   no matter how unpopular the answer may be or the distribution of outcomes may be?
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.540]   Okay, so why am I working on this book?
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:28.540]   It's partly because I want to diversify away from just...
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:32.540]   First of all, I think forecasting elections is an interesting problem,
[00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.540]   but it's not the most interesting problem.
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:40.540]   But no, I'm not going to spend the rest of my life just being the election forecasting guy.
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:45.540]   You also face disincentives where the downside...
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.540]   We got some elections really right.
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:52.540]   2018 midterm, we nailed perfectly, about as good as you could.
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.540]   And people are like, "Oh, that's nice."
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:59.540]   If you get the 2020 primary, we were very bullish on Joe Biden
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.540]   when people weren't and thought he was going to lose.
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:06.540]   So you don't get a lot of credit, and you do face a lot of downside
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:10.540]   for being actually wrong or perceived to be wrong.
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:15.540]   And so, yeah, I'm not going to spend the rest of my life making election forecasts.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.540]   I hope that's part of the portfolio of things that I do,
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.540]   but I'm interested in a lot of other questions about the world.
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.540]   Nate, what do you think about social markets that are defined about social behavior?
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:27.540]   Like an election, people are going to vote one way or another.
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:31.540]   You then make a prediction, and then that changes the way people vote.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.540]   And the same is true in stock markets.
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.540]   I was going to ask you about your experience in stock markets
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.540]   because people have an assumption about rate hikes.
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:42.540]   The market then reacts to the assumption about rate hikes,
[00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.540]   then the market tanks, and then the Fed is like,
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:48.540]   "Let's change the rate hike system because the market's tanking."
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.540]   How do you think about building probabilistic models
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.540]   that account for social feedback loops
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:57.540]   where the social decision that's made is driven by the forecast you make
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.540]   or by the market making a forecast?
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.540]   I think the evidence is that in two-way elections,
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:05.540]   so a Democrat versus Republican, that there's no clear effect from--
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.540]   and by the way, what we do is a tradition.
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.540]   There's always been horse race media coverage.
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.540]   There's always been polling going back for many years.
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:17.540]   We think our version of it is a little bit more grounded and objective.
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.540]   In two-way races, it's not clear if there's any impact either way.
[00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:24.540]   Where it can have an effect is when you're having a multiple candidate race.
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:30.540]   In 2020, when Elizabeth Warren started to fall behind Bernie Sanders in the polls,
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:36.540]   if you're a left-wing voter who prefers Warren to Sanders but Sanders to Biden,
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.540]   you may switch your vote as a result of the poll.
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.540]   That can create momentum.
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:45.540]   Mathematically, trying to model a multi-way election, we do it.
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.540]   It's very hard. It's way more complex,
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.540]   in part because of the feedback loops that it introduces, for sure.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.540]   And stock markets are the same?
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:53.540]   Again, I don't--
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.540]   Or any financial market behavior?
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:59.540]   It is funny, by the way, that if I lose $1,000 at poker, I'd be furious,
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:02.540]   but I lose much more than that in the stock market.
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:07.540]   And they're like, "Oh, I don't care. I just invest in low-fee mutual funds and stuff like that."
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:11.540]   For sure. I don't know. You guys would know more than I would,
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:17.540]   but I think there are certainly complexities that involve feedback loops, for sure.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.540]   Nate, we live in a very polarized world right now.
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.540]   We all spend far too much time on Twitter.
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.540]   And we're seeing this sort of house of mirrors.
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:34.540]   I'm curious how the 19% of people who believe in banning abortion
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:39.540]   and their impact and their outsized voice versus the far left
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:44.540]   and their outsized voice with sort of democratic socialism
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:48.540]   affect your ability to predict what's going to happen in the country.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:52.540]   Because the majority of the country's beliefs sometimes are in stark contrast
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:56.540]   to political things that happen.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:02.540]   And even on our podcast, people want to pit Sachs and I as being incredible rivals.
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.540]   No, no, no. You want to pit yourself versus Sachs.
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.540]   Just to be clear.
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:12.540]   In fact, we agree on almost everything, yet it feels like in our society,
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:17.540]   they want to push us to pick very binary belief systems.
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.540]   And I'm just curious how that impacts what you do day to day in your job
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.540]   in predicting what's going to actually happen in reality.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:28.540]   And maybe you could tell us, based on what you've learned over time,
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.540]   are people as polarized as it seems,
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:37.540]   or has America actually got a majority consensus
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.540]   on most of the issues that we struggle with?
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:45.540]   Well, okay. One reason that markets work is because you get feedback in the market, right?
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:49.540]   And you adjust your strategy as a result of negative feedback from consumers,
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.540]   people voting with their feet.
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.540]   I think one problem with Twitter and with the political atmosphere more generally
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:28:01.540]   is that both the left and the right are now insulating themselves from feedback in a lot of ways.
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:05.540]   And if you're someone who tries to call BS,
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.540]   if there's a 12-character, just having a good bullshit detector
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:11.540]   is an implicit theme of people who are successful gamblers, right?
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:15.540]   And if you're someone who's like, "That's kind of bullshit. I can't let that sit there.
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.540]   I have to say something about it, even though it'll piss off my followers,"
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.540]   you really get boundary policed a lot.
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.540]   Totally. Boundary policed, yes.
[00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.540]   Yeah, and when feedback mechanisms are broken,
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.540]   then you run into potentially some really dangerous outcomes, right?
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:34.540]   I think both the left and the right have become more authoritarian in certain ways.
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:39.540]   I think the type of authoritarianism on the right is quite a bit more dangerous in the moment.
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:44.540]   But they're both kind of moving away from kind of liberalism
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.540]   in some kind of classical sense in some ways.
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:51.540]   And I think that has to do with the feedback loops that social media tend to produce.
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:55.540]   The other thing about social media, too, is it really, really flattens things, right?
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:59.540]   One thing that people in Silicon Valley get right,
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:03.540]   for all their faults and self-servingness in some ways, right,
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.540]   they kind of get the orders of magnitudes right.
[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.540]   They understand scale.
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:11.540]   And social media and the daily news cycle really collapses that, right?
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:15.540]   So some extremely important problem and some trivial nonsense
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.540]   are kind of treated on the same level,
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:20.540]   when one is 1,000 times more important than the other.
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:21.540]   And that produces a lot of--
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.540]   Right, in a feed, it's one right after the other.
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:27.540]   Yeah, and again, I don't know if there are ways to redesign Twitter to make that better,
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.540]   but the fact that you're kind of always on, right?
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.540]   I mean, before Twitter, the kind of cable news cycle,
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.540]   you have to have some controversy to talk about,
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.540]   and things are completely dropped the next day there's another news event.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.540]   I mean, sometimes it should be maybe actually this thing was terrible,
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.540]   but this other thing is way more important,
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.540]   and so we should continue to focus on that.
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.540]   So that's damaging, I think.
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.540]   Is there a way out of this?
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.540]   Will this pass in your estimation?
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:54.540]   Is this an intractable problem?
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:58.540]   I'm a little bit bearish in--
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.540]   Concerned.
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.540]   --in the short term, yeah, to be honest.
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.540]   Can you say more? What does that mean?
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.540]   I mean, there are different types of risks that we face, right?
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:12.540]   I mean, one problem in particular is that if we have a close election next time,
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:16.540]   particularly one that's close where the Democrat appears to narrowly win, right?
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:19.540]   I mean, you're having more and more Republican elected officials,
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:22.540]   secretaries of state, some of the candidates in Pennsylvania for governor, for example,
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:26.540]   who kind of believe the election was stolen in 2020,
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:31.540]   which it wasn't, to be clear, and that's a very dangerous argument to have.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.540]   It may not resolve itself at the end of democracy,
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:39.540]   but that's like a risk that's in the 10% range
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:43.540]   that we're maybe higher of a severe constitutional crisis in 2024
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.540]   and maybe repeated that in 2028 and so forth.
[00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:49.540]   And so, I mean, that's the, I think, the most immediate threat,
[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:55.540]   but also kind of government capacity to deal with big problems, right?
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.540]   I don't necessarily take the standard line about COVID where you say,
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.540]   oh, we should have done this and that and managed it more top-down more,
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:05.540]   but clearly like state capacity seemed to be not so great, right?
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:10.540]   As we deal with other existential risks from climate change to AI potentially
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:15.540]   to nuclear threats, you know, I'm a little bit bearish about state capacity.
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:20.540]   To make good decisions in complex situations with not perfect information.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:25.540]   Yeah. You know, and frankly, like being down in Miami, you know,
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.540]   or traveling to other parts of the world, you see like there's more reason to be optimistic, right?
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:33.540]   Where people at least are excited and dynamic and there's something happening.
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:38.540]   It may not be exactly the right thing, but people are happy.
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:41.540]   But no, I think, I don't know, I'm usually an optimistic person
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.540]   and I'm a little bit worried about--
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:47.540]   What should we expect then going into the 2020 midterms?
[00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.540]   - 2022 midterms. - 2022 midterms.
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.540]   So the baseline is pretty strong, which is that the president's party
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.540]   loses seats the large majority of the time.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.540]   And given that Democrats' majorities are so narrow,
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:03.540]   they're pretty big underdogs to keep both the House and the Senate.
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:08.540]   With that said, in Senate races in particular, individual candidates do matter to some extent.
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:12.540]   And you might have enough off-the-wall GOP candidates nominated
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:16.540]   that would cost them two or three seats potentially,
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.540]   and that might be enough to save Democrats.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:21.540]   In the Senate, the House, where the candidates are more anonymous
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:25.540]   and there are more seats in play, is a little bit tougher.
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:29.540]   I do think something like Roe v. Wade is important.
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.540]   Democrats talk a lot about Republican extremism, but a lot of it is theoretical.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:36.540]   It's saying, well, what will happen in 2024 will be this or that.
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:41.540]   This is the kind of rare example of big social change by the opposition party.
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.540]   And that could, I think, motivate Democrats a little bit.
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:48.540]   But midterm elections are more predictable than presidential elections.
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:53.540]   And the base case is that you wind up with Republican majorities of some magnitude.
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:57.540]   - Zach, any thoughts on Nate's handicapping of the situation
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:01.540]   and description of the political climate we're in?
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:07.540]   - Well, I mean, pretty clearly, the Republicans are expected to have big pickups in this midterm, right?
[00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:14.540]   I mean, I agree with you. The Senate is tougher for the GOP because there aren't that many.
[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:18.540]   Most of the at-risk seats are on the Republican side, right, not the Democratic side.
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:23.540]   - Yeah, I mean, there are also seats like Pennsylvania that the GOP held and could lose potentially.
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:27.540]   But you have like, I mean, I don't know how technical you want to get.
[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:31.540]   If you have a generic ballot that favors Republicans by like two points,
[00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.540]   the Democrats can probably keep the Senate.
[00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:38.540]   If it gets to like six points or seven points, then the wall topples.
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:42.540]   And like there's just too many forces going the other way. And so, yeah.
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:46.540]   - So where is it right now? Are you looking at that?
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:52.540]   - Right now it's two or three. However, that's among registered voters and doesn't reflect voter enthusiasm.
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:57.540]   So typically, the challenger party is more motivated to turn out.
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.540]   You saw that in states like Virginia last year.
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:06.540]   That gap seems to be closing a little bit.
[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:11.540]   I do think some of the anti-abortion legislation, right,
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:19.540]   some of the fact that the GOP kind of is now back on offense, on culture wars against LGBT people, right,
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:26.540]   I think potentially is going to help motivate Democrats to turn out, right?
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:30.540]   It wasn't the stuff in Virginia where they were talking about, oh, schools and kind of,
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:36.540]   I mean, you always want to like play counterattack in politics, right?
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:40.540]   And Republicans found some effective counterattacks with respect to educational policy,
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:47.540]   certain attitudes where kind of very left-wing ideas have crept into discussions of education and race and other things, right?
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:54.540]   But now they're like kind of calling like gay and lesbian people and trans people pedophiles and stuff like that, right?
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:59.540]   And that's like surprisingly mainstream discourse. And like it's not, I don't think, politically wise.
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:05.540]   It's also a little bit dangerous in terms of potentially, you know, triggering violence and things like that.
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:10.540]   So I don't know. I mean, neither party can really like help itself, I don't think,
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:15.540]   and kind of being like the worst version of itself.
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:22.540]   Right. Yeah, it's interesting. But Yunkin is an interesting case because one year after Biden won that state by 10,
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:30.540]   Yunkin wins that race by two or three. So it was a 12-point swing in one year.
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:36.540]   How emblematic is that of how quickly the mood of the country has changed?
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:40.540]   Is it like a one-off because Yunkin was a strong candidate against a weak candidate?
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:45.540]   Or does it represent, you know, a much stronger generic Republican ballot?
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:52.540]   I think it's, I mean, that's what you might get if you had 50 Glenn Yunkins running for Senate, right?
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:59.540]   He clearly, I mean, there's usually a pretty big midterm shift, but that was a little bigger than normal in Virginia.
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:02.540]   And that reflects the fact that, I mean, you can like model it out mathematically.
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.540]   We have lots of data points. We have 35 Senate races every two years, right?
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:11.540]   And you can actually see the effect of being more moderate will gain you an extra two or three or four points, right?
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:16.540]   Being less moderate, more radical in some cases, will lose you two or three or four points.
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:21.540]   And so the fact that the GOP didn't kind of take that lesson and say,
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:30.540]   we can actually kind of occupy the mainstream and have potentially really large majorities, at least in 2022.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:34.540]   I mean, I think that's kind of disheartening in some ways.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.540]   And of course, Trump is still a big figure in the GOP.
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.540]   Have Democrats learned the lesson of that race either?
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.540]   No, of course they haven't.
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.540]   Yeah, I don't think anyone's really learned very many lessons.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:46.540]   Nobody's learned any lesson at this point. It's still chaos, right?
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:53.540]   The lesson for Democrats would be to tack towards the center as well, instead of embracing sort of the progressive left.
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.540]   I mean, the Democrats are still talking about canceling student debt,
[00:36:56.540 --> 00:37:01.540]   which is a fringe issue that affects 8 to 10 percent of the Democratic Party,
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:08.540]   without realizing that it actually is because it represents 50 or 60 percent of the working majority of the Democratic infrastructure.
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.540]   And that's a really big difference.
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:17.540]   People are self-serving, and if you don't have good BS detectors, then you become more self-serving.
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:28.540]   Clearly, the class of people who are high student loan debt are people who are well-educated and aren't necessarily making as much money.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.540]   And those describe people that tend to be Democrats.
[00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:34.540]   It describes people like academics and people in media.
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:41.540]   I understand, but Democrats used to also be the workers' party for the welders, the truckers, the construction workers.
[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:50.540]   You should say, "Let's forgive up to $10,000 in debt for public university students' undergraduate educations."
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:56.540]   That really does capture a lot more people who are truly middle class.
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:01.540]   Half of student loan debt is people going to graduate school.
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:06.540]   I'm not that sympathetic if you went to Dartmouth and got a philosophy degree.
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:07.540]   Masters.
[00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:08.540]   Masters, right?
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:09.540]   Yeah, you're on your own.
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:13.540]   If you went to a state school and got a degree in nursing and are kind of—
[00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:17.540]   Yeah, why shouldn't an electrician bail out the person getting a master's in philosophy at Dartmouth?
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:20.540]   But this is kind of a matter of like the—
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.540]   I mean, that's a reasonable thing to say.
[00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:24.540]   Yeah, it doesn't seem partisan.
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.540]   It doesn't seem unreasonable.
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:27.540]   Super reasonable, yeah.
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.540]   But, you know, I don't know.
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:33.540]   And again, people are—it's also different, I think, if you needed more financial stimulus,
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.540]   then it might make more sense to find some way to do that.
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.540]   It's a thing that the president can probably do by executive authority.
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.540]   It's a little bit disputed.
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:47.540]   But no, you kind of have—I mean, both parties are quite self-serving.
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.540]   And if you're kind of not listening to critiques or feedback,
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:56.540]   then you kind of wallow in that self-servingness, I think, a little bit more easily.
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:59.540]   All right, everybody, please thank Nate Silver.
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:01.540]   Thank you.
