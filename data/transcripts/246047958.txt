[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.400]   Let's pray.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.400]   Gracious Father, we thank you again for the privilege that we have to be able to come
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.460]   and worship you.
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.080]   We pray, Father, that you would give us eyes to see, ears to hear, and hearts that are
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.840]   easily molded, Lord God.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.760]   We pray that your word would have the authority and power over our lives as it ought to.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.040]   Help us to understand and to apply your word this morning.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.720]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.840]   As we've been studying Romans chapter 12, we started in verse 1 where Paul says, "In
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.100]   view of God's mercy."
[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.940]   In light of his mercy and by the authority and the power given through us by his mercy
[00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.960]   to present our body as a living sacrifice, which is our spiritual act of worship.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.920]   So our reasonable response to God in view of our salvation is to worship him.
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.080]   And then it says in verse 2, "The application of that is not to conform to this world but
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.840]   be transformed by the renewal of our mind so that we may test and may discern what is
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.000]   the will of God, what is good, acceptable, and perfect."
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.460]   So verse 3 and verse 8 basically is an application that specifically we are told to transform
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.440]   our mind, not to be conformed but to transform by renewing of our mind.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.000]   So starting from verse 3, he'll go into details of what that looks like.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.920]   The first application of that.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.600]   So this morning we're going to look at three separate principles that we see about sanctification
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.440]   in application within the context of the body of Christ.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.280]   But before we even get into it, I want to give you the whole summary of what we're going
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.280]   to be talking about.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.260]   So I'm going to tell it to you now and then I'm going to repeat it later.
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.800]   So if you happen to fall asleep in the middle, at least get the beginning and get the end.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.800]   So that's the...
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.560]   I'm just going to tell you ahead of time.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.600]   Sanctification, Paul has been stating starting from chapter 1 through chapter 11, it happens
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.280]   when we confront the glory of God and we are humbled and it leads us to repentance.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.480]   Repentance is the key to our salvation.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.400]   Christ offered himself as a living sacrifice for us and he took on our sins upon himself.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.000]   So when we are confronted by the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, we can either
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.800]   say, "I don't believe in that," and walk away from that.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.160]   Or when you're confronted by that, it causes you to recognize your own sins and repent.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.480]   And as you know, the word repentance, metanoia, literally means to change your mind.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.880]   So repentance in justification isn't just, "I did something Tuesday or Thursday or I
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.040]   have this act or a particular aspect of my life I'm repenting."
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.320]   Justification happens when you recognize that there is a sin nature in you.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.080]   That the way you view the world, the way that you view what is right, what is wrong, creation,
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.760]   purpose, death, life, all of it was tainted by this world.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.960]   So when you're confronted by the gospel of Jesus Christ, you repent.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.720]   Your mind is changed.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.160]   But for some reason, when we come to sanctification, we think, "Well, we've done that.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.320]   We've humbled ourselves and we've repented."
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.000]   And the rest of it is hard work trying to get closer to God through our works.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.640]   Now there's an aspect of it where it is true, where it does require our labor, it does require
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.200]   our commitment.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.360]   But again, this is the summary of what we're going to be talking about this morning.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.480]   Justification happens when we humble ourselves before God.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.760]   Sanctification begins when we humble ourselves before man.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.400]   Let me say that again.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.000]   Justification happens when we humble ourselves before God.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.760]   Sanctification begins when we humble ourselves before man.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.000]   So it begins with humbling ourselves, and then we continue by humbling ourselves.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.120]   And that's exactly what Paul is saying in verse 3 to verse 8.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.100]   So typically, we can get into this and look at the different gifts and how they all fit
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.520]   in together, and we are going to talk some about that, but I want to give you a bigger
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.640]   picture and understand it in the context of how the Jews probably would have heard what
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.400]   he was saying.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.820]   So the first thing that we want to look at is sanctification requires thinking soberly
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.080]   of ourselves, first and foremost.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.720]   Sanctification requires thinking soberly of ourselves.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.960]   He says in verse 3, "For by the grace given to me, I say to everyone among you not to
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.640]   think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment,
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.640]   each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned."
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:44.800]   Paul says in 1 Timothy 1, 15-16, that though he was being used to plant churches, many
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.000]   people are coming to Christ.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.700]   He says to Timothy, his protege, training the young pastor, he says, "This saying is
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.520]   trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.720]   sinners of whom I am the foremost."
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:07.540]   Paul, even though by this time he was more than a decade into his conversion, he planted
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.120]   maybe dozens and dozens of churches, revelation was coming through this man, and obviously
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.380]   he was bearing much fruit in God's kingdom, yet he never forgot.
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.200]   He never forgot who he was.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.200]   So he says, "I am the worst of sinners."
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.720]   He doesn't say, "God didn't save me because I had so much potential and because I was
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.520]   a Pharisee among Pharisees and because he was already probably somewhat famous, and
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.920]   so God thought, 'Man, this man could be useful for me.'"
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.800]   Instead, Paul recognized the very reason why he was saved and made an apostle was exactly
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.800]   the opposite.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.600]   It was because he was the worst of sinners.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.640]   The whole purpose, for the purpose of putting him on a pedestal, not to highlight him, but
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.600]   to highlight God's mercy.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.240]   That if God could forgive him, if God could save him, the worst of sinners, and he really
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.280]   was the worst of sinners.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.560]   Remember, he was responsible for the first martyr in the church.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:12.360]   He was willing to go and drag Christians into court and even kill them.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.880]   So when he confronts Christ on the road to Damascus, Jesus himself says, "Why are you
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.040]   persecuting me?"
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.760]   He doesn't say, "Why are you persecuting my people?"
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.240]   He says, "Why are you persecuting me?"
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.680]   So apostle Paul was responsible for all that.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.240]   He had so much hatred for Christ and his people.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.560]   So when Paul says he's the worst of sinners, he recognizes that God had every right to
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.840]   crush him.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.440]   On that road to Damascus, Jesus could have easily said, and humanly speaking, well-deserved,
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.380]   "Who are you to persecute me and to kill my people?"
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.400]   And then instead of blinding him and converting him and using him, God could have easily crushed
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.160]   him.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.920]   Paul never forgot about that.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:04.520]   And that's why he says, "Timothy," this is a trustworthy saying, "that he saved me because
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.920]   I was the worst of sinners."
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.880]   Why is he telling this to Timothy?
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.880]   Because Timothy is being trained for ministry.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.600]   And he's telling Timothy to have a sober judgment about himself.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:20.880]   Now we may look at that and falsely apply, well, God is saying that we should recognize
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.120]   ourselves as the worst of sinners and every once in a while I'll hear somebody say, "My
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.920]   name is so-and-so, the worst of sinners."
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.980]   And I know they mean one, I don't mean to judge their intent, but it just doesn't come
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.880]   off right because it almost sounds like there's a competition as to who recognizes who's the
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.880]   worst.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.880]   It's like, "No, I'm the worst of sinners."
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.880]   No, I am the worst of sinners.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.880]   Are you kidding me?
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.280]   I am the worst of sinners.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.080]   I am the worst of sinners.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.400]   I am the worst sinner in the universe.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.120]   There's nobody who's worse than me.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:00.240]   It just doesn't sound right because I don't think we really truly believe that.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.200]   We say that because we think that that's what Paul means when he says, "Don't think of yourself
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.200]   so highly."
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:12.360]   So we kind of deliberately try to lower ourselves and by lowering ourselves we're kind of indirectly
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.360]   raising ourselves.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.360]   It just doesn't sound right.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.480]   It's just false humility.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.040]   That's not honest.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.420]   And I don't think that's what Paul is saying here either.
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:27.620]   He's saying don't look at yourself higher than you ought, but to think of yourself soberly
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.620]   with right judgments.
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.900]   In other words, he's not saying, "Don't say, 'Oh, I'm the worst.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.900]   I'm no good.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:33.900]   I can't do anything.'"
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.460]   It's, "Oh, could you help out at church?"
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.460]   "No, I'm illiterate.
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.460]   I can't do anything."
[00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.020]   You know what I mean?
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.180]   "I don't know how to read.
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.180]   I don't know how to think.
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.180]   I have no gifts.
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.180]   I have nothing."
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.460]   It's like, "Oh, I'm so godly."
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.340]   That's not what Paul is saying here.
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.420]   Paul is not saying here not to think of yourself highly and say, "You're worthless.
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.420]   You're no good.
[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.420]   You're wicked.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.420]   You're a worm."
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.180]   And sometimes we express ourselves that way.
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.140]   You don't really mean it, but you think that that's what it means to be godly.
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.460]   That's not what he's saying at all.
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:09.180]   He says don't think of yourselves higher than you ought, but to think of yourselves soberly
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.180]   with correct judgment.
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.500]   What does he mean by that?
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:20.620]   To think how God sees us, the way God views us.
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:26.660]   I think the perfect example of that, when Paul introduces himself in most of his letters,
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:35.580]   he says, "I'm Apostle Paul," and then he says, "The bondservant of Jesus Christ."
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.140]   And the word literally means slave of Jesus Christ.
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:44.460]   So when you think of the word slave, automatically it's a title of humiliation.
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.740]   During that period of time, I mean, to be a slave, obviously you had no right.
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.280]   You couldn't own property.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.620]   If your master decided to kill you, they could.
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.500]   I mean, you had no rights, no legal rights.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:01.180]   So when Paul says, "I am a slave of Jesus Christ," the title in and of itself is a title
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.540]   of humility.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:08.960]   But he says, "I'm a bondservant of Jesus Christ."
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.780]   That's just like saying, "I'm a cook."
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:11.780]   Oh, you're a cook?
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:12.780]   It's okay.
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.780]   "For the president."
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.540]   "I'm the secretary."
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.540]   Oh, you're a secretary.
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.900]   "Of the United States."
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.940]   So those two terms come together.
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:30.620]   It is a title of humility, but because it's connected to the United States, it's a title
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.760]   of honor.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:38.060]   So when Paul says, "I am a slave of Jesus Christ," it is both a statement of humility
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.100]   and it is also a statement of honor.
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:47.300]   That's what Paul means when he says in Philippians 4.13, "I can do all things through Christ
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.500]   who strengthens me."
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.260]   It would be wrong if Paul said, "I can do all things."
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.860]   Do you know what kind of training that I've had?
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.860]   You know what kind of success I've had?
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.020]   You know what kind of education?
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.500]   I know the law better than anybody else.
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.660]   That's not what Paul is saying.
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.180]   Neither is he saying, "Oh, don't ask me.
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.180]   I'm so low.
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.660]   I'm the worst of sinners.
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.380]   I can't do anything.
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.380]   I can't lead people.
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.380]   I can't share the gospel.
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.380]   I know nothing.
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.980]   I have nothing to offer the church.
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:14.980]   I'm so humble."
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.060]   That's not what Paul is saying either.
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:24.860]   He says, "I can do all things through him who gives me strength."
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:32.060]   So Paul sees himself and the power that he's been given, not in and of himself, because
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.740]   he was connected to God.
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:39.020]   Romans 8, 37, "Knowing all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.540]   loved us."
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:47.380]   For whatever the reason, we think that whenever we learn about Christ and his glory and what
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:51.420]   he expects of the church, our natural response is, "We're such failures.
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.660]   We're no good.
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.380]   We're just no good.
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.460]   We're the worst of sinners.
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:57.460]   We can't.
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.700]   You're so good, and we're no good.
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.780]   We're just wretched sinners.
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.280]   We're no good, no good, no good."
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:07.420]   And then we create this environment where we think true maturity is a bunch of weak
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:13.900]   people who never succeed, always sins, but God always forgives the end.
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.980]   Is that what he is saying when he says, "Do not think of yourself higher than you ought"?
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:24.780]   But he's saying, "No, think of yourself soberly from God's perspective, from what he sees."
[00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:30.280]   See, 2 Corinthians 10, 12, it says, "But when they measure themselves by one another and
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.980]   compare themselves with one another, they are without understanding."
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:41.780]   The problem with our self-esteem or our arrogance is always comes because we compare ourselves
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.740]   with each other.
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.500]   And it doesn't take a whole lot for us to become proud.
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.740]   It doesn't take us a lot.
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.600]   You walk into a room, and you're a little bit taller than everybody else.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.420]   You don't say it, but you feel it.
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.740]   You feel dominance.
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:05.380]   You go to the gym, every other guy is lifting 160 pounds, and you got two plates on.
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.920]   That's right.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.460]   You don't say it, but you feel it.
[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:18.420]   Recently, I just read that UC Irvine has bypassed UCSD in ranking.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:22.780]   I don't hear anything.
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.380]   You didn't say it, but you felt it.
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.740]   I know.
[00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:33.700]   And then there's UCLA graduates in here, it's like...
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.860]   And then the Berkeley people won't even enter the conversation.
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.860]   They don't need to.
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.180]   You already know.
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.180]   And Stanford, don't come to our church.
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.080]   They're too good for us.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.580]   It doesn't take a lot for us to become arrogant.
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.580]   It really doesn't.
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.140]   You don't have to be so much greater than the next person.
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:14:00.220]   But when we compare ourselves with ourselves, you have either two things.
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:04.460]   Either one, you think you're better than everybody, and then you become proud.
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.660]   You read a little bit more, you're a little bit more fit, you're a little bit taller,
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.900]   you're a little bit better looking, your hair's straighter than somebody...
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.660]   It doesn't take a lot.
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:17.340]   Or the other end is low self-esteem.
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:22.380]   I'm unworthy, I can't, I don't make as much money as these people, I haven't been as successful,
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.600]   I can't do this, I can't do that.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.020]   That is just as wrong.
[00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:31.340]   Because we're seeing it from the eyes of the world, what we have learned from the world,
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:35.360]   to value ourself based upon comparing with other people.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:45.740]   So pride and self-focus can manifest in pride and also false humility.
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.180]   That's not what Paul is saying.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:53.140]   Paul is saying not to think of yourself highly than you ought to think.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:15:01.340]   In other words, besides what God says of you, but to think of yourself soberly.
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:06.060]   And that's why you look at James chapter 4, 6, God said, "God opposes the proud, but gives
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.140]   grace to the humble."
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:14.460]   I mean, the perfect example of that is Nicodemus and the Samaritan woman.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:19.820]   Nicodemus comes to Christ, you know, and he's afraid about his reputation.
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.740]   He's sitting up on the mountain because he's climbed this mountain and he's an expert of
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:30.020]   the law and everybody's looking up to him because he's the moral example of Israel.
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.060]   He comes and he's concerned about his reputation.
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.940]   If I come and talk to him, what are my friends are going to say about me?
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.960]   So he comes proud, even though he might be the Messiah.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.860]   You could see the pride in him and Jesus yanks him down from his mountain.
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.900]   And he says, "You have to be born again."
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.780]   It's like, how can the man be born again?
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.860]   You're right, you can't do it.
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.860]   It has to be of the spirit.
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.260]   Well, how do I do that?
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.980]   It's not up to you.
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.340]   The spirit comes and goes where it goes and no one knows.
[00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.020]   In other words, it's completely up to him.
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.340]   It's completely up to him, he has nothing to do with you.
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.000]   And he basically yanks him off that mountain.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.300]   And then here's this woman in Samaritan chapter 4, she's concerned about his reputation.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.620]   Aren't you afraid what they're going to say?
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.980]   You're talking to a sinner, a Samaritan woman?
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.220]   She said, "Go bring your husband."
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.220]   And then she recognizes, "I'm a sinner, I don't have a husband."
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:28.940]   And he engages her and he actually reveals himself to her and tells her, "I am that Messiah."
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.580]   And that's exactly what it means.
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:37.260]   In James chapter 4, 6, he opposes the proud, he humbles the proud, but he gives grace to
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.260]   the humble.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.340]   There's a reason why Ephesians 2, 8, it says, "For by grace you have been saved through
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:48.380]   faith and not of yourselves, so that no one may," what?
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.220]   "Boast."
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:54.940]   So the whole point of justification was to humble us.
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:17:00.980]   To humble us so that we could see ourselves from God's perspective.
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:05.460]   So again, he's not calling us to be like, "Oh, I'm nothing, I can't be useful."
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.880]   Paul says, "I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.400]   It's because of him, it's because of our connection to him.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:19.160]   So when we compare ourselves with ourselves, either you become arrogant or you start having
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.800]   low esteem and say, "Oh, woe is me."
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:25.860]   And then either way, you become useless in the kingdom of God.
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.920]   But when we see ourselves in the eyes of God.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:35.200]   See, if you were a slave, if you were a slave without this connection to God, that would
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.220]   be the worst thing to call yourself.
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.920]   You had absolutely no right.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:48.920]   But because you are a slave of Jesus Christ, every single one of us, no matter how successful
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:55.680]   you were, when you came into church, we all had level ground.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.640]   Every single one of us comes to God as wretched sinners in need of his mercy.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.020]   But that's not where we end.
[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.020]   That's where we were.
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.920]   We were the worst of sinners.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.760]   We have sin nature.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:11.480]   It doesn't matter how successful you were, how much you've read, and no matter what it
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.920]   is that you've done, at the core of who we are, all have sinned and fall short of the
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.640]   glory of God.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.160]   But as a result of that, as a result of it, God forgave us and made us what?
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:28.340]   Our source of pride is not your achievement, is not how you look, what school you came
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.720]   out of, and what the world says about you.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.240]   Our source of pride and confidence is what?
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.120]   Is Christ.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.480]   That I am able to call him my Abba Father.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.720]   I am co-heirs with Christ.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.000]   That's where my boasting is.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.920]   That's why Paul says, "I boast in my weakness, because in my weakness, he is strong."
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:51.440]   So our title, in and of itself, is humiliation.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:57.260]   But when we're connected to Christ, it's a source of great strength.
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.260]   So that's what Paul means.
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.120]   First, we need to have a proper view of ourselves.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:07.000]   Our thinking needs to change, that we don't apply what the world says into our Christian
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   lives.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.600]   Secondly, sanctification requires humbling of ourselves, recognizing our unity.
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:15.600]   Our unity.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.120]   First four and five.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:22.160]   For as in one body, we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function,
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:28.040]   so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:34.800]   Now as a Gentile, which all of us are, when we read this passage, certain things are naturally
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.280]   are more emphasized.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.280]   We think about the diversity.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.840]   We think about the diversity, we think about the oneness, and we're the body of Christ,
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.560]   and how we ought to support one another, and all of that.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:50.920]   And all of that is true, but I want you to think like a Jew.
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:56.100]   Jew in the first century, if he heard this, how he would have understood this?
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:59.320]   What would have been his first emotional response to this?
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.140]   To say that we're all one.
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:05.340]   Think about who is in the church.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:06.540]   Think about who is in the church.
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:11.480]   So if you were a Jew, and you heard this, how you would have responded?
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:16.680]   Again, Paul says in Ephesians 4, 4-7, "There is one body and one spirit, just as you were
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:26.000]   called to one hope that belongs to your call, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.120]   and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:35.400]   But grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ's gift."
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.440]   We as Gentiles read that and say, "That's awesome.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.200]   One God, one faith, we're all one together."
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:49.140]   The reason why Gentiles hear this and we say, "Great, because we weren't in the kingdom.
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.140]   We were the outsiders.
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.140]   We were the peasants.
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.040]   We didn't have the Old Testament.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.660]   We didn't have the sacrifices.
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.960]   We weren't privileged."
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:02.840]   So when a Gentile hears this, "Great, we were the ones who are far off and he brought us."
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.500]   But imagine if you were a Jew.
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.040]   You were the owners of the kingdom.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.000]   You had the law of God.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.520]   You've been practicing the commandments for hundreds of years.
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.160]   You have the promises.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.600]   You have the patriarchs.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:26.420]   And then you're entering in, and again, it didn't take a whole lot to fill the Israelites
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.620]   with pride.
[00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.500]   They were proud that they were children of Abraham.
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.420]   Remember that conversation that Jesus has with the Jews in John chapter 8?
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:40.380]   He says, "If you abide by my truth, you will be my disciples and you shall know the truth.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:41.380]   Truth shall set you free."
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.420]   And then they react like, "We're children of Abraham.
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.300]   Why would you even say that we need to be set free?"
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.480]   They got offended.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:53.220]   Because it was a source of pride that they were Jews, descendants of Abraham.
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.300]   But that didn't end there.
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.640]   Even within the Jews, compared to the rest of the world, it was a source of pride.
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.840]   But even within the Jews, they had a hierarchy of which tribe that they belonged to.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.860]   So the most prestigious tribe, obviously, were the tribe of Judah.
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:09.800]   And then the second most prestigious was the tribe of Benjamin.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:14.660]   And then you had the other 10 who fell out and joined the rebellious kingdom, the northern
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:15.660]   kingdom.
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:19.700]   But if you happen to be, whatever tribe you are, whatever history, good or bad, you had,
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:20.700]   there was a source of pride.
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:25.540]   So they say, "Well, we're a tribe of Benjamin, a tribe of Judah."
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.940]   And then even within that system, you had the Pharisees, you had the Sadducees, you
[00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:35.420]   had the Zealots, you had the different sects in the group where there was a source of pride.
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:40.620]   So the most prestigious within the different groups was the Pharisees because they were
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.620]   obedient to the law.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:47.320]   They were considered the moral examples of Israel.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:52.400]   So if you happen to be a member of the Sanhedrin among the Pharisees, I mean, you were the
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.640]   cream of the crop.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:01.340]   That's why Paul says in Philippians 3, 4, "For we are circumcision, who worship by the
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:06.420]   Spirit of God in glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh."
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.340]   And the reason why he says that is because he's talking to people who are putting confidence
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.340]   in their flesh.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.380]   These Judaizers are saying, "You don't know.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.980]   I mean, we know the law.
[00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:14.980]   We have all of this.
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:15.980]   We know the theology.
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:20.700]   You know, these Gentiles are coming in and we're going to be equal?
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:24.520]   How can we possibly be equal with somebody who's been studying and trying to obey the
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:31.020]   law for hundreds of years with these Gentiles who were just a few days ago, were at the
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.660]   Temple of Artemis?
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:39.740]   They were worshiping idols, sacrificing pagan worship, and now they're in the same church
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.420]   and we're the same?"
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:47.500]   See, if you were a Jew and you heard what Paul was saying, you wouldn't have, your initial
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.220]   response would have been like benevolence, like, "Oh, great.
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.220]   We're all together.
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:53.540]   You know, we're Gentiles.
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:59.360]   So it's good for us, for a Jew who invested all their time and energy and money to elevate
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.220]   themselves to say, 'No, you guys are all the same.'"
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.900]   It probably didn't hit them the same way.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:11.940]   Paul says to them, "If you want to go head to toe with me, if anyone else thinks he has
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.700]   reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.820]   Circumcised on the eighth day of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:23.780]   of Hebrew, as to the law, a Pharisee, as to zeal, a persecutor of the church, as to righteousness
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.900]   under the law, blameless."
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:33.340]   But he said all of that that he had achieved, and every single thing that he says here wasn't
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:38.980]   in the context of chasing money, it wasn't in the context of idol worship, it was in
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:43.020]   the context of worshiping God and obeying and studying the scriptures and applying the
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:46.420]   scriptures, even though he got it all wrong.
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:52.420]   All of that, in light of the surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ, it was rubbish.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:57.180]   So when he says, "First recognize that we are all one in the body of Christ," it is
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:07.500]   a call to humility, that the gospel, it humbles the haughty and it raises the humble.
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.940]   That's what he means that we're one.
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:13.180]   That's why in Galatians 3, 28, it says, "There is neither Jew nor Greek."
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:17.420]   That's great for the Greeks, because the Greeks never sacrificed.
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.740]   Greeks were outside, they were far.
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.620]   But he says to the Jews, "No, we're the same.
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:26.140]   There is neither slave nor free."
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.420]   Imagine if you're in the church and you used to be a slave owner, and then one of your
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:37.140]   slaves is sitting in the church, and then Paul says, "You're the same."
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.020]   How can we be the same?
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.100]   I own this guy.
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.900]   I could do whatever I wanted.
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.700]   I paid for him.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.820]   And then now we're in the church and he's my brother?
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:52.840]   There's a whole letter written to address this issue, Philemon.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.580]   But that's what the early church was like.
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:58.660]   You had these guys who studied the scripture, Old Testament, and applied it, and all of
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:04.180]   a sudden a tax collector is there teaching them about the kingdom of God.
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.980]   And he says, "You guys are the same."
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.620]   If you were a slave, slave, that's great news.
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:13.700]   If you're a slave owner, like what?
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.980]   Everything that I've achieved out there, all the honor and prestige that I had up there,
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.180]   all of that means nothing here?
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:23.740]   Yes, that's exactly what he is saying.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.180]   That is exactly what he's saying.
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.580]   You know, it's strange that you and I live in a culture where if somebody has great honor
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:35.060]   over there, they're multimillionaires or sports figures or movie stars, and all of a sudden
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:39.120]   they convert and they become a follower of Jesus Christ, and then they become leaders
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.580]   in the church.
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:45.700]   Because we're applying whatever honor and achievement that they had here, and then we're
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.460]   applying it in the church.
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.740]   And again, there's a whole letter written about that too in the book of James.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:55.900]   They're honoring the people who are rich and putting them in the front seats and how
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.100]   that dishonors God.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.660]   That's exactly what Paul was saying here.
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:06.860]   He says, "Slave or free, there is no male or female."
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.300]   Christianity gets a bad rap.
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.740]   It's like, "Oh, you know, male chauvinist pigs.
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.020]   Apostle Paul saying that, you know, wives submit to your husband."
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:20.060]   And I remember one of the earliest weddings that I officiated, again, they're not here,
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.460]   so I can say it.
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.140]   I remember, and I didn't know the wife that well, you know, it was just somebody that
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.220]   I knew and I decided to, okay, I'll officiate.
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:31.540]   And I didn't get to meet them until about three days before the wedding, and we were
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.780]   going over the vows.
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:38.780]   And she said she refused to say submit.
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.460]   She said, "It's not romantic.
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.340]   I don't want to create this environment in the wedding."
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.340]   And she said, "I refuse."
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.980]   So that's interesting.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:52.380]   You know, I was a young pastor at that time and I don't have a lot of experience.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.700]   I was kind of wrestling with what I do.
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.180]   I don't want to ruin their wedding, but at the same time, it's going to go against my
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.480]   conscience.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.740]   And so I prayed about it, and the next day I contacted the guy that I knew and I said,
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.220]   "I can't officiate your wedding."
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:10.020]   He said, "I'm going to help you find somebody, you know, but I can't officiate your wedding."
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:15.820]   You know, because what I'm asking you to do is to quote scripture.
[00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:19.220]   And if you can't quote scripture, it bothers my conscience.
[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:22.900]   I can't come before God and say, "God, the Lord blesses this wedding when I know in my
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.860]   heart you're refusing his lordship in your life."
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:31.380]   We get a bad rap because you say, "Well, you know, Christianity, it puts women in one place
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.060]   or whatever."
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:39.700]   But it's Christianity that gave equality among men and women.
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:44.140]   The reason why the world has this knee-jerk reaction against leadership and submission
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:48.340]   is because of this worldly principle of if you have more money, if you're in a higher
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:53.120]   position of power, you're more valuable.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.000]   But the kingdom of God is completely different.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.300]   You have God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.280]   They're all one of the same equality.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:06.820]   And yet, each one of them functions to serve one another, glorify each other.
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:12.420]   So when we put men in leadership and women to submit, automatically wrong.
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:19.220]   But is that sense of wrong coming from the kingdom or is it coming from the other kingdom?
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:23.380]   We would never tolerate if a rich person comes in and giving them honor.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.900]   We would actively say, "That's not right."
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:32.020]   If somebody is better looking, somebody has more money, we know innately that's wrong.
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:36.820]   But why do we apply that principle when it comes to the order of creation?
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:41.200]   And I want you to think about it this way.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.460]   Which is harder to do?
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:51.100]   To call somebody, to love somebody sacrificially to the point that even if they curse you out,
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:58.100]   even if they're slandering you, to not only tolerate it but give them your best.
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:04.220]   Or support somebody that despite no matter what you do, despite everything that you've
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:09.620]   done, that they're going to forgive you and cover over that and just honor that person.
[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:12.160]   Because that's exactly what it says in Ephesians 5.22.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.880]   We look at the word submit and say, "Oh, how dare you?
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.880]   This is archaic.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.200]   What kind of a church is this?"
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.780]   And yet if you read it carefully, it's saying for the husband to be like Christ who gave
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.740]   up everything.
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.440]   For who?
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.740]   For sinners.
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.480]   For blasphemers.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:35.300]   He demonstrated his own love toward us and that while we were yet sinners, he loved us.
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:42.600]   So if there's any knee-jerk reaction, kingdom-minded person is like, "What?
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.460]   Love my wife unconditionally?
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.660]   How dare you?
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.940]   What kind of a church is this?
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:54.000]   Why would you ever call perfectly righteous people who've done nothing wrong to sacrifice
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.600]   everything for a sinner?
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.860]   Why would you do that?
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:57.960]   What kind of a church is this?
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.960]   That's archaic.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:30:59.960]   Who would apply this?"
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.100]   But we don't respond to it that way.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.540]   It's the fallen world.
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:09.340]   It's fallen paradigm that we apply to the church.
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:12.500]   That's why we have this knee-jerk reaction because the word submit automatically we have
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.780]   this sinful attitude toward it.
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:19.140]   But if you see the Trinity, the beauty behind how each one takes their role and supports
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:25.060]   one another, and that's what was supposed to be reflected in the home and in the church.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:29.900]   So when he says there is no difference, yeah, it's the same guy who says there is no male
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:35.900]   or female, it's the same guy who tells us the order of the church and order of the home.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.500]   There is no male or female.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.820]   The female wouldn't have a problem with this.
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:44.180]   It's the male that would have had a problem with this.
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:47.180]   For you are all one in Christ Jesus.
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:56.020]   So when he calls us to be one, it's calling to shift our paradigm to think that in the
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:58.940]   kingdom of God, we're all equal.
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:04.220]   We're all sinners who are saved by the grace of God.
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:08.980]   There's no one should be walking into the church thinking that I'm better than other
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:13.420]   people.
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:18.700]   Number three, sanctification requires humbling ourselves by serving one another.
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.940]   Thirdly, sanctification requires humbling ourselves by serving others.
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:27.820]   One, again, just to review, we humble ourselves and see a proper view of ourselves as God
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:28.820]   sees us.
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:34.700]   Secondly, we humble ourselves by recognizing the unity that we are all the same, same body.
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:39.180]   And thirdly, we humble ourselves by actively serving one another.
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:43.700]   So sanctification is not just having right thinking, but right thinking that's leading
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:46.140]   to right application.
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:52.260]   Verse six, "Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:55.780]   if prophecy in proportion to our faith."
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:57.900]   Let me stop right there.
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:01.460]   Whatever gift it is that you have been given, it says first and foremost, you didn't earn
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.620]   it, right?
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:11.100]   So to envy something that you didn't earn or to say, "Well, that's not fair.
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.100]   That's not..."
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.100]   It's basically you're not questioning the church.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.380]   You're not questioning other people.
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:15.780]   You're questioning God.
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:22.620]   He says, "In proportion to the faith given to you by grace, if service in our serving,
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:26.180]   the one who teaches and is teaching, the one who exhorts and exhortation, the one who contributes
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.220]   in generosity, the one who leads with zeal and the one who does the acts of mercy with
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:31.860]   cheerfulness."
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:37.780]   God calls us in our sanctification not to simply, "Well, I've studied the word of God
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:40.420]   and I know this and I know the intricacy of theology."
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.620]   We really want to be sanctified.
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:46.460]   He says, "Serve one another."
[00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:52.220]   You cannot love God and hate the church.
[00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.460]   You can love the church and not love God.
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.420]   That's very easy.
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:02.020]   But you cannot love God and not love the church.
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:06.100]   And let me give you an example of that.
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.180]   You know, I could rip on my kids.
[00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:12.260]   Sometimes I get frustrated, "Oh, they're so selfish.
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.740]   They don't do this and they don't do that."
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:23.020]   But if somebody else joins in, it's like, "Yeah, yeah, our felt selfish."
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.100]   Or maybe you're saying, "Yeah, my mom doesn't do this.
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.100]   My mom doesn't do that."
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:29.980]   Yeah, what is wrong with your mom?
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.740]   It doesn't sit well with you.
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:35.700]   Because even when we're complaining, I mean, we shouldn't be complaining, but even when
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:38.980]   we're complaining, we're complaining in the context because we love them.
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:42.060]   Maybe you don't get along with your siblings or maybe you don't have the best relationship
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:50.460]   with your parents, but deep inside, if something horrible happens to them, you react differently
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.580]   because they're your mom, they're your dad, they're your kids.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:54.740]   There is a base of love.
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:55.740]   And did you earn that?
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:56.740]   Did you work toward that?
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:57.740]   No, because they're yours.
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:58.740]   They're innately.
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.900]   That's what he is saying, that we're all part of this one body.
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.460]   It's just that we don't recognize it.
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:12.340]   You can't love God and say, "I don't want the church."
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:17.900]   God gave us and put us into the church and all he said, "If you want to love God," what
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:18.900]   did he say?
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.100]   "Love your neighbors."
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:24.700]   The most tangible way to express the love for God is to love your neighbors, to serve
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:30.180]   them in uniquely whatever gifts that God has given you, to humble yourselves.
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:34.880]   There aren't certain people, "Oh, you're gifted with serving, but I'm gifted in leadership.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:40.060]   So I delegate and I tell people."
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:44.340]   God called every single one of us to humble ourselves and serve one another because we're
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.340]   equal.
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:50.100]   Maybe in your company, you're the big shot.
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.260]   Maybe wherever you are, you're the manager.
[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.020]   You're the guy who's telling other people.
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.980]   When you come to church, we're all the same.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:57.980]   We're all the same.
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.300]   We are to humble ourselves.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.940]   If we're actively going to give our life as a living sacrifice, which is a reasonable
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:10.620]   act of worship to God, everyone who has been given, which is every single Christian, is
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:16.660]   to use that to serve other people.
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:22.340]   Remember in John chapter 21, when Peter is being restored, he said, "If you love me,"
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.940]   and he says, "Of course I love you."
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:25.620]   Remember what Jesus' response was?
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:26.700]   "Then feed my sheep."
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:31.220]   He didn't say, "If you love me," "Of course I love you," "Then write me a letter."
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.220]   That's not what he says.
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.220]   No, "Then feed my sheep."
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.900]   He says that three separate times.
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:42.100]   The very last thing that Jesus tells his disciples before he goes to the cross, what did he tell
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.300]   his disciples?
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.300]   Humble yourself.
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.220]   Serve one another.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:52.380]   The one who is the greatest in the kingdom of God is the one who serves.
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:59.580]   Unlike the world, or the world knee-jerk reaction is the one who is being served is the greatest.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:03.740]   But in the kingdom of God, the one who serves is the greatest.
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:08.660]   That's the last formal lesson he gave to his disciples.
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:14.100]   It is when we begin to apply the worldly wisdom and worldly paradigm into the kingdom of the
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.700]   church where the church goes into chaos.
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.060]   And that's what he means.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:23.380]   Do not be conformed to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:24.380]   of our mind.
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:31.340]   We need to start thinking like kingdom people, recognizing who we are through his eyes, not
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:34.100]   through your eyes, not through your friend's eyes, not through your partner's, but through
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:36.780]   his eyes.
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.060]   We are more than conquerors.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:41.060]   You know what this means?
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:44.180]   Like every single one of us, there's not a single one of us, including myself and any
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:48.500]   of the leaders who have been given all the gifts.
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:53.420]   In the church, whether you are a small church or a larger church, every single one of you,
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:59.940]   no matter how mature you think you are, there are certain areas of your life are not as
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:03.740]   good as certain people in this church.
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:10.220]   Some of you are really good with discipline.
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.660]   You're really good with discipline.
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.820]   You're always a student.
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:14.140]   You're always high achiever.
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:20.620]   You do what's right to do, but you have no compassion.
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:21.620]   You have no compassion.
[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:23.700]   You're always bitter and angry toward people.
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:29.140]   And then some of you are really good at serving.
[00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:31.340]   You're always in the background serving and cleaning.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:32.340]   You're really good at it.
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:35.580]   You're always the first one.
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:40.260]   But you're so stingy.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.260]   You're not generous.
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:46.780]   You just hold on to your time and your money for dear life.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:50.820]   Some of you are good at praying, but you hate reading.
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:54.580]   Some of you are really good at theology, but you hate serving.
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:39:01.940]   There's not a single one of us who can stand and say, "I'm better than you at everything."
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.740]   There's not a single person here.
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:08.020]   And so what happens is God has distributed the gifts, and then you're doing your work,
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:11.020]   and then you're in the kitchen working, and you want to serve God.
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:15.500]   And then eventually you start grumbling inside, "How come nobody is helping me?"
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.060]   And then you're saying, "How come they're all outside?"
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:20.740]   And the people who are outside serving the snacks, and they're serving.
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:23.840]   And then as they're serving, how come nobody's outside?
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:29.580]   They only want to work inside because it's shaded.
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:33.220]   Here we're under the sun, so nobody's serving here.
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.860]   And then the people who are in the nursery, it's like, "Wow, the kids are acting up.
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:41.300]   All they want to do is serve in the kitchen, but they don't want to help with the kids."
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.660]   And the people who are in the prayer rooms, "We're praying for revival, and all these
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.620]   guys do over here is talk about theology.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:50.100]   And the guys who are in theology, they're reading their scripture, and we're getting
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:54.100]   to deep things of God, but they're never helping out with anything else in the church."
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:58.420]   And you've got people who are out feeding the homeless people, but they don't care about
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.580]   people in the church.
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:04.980]   And so you have various gifts in the church, and everybody's doing their thing, and everybody
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.580]   thinks that everybody ought to be doing what I'm doing.
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:12.060]   Whatever I'm good at is what everybody else should be doing.
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.380]   And so you ruin what you're doing.
[00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:19.620]   So instead of giving it to God as an act of worship and inspiring other people to be better,
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.220]   you start saying, "Why aren't you good at this?"
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.140]   And usually what happens when somebody starts pointing fingers, "How come you're not good
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.020]   at this?"
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:28.380]   Somebody who's praying, "How come you don't do this?
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.380]   How come you don't do that?"
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:33.300]   And again, these are all things that we all ought to disciple each other and be challenged
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.300]   by.
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.340]   We're not saying that somebody who's praying should never study the Bible, or somebody
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.180]   studying the Bible should never pray.
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:43.500]   We're just saying if we approach sanctification by, "What is wrong with you?
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:47.260]   Be more like me," what is the initial response you always get?
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.500]   "Well, look at you.
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.740]   You're going to point that flashlight at me.
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:55.260]   Let me take that and point it at you and see what is wrong with you."
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:57.260]   Now you've got a bunch of people comparing.
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:01.060]   UCI is better than UCSD.
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.580]   Oh, UCSD.
[00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:05.140]   UCLA.
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:06.660]   Berkeley.
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:08.260]   Stanford.
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:10.740]   And then you've got the other people who didn't go to the UC.
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:14.420]   It's like, "Oh, it's me.
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.340]   I can't do anything."
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:20.340]   And then that's the environment that you create in the church.
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.540]   And we're not worshiping God.
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:28.580]   You know, typically when we think of discipleship, we think it's like one person discipling another
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:29.580]   person.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:33.220]   I mean, that is one of the methods that we could use to do that.
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:36.980]   But you know the beauty of the church is we disciple each other.
[00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:43.780]   We disciple each other because some of you are so compassionate.
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.540]   You are willing to drop everything.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:49.740]   If somebody gets sick, you don't think about money.
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.420]   You don't think about time.
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:56.540]   Your life falls apart when somebody gets sick.
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:57.540]   You go running.
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:58.940]   You're by their bedside.
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.300]   You're there in the morning and night.
[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:03.820]   You pick them up and like, "Wow."
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:09.380]   And I watch some of you guys in the way that you just have compassion.
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:10.700]   And that disciples me.
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:11.820]   You don't need to tell me that.
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:13.820]   I've watched your life and that disciples me.
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:16.260]   I need to be better at that.
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:22.540]   Some of you guys are volunteer captains.
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.060]   Any time I say, "Hey, we need—" I'll do it.
[00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:26.460]   "Hey, we need more people."
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:27.460]   I'll do it.
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:28.460]   "We need more people."
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:29.460]   I'll do it.
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:36.380]   So you know like 14 different community groups, 14 different—I mean, you just love to serve.
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.060]   You know, and sometimes we go, "Hey, calm down.
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.180]   Just pick a couple and just be faithful at those stuff."
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:45.900]   I remember when we were going through that one week before we came in here and it was
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:46.900]   kind of like giving birth.
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:51.500]   It was like nine months of labor and then we thought we were going to have a C-section
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.620]   and then it just normally—normal birth happened.
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:57.580]   Remember, some of you guys know what I'm talking about, right?
[00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:01.540]   You guys came out here and some of you guys were here till four in the morning, went to
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:04.260]   work, came back.
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:07.660]   Were here till four in the morning, went to work and came back and swinging hammers.
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:11.460]   And I was praying behind the scene, "Please God, let nobody get hurt."
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:16.460]   But my heart was so full because you guys—I mean, there's some of you guys who are just
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.460]   good at serving.
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:21.180]   I mean, just beyond my comprehension.
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:26.700]   Some of you guys are so good at administration, you know.
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:31.540]   And whenever you're in charge of something, just everything runs better.
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:34.940]   And I'm just so encouraged by that, that you guys are detail-oriented and you just want
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:40.300]   to be excellent at everything that you're doing, you know, because that's not me.
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.100]   I'm more the big picture guy constantly.
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:44.940]   So if the big picture is okay, I don't worry about the details.
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:47.260]   But I need detailed people in my life.
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:48.820]   And so when I watch that, I get discipled.
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:52.900]   I get discipled by the various gift in the church and the way that you guys are serving
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:57.980]   God because it rebukes me, it encourages me, and it challenges me all at the same time.
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:02.640]   And I'm discipled in the body of Christ.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.500]   It doesn't have to be one person meeting up with one person.
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.500]   Now that's a method.
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.580]   I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.
[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:10.460]   I think there's benefits to that.
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.180]   But the beauty of the church is God has given various gifts.
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:17.040]   So if you're only being discipled one person to another person, that one person has all
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.700]   kinds of flaws too.
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:21.540]   That one person doesn't have all the gifts.
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.220]   So you're not going to learn everything from that one person.
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:27.500]   You're going to learn something from that person, but not everything.
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:32.800]   He gave the body of Christ and he distributed the gifts so that we may humble ourselves,
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:37.200]   recognize what we're good at, use it as an act of worship, and when we worship God through
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:41.840]   the gifts that God has given us, we disciple each other.
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:45.720]   So some of you guys who are good at mercy, that challenges the church.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:46.720]   That stirs us up.
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:48.880]   And a lot of times it doesn't require a movement.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.720]   A lot of times it's just one person.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:45:00.440]   One person who is just so faithfully serving God and worried about the homeless and the
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:05.880]   orphans and how that just begins to spread.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.020]   Not because they're complaining, not because of some movement, it's just they watch that
[00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:11.440]   person's life and it's like, "Yeah, I need to do that too."
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:14.240]   Some people are just good at evangelism.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.060]   And you just faithfully evangelize.
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:19.580]   You're just faithfully constantly telling your coworkers to come and sharing the gospel
[00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:21.300]   and asking for prayer.
[00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:25.220]   And because you're worshiping God through those gifts, other people in the congregation
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:28.100]   are like, "Wow, that's something that I need to work on."
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:30.980]   And it challenges me, encourages me.
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:33.300]   Instead of putting you down, it encourages me.
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.520]   So we disciple one another with the various gifts that God has given in the church and
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:42.740]   all in the process of humbling ourselves.
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:45.120]   We humble ourselves in justification.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.820]   We humble ourselves in sanctification.
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:50.300]   So let me conclude what I promised you.
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.760]   What I started in the beginning, let me finish with the end.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:58.240]   So if you remember anything of today's, this morning's passage, remember this.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:01.980]   Justification happens when we humble ourselves before God.
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:06.060]   Sanctification begins when we humble ourselves before man.
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:10.540]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team comes up.
[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:21.020]   Again, I want to encourage you that as you heard the Word of God, apply it specifically.
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:24.620]   What is an area of my life that I'm using either as an excuse because I'm better than
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:28.300]   other people or I'm, you know, like I got nothing to offer.
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:33.300]   And so either way, we're not thinking ourselves soberly.
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:37.380]   Think specifically how should I apply today's Word into my life.
[00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:39.980]   So let's take some time to pray and ask the Lord, "Search me in normalcy.
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:43.380]   If there's any hurtful ways in me, how can I apply this in a practical way?"
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:45.740]   So as our worship team leads us, let's take some time to pray.
