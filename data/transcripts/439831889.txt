[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Hello, good morning.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.820]   My name's Elise Chin.
[00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.460]   I'm married to Isaac Chung.
[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.840]   I've been attending Berean for over seven years
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.700]   and I'm going to share my testimony.
[00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.680]   I'm really nervous, so sorry if I cry.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.160]   By the time that I was a sophomore in high school,
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.500]   I'd moved over 15 times and was living with my mom in Georgia
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.100]   while my dad was serving the US Army as a chaplain
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.660]   stationed in Korea.
[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.880]   My brother was attending UCLA as a freshman
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.860]   and because of the constant moves throughout our lives,
[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.100]   my brother became the closest person to me.
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.020]   He wasn't a good kid though.
[00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.460]   He was always getting into fights.
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.200]   He got suspended, ran off with a car without a license.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.620]   But when he came home for that first summer,
[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.180]   he was a changed man.
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.340]   He would now ask my mom and me to spend time together.
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.780]   He would drive us to get desserts,
[00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.060]   offer to do the dishes and mow the lawn.
[00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.520]   But the most distinguishing memory that I have of that time
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.860]   was that he wouldn't stop talking about Jesus.
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.280]   He'd constantly ask questions
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.000]   that I didn't have answers to.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.640]   And many nights he would come into my room
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.180]   and ask me if I loved Jesus.
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.920]   And that was offensive to me because between the two of us,
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.480]   I'm the one who loved Jesus.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.480]   I'm the good kid after all.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.360]   So one day I finally asked him,
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.040]   "Why do you keep talking about Jesus?
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.440]   "What happened to you?"
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.840]   And that was when he shared the gospel with me.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.320]   I was confused because weren't we already Christian?
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.840]   Doesn't dad being a pastor automatically give us heaven?
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.560]   Sorry, I'm just nervous.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.600]   Nothing's emotional.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.640]   Sorry, where was I?
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.000]   Okay.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.760]   And that's when he shared the gospel with me,
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.900]   but I was confused.
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.400]   And before he went to California for school again,
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.560]   he gave me one last advice,
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.840]   which was to be involved in the church community.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.440]   And so that's what I did.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.180]   Eventually, God led me to the revelation of the fact
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.680]   that if I lived as if God didn't exist,
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.920]   that was just as much an offense as my brother's badness.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.360]   And by God's grace, I recognized my sinfulness
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.400]   and begged God for mercy on my life.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.960]   I understood and believed the good news
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.040]   that Christ achieved perfect obedience for me
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.360]   and paid the price of all my sin and insurrection
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.280]   that I could never accomplish.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.840]   I praise him because I'm completely forgiven and justified,
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.220]   restored back to God.
[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.280]   For Christ also died for sins, once for all,
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.020]   the just for the unjust, so that he might bring us to God.
[00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.640]   First Peter 3.18.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.480]   And before that moment,
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.200]   I lived in fear of disappointing those in authority,
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.880]   much like I saw my brother do.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.200]   And looking back now, that was such a purposeless life,
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.520]   bondage to another man's approval.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.960]   However, I learned that God the creator
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.200]   is the only one worthy of worship from any and all creation.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.080]   Ironically, it disappoints many when I do follow God.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.400]   And so why am I getting baptized
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   over 10 years since that happened?
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.520]   Well, my dad is a Presbyterian minister,
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.180]   and so I was sprinkled as an infant
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.320]   and confirmed after I was saved.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.160]   I never questioned it
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.980]   because I just accepted whatever was taught,
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.680]   and that was all I knew.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.920]   I'll begin by saying that I was saved
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.480]   at a charismatic church.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.960]   And when I left Georgia to attend college in California,
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.720]   I was taught that I don't really need the physical church
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.640]   because I am the church and the spirit lives in me,
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.840]   stuff like that.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.680]   So I didn't attend church
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.960]   and it was a really rough college experience.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.200]   In my first year, I was kicked out.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.000]   I had depressing and suicidal thoughts.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.200]   Sorry, I'm just nervous.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.720]   I performed self-harm.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.360]   I met with a counselor
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.480]   and fell into some of the more obvious sins.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.980]   I can't cry and talk at the same time, sorry.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.600]   Such is the sensuousness and a lack of temperance.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.640]   But I truly believe that God brought me to a place
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.080]   where I would be challenged to know him
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.400]   by really studying the Bible
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.680]   rather than just reading it or relying on sermons.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.240]   And I happened to be here at Berrien.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.680]   And so I moved a lot of times throughout my life,
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.720]   and how I started attending Berrien
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.320]   was a lot of different events
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.200]   that I believe was all purposeful.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.740]   Long story short, I could only attend college in California
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.320]   because while my dad was overseas,
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.200]   that was his declared state.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.040]   I ran into someone at UCI who I knew
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.160]   from when I lived in Temecula for only a year,
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.880]   and that was when I was 12.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.160]   The fact that this person recognized me on Ring Road
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.440]   was really incredible.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.000]   And he invited me to a campus ministry called CCM
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.480]   where I met another person
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.120]   who coincidentally attended high school
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.560]   with my youth leader back in Georgia,
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.360]   who I was very close to.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.160]   This person also introduced me to Sharon Singh,
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.760]   who I had more opportunities to get to know
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.880]   because lo and behold, she was a sister-in-law
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.160]   of one of the two senior girls that I confided in.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.560]   During that difficult year,
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.680]   Sharon went on to disciple me for several years,
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.120]   which led to my consistent attendance at Berrien.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.600]   I did BCC later on,
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.960]   and I started to wrestle on and off
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.020]   specifically with baptism.
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.400]   I always knew where I stood,
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.960]   but I also knew that my parents would not approve.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.280]   But especially once married,
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.920]   Isaac and I knew that we couldn't avoid
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.960]   this conviction any longer.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.680]   I read and studied Jesus' baptism in Matthew 3
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.000]   over and over, studying the Old Testament,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.600]   sorry, and studying Judaism for a little bit.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.320]   And over time, I came to the decision
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.660]   that I wanted to simply obey,
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.760]   just as our Savior did, to fulfill all righteousness.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.600]   Oh my gosh.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.960]   I know this doesn't change
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.480]   his miraculous calling of my life over 10 years ago,
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.520]   but I see this as something important enough to do
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.240]   and something so important that I don't wanna brush off.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.200]   I'm also given the opportunity
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.040]   to be baptized by submersion at a church that I love,
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.440]   so why not take it?
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.520]   I thank God for this time because in a lot of ways,
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.700]   I got to struggle in something
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.960]   that a lot of people don't necessarily have to.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.880]   And it's a privilege that I got to understand
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.640]   a little more deeply the why's, what's, and how's
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.200]   of baptism in this way, and so I'm grateful.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.040]   Thank you.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.040]   (audience applauds)
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:35.620]   (gentle music)
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:42.340]   (water drips)
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.100]   (water splashes)
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.640]   - Just to understand when you go into the water
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.600]   that you're uniting with Christ in his death,
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.760]   and then when you're coming out of the water,
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.760]   you're uniting with his resurrected life.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.680]   - Amen.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.000]   - Then I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.200]   of the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.100]   (water splashes)
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.100]   (audience applauds)
