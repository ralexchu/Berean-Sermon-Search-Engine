[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.680]   If I can ask you guys to turn your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 13 and we'll be reading
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.360]   the first three verses together.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:21.360]   Hebrews chapter 13 verses 1, 2, and 3.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.960]   Hebrews chapter 13 verses 1, 2, and 3.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:32.040]   And I'm going to be reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.760]   Let love of brethren continue.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.120]   Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.120]   knowing it.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.440]   Remember the prisoners as though in prison with them, and those who are ill-treated,
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.600]   since you yourselves also are in the body.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.680]   Let's pray.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:01:01.120]   Heavenly Father, we ask the Holy Spirit to anoint this time.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.400]   May your people, your children, hear the voice of Christ and follow him and him alone.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.800]   Lord, you warned us that in the end times, because the increase in wickedness, that love
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.940]   for you will grow cold.
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.040]   Help us, Lord God, to not to drift, not to neglect this great salvation that you've given,
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.120]   that all that we do may be a reflection of your grace in our lives.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.360]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.480]   I'm just going to give you a heads up ahead of time that I'm going to be in the introduction
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.480]   a little bit longer than normal today, because I feel like this is something that needs to
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.620]   be addressed before we jump into the text.
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.400]   So this is going to be more like a setup.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:54.080]   In the past maybe about six to ten years, I don't know exactly when it became prominent,
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.680]   but the term social justice has spread like wildfire, especially in the last maybe year
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.160]   and a half to two years with all the political and social unrest that churches have become
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.000]   divided, that are you for this or against this?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.840]   How can you ignore the suffering around us?
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.760]   And then you have the other churches who say, "No, we're about the gospel."
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.440]   And so this has become a hot topic in our generation.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.200]   And I want to point out something before we jump into the clear teaching of this text,
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.480]   that we need to understand what the Bible says about this particular subject, because
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.160]   it is such a hot topic.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.680]   Tim Keller in his book called Generous Justice.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.600]   Some of you guys may have read it.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.360]   It has a huge impact.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.020]   It's made a huge impact, especially in the younger generation for the social justice
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.000]   movement in our generation.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.080]   I don't want to talk about what's happening outside the church, because movements come
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.080]   and go.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.840]   What's popular in one generation is not popular in the next generation.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.400]   I'm concerned about what's happening inside the church, how what is happening outside
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.000]   is penetrating inside the church.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.760]   I want to read you a quote from that book, because I've had so many conversations with
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.960]   people about this book and certain things that he said in here that I want to make sure
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.840]   that we're on the same page.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.080]   He says in this book, "If you do not actively and generously share your resources with the
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.000]   poor, you are a robber.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.640]   You are unjust."
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.920]   Now I'm not taking a phrase out of context, because the whole book is about expounding
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.640]   on this thing that he has said.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.720]   That it is not simply a call, but a mandate, and if a Christian does not share his wealth,
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.320]   you are basically in sin.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.840]   You are robbing.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.720]   Now we're Bereans for a reason.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.440]   We're Bereans because our challenge and encouragement is test everything, even test what I'm saying
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.480]   today.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.280]   Test it with scripture, because especially right now, there's so many things that are
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:14.880]   being said in the general atmosphere that has some truth to it, and because it's being
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.440]   said in certain contexts and through certain people that are respected, that we just assume,
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.440]   "Well, he said it.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.480]   It must be true, and there's certain things about that that is true, so it must be true."
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.680]   Now does God call us to live justly?
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.120]   Absolutely.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.040]   If you've been with us studying the book of Titus, it says one of the qualifications
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.120]   of an elder is that he cannot seek sordid gain, meaning unjust gain, that he does not
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.920]   cheat people out and cut corners and does not have integrity in the way he makes money.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.760]   Jeremiah 22, 13, God says, "Woe to him who builds his house without righteousness and
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.900]   his upper rooms without justice, who uses his neighbor's services without pay and does
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.440]   not give him his wages."
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.280]   So clearly, the Bible calls us to justice, but justice he's referring to are people who
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.480]   are taking advantage of the poor, who are causing them to work and not giving them their
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.480]   fair pay.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.800]   Leviticus 19, verse 13 says, "You shall not oppress your neighbor nor rob him.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.000]   The wages of a hired man are not to remain with you all night until morning."
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   These are texts that are quoted in this book as an argument for his point, that if you
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.840]   do not give to the poor, you are robbing, you are in sin.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:41.840]   And so that the term social justice is being thrown around in our generation, which I believe
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.880]   needs to be corrected because it is not justice that the Bible calls us to when it comes to
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.160]   helping the poor, unless you actually robbed somebody, unless they work for you and you
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.780]   didn't give them their fair pay, then you need to practice justice.
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.040]   But what the Bible calls us for is charity.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.360]   Charity.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.260]   Now if you remember, justice is getting what you deserve.
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.480]   You earned it, and so you did.
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.760]   Whether that is penalty of your sin, that's justice.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.480]   Or whether you worked and a certain amount was promised to you, that would be justice.
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.880]   You getting what you deserve.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.720]   You work for it, it belongs to you.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.960]   Mercy is withholding.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.320]   Maybe you deserve to be punished, and God withholds the punishment, and so you are receiving
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.320]   mercy.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:35.640]   Charity, or the word grace, is receiving something that you do not deserve.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.960]   That they are not required to give it to you, but they give it to you.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.840]   And that's the love that you and I have experienced in Christ.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:49.880]   And so the Bible calls us, the way that we discuss this topic, when we use the term justice,
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:56.280]   there's a confusion in the church that if we don't do this, we are in sin.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.200]   Now let me tell you, the first problem that the church experiences in the book of Acts
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:08.800]   is recorded in Acts chapter 5, where if you remember, Ananias and Sapphira is inspired,
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.960]   for whatever the reason, other people, other rich people who are selling their land, they're
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.080]   giving it to the poor, and it's being distributed.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:22.640]   And so they were being very gracious and generous with the wealth that they had, voluntarily.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.080]   Ananias and Sapphira decides that they're going to do the same thing, but the problem
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.980]   with them was, instead of selling and then donating it all to the church to be distributed,
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:39.260]   that they kept some of it, and they lie to the church, pretending that all this was given
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.260]   to them.
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.200]   And as a result of this lie, they are punished.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.760]   So look what it says in Acts 5, 3-4.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:50.000]   But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.360]   keep back some of the price of the land?
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.160]   While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own?
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.420]   And after it was sold, was it not under your control?
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.360]   Why is it that you have conceived this deed in your heart?
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.480]   You have not lied to men but to God."
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.840]   So this punishment wasn't because that they withheld some.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.480]   The punishment was they lied.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.800]   And the way that he describes it was, when before you sold it, the land was yours, meaning
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.180]   it was not required of you.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.160]   When you sold it, nobody commanded you to do it.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.560]   You could have just held on to it, and you wouldn't have been guilty because it was not
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.300]   commanded of you.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:37.800]   So the sin was that he pretended to be generous while lying, holding some back.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:44.120]   The term justice, and then using that term to say that this is the mission of the church,
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.400]   this has to be one of the missions of the church, is a mistake.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:53.440]   It sounds godly, but it is a mistake.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:09:01.880]   If you study history, you'll know that there has been back and forth of the rich people
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.720]   and the poor people, and the poor people rising up and overthrowing the rich, and then after
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.040]   a while the poor people will get rich, and then the poor people will come up and rise
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.140]   against them.
[00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:16.200]   And this social justice movement that we have seen in our generation reminds me a lot of
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:24.520]   what I studied and saw for myself what was happening in China during the Cultural Revolution.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:30.600]   In 1966, after the Communist Party took over, they had this thing called the Cultural Revolution
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:36.400]   under the leadership of Mao Zedong, and it was a movement of the poor.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:42.000]   And so poor farmers got together, and they felt that it was not fair.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.960]   It was unjust to have a certain portion of the population to be filthy rich, and then
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.240]   the farmers have such a struggle in paying their bills because they were having such
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.240]   a hard time.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:01.680]   So this Cultural Revolution basically ignited poor young people, and they wanted basically
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.280]   to overthrow those who are in power.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.520]   During this period, they went after anybody that represented the previous generation,
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.080]   anybody who had wealth, anybody who was religious.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.120]   And so the Communist Party ignited these young people, and during this period between 1966
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:25.820]   and 1976, they said anywhere from several million to up to 40 million people got executed.
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.720]   We don't know the exact number because the Communist Party has never reported that, and
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.840]   we know that it is always underreported because this is not something that they want people
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.920]   to know.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.440]   But the information that leaked out from China, people who were there, they said it was probably
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:46.160]   closer to anywhere from 20 to 40 million people got executed.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:52.880]   When I was there in 1993, I went to visit major sites because part of our trip was a
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.960]   mission trip to kind of have a vision trip toward China, because at that time Christianity,
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.960]   at least the outsiders, were just starting to come in.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.420]   And so I would visit the forbidden cities.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.080]   So those of you who visited Beijing, you know the Forbidden City is one of the main attractions
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.240]   there.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.120]   And half of the Forbidden City was not open because during the Cultural Revolution, it
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.120]   was burned to the ground.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:19.040]   We would go to the Summer Palace, and the majority of the Summer Palace was not open
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.600]   because that was also burned to the ground.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.680]   We would go to the countryside, and any monument that represented the previous generation's
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.440]   power was burned to the ground.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.680]   And so it took years for them to rebuild that.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:37.080]   Since then, they've spent billions of dollars rebuilding the Forbidden City, rebuilding
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.680]   the Summer Palace, and all of this.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:43.320]   But what's ironic about all of this are the people who are rebuilding this are the same
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.360]   people who tore it down.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:51.320]   The young people who went and executed and forced themselves into power because they
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:55.000]   wanted to make it equal, they're the ones who are in power now, and they're using billions
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.480]   of dollars to rebuild the very things that they tore down.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:07.800]   Now I say this because the idea and the practice of justice in the eyes of the world always
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:13.460]   leads to disenfranchisement in the next generation, the next generation.
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:20.880]   Does that mean that God doesn't want us to be charitable, not to care about the poor,
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.880]   that you can just, if you're rich and you have all this money, that you have the freedom
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.680]   to do whatever you want?
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.440]   Clearly the Bible is not teaching that.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:34.320]   I say all of this not because I'm trying to convince you that you can chase money and
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.320]   it doesn't matter.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.160]   Clearly the Bible does not teach that.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:43.960]   But what is happening right now in our generation, in our culture, is not a biblical movement.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.680]   I would say it is unbiblical.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:52.160]   So even the very language that we use to say it is social justice is unbiblical.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.400]   We would say it is social charity that God calls us to.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.400]   Charity.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.360]   Be generous.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.000]   When I was younger, and I shared this with you before, when I first came into ministry,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.560]   Esther and I, we thought we were going to commit to homeless ministry.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:16.360]   In fact, to this day, my Costco card says Acts Homeless Ministry because I got the Costco
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.360]   card because it was a cheaper way to buy hot dogs.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:24.760]   And I would find Farmer John hot dogs, I don't know how much it is now, but it was for $6
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.400]   I can get 50 hot dogs.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.760]   They were not the best quality.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:32.240]   But I bought two packs of those and we were able to feed about 100 homeless every week
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.320]   and then got some hot chocolate and then some people would donate some old stale donuts
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.160]   and that's what we took out in the street every Tuesday.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:46.680]   But during that period, I was very upset with the church.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:52.080]   In fact, I was up in Canada and we were attending this service and there was a homeless man
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.040]   outside begging for money and I saw all these people, hundreds of people just walked by
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:04.000]   and I would be angered because I was so wanting to see this ministry take off and I really
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.920]   felt like that's what God wanted me to do.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:13.240]   And so there was a slogan that I picked up and I would preach this everywhere I go.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:18.600]   And the slogan was, a condemnation to the church, how can you worship a homeless man
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.720]   on Sunday and ignore a homeless man on Monday?
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.440]   I mean that's a great slogan to have, right?
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.640]   If I had, if I could make t-shirts, I would have made hundreds of t-shirts and passed
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.640]   it out.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:38.960]   How can you worship a homeless man on Sunday and ignore that homeless man on Monday?
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:44.640]   And my preaching was as angry as you can get because I felt like, how can you take the
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:50.240]   gospel seriously if you don't care about the poor?
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.720]   How can we possibly go out there and represent Christ if you don't actively give attention
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.720]   to this?
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720]   So that was my passion.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.320]   I was a youth pastor and then a college pastor, but my real passion was to try to help the
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.240]   homeless and try to get as many people involved.
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:09.120]   And that's why I started ACTS ministry and ACTS stands for Alliance of Christians Trained
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.600]   for Service, homeless ministry, right?
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:21.560]   But after years of trying to help people off the streets, I gathered enough money and I
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.800]   remember Gin, Gin sitting back there, we had a, we had a, I forgot what it was, we had
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:32.480]   this fundraiser and we sold tapes, you know, and Gin was, Gin was there when we did that
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.800]   and we had bands that performed and we would sell that and the proceeds that came from
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.000]   that we used that for homeless ministry.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.040]   But after years of doing that, I ran into frustration after frustration after frustration
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:50.440]   because I thought, just like probably many of us here think, they're homeless, so if
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:55.060]   I can get them off the street, feed them, help them get a job, and then disciple them
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:59.800]   in the process, that would be great.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:06.720]   After years of offering and some even, you know, putting them into hotels, paying their
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:12.080]   bills, I would run into moms who had young children living out of their car and then
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:17.160]   we would put them in a hotel, buy the food, pay for the motel, and then try to meet up
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.720]   with them and share the gospel with them.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:25.200]   After years of doing this, and again, some of them even at our house, after years of
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.960]   doing this, I've never seen any progress and the biggest frustration that I ran into
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.960]   is more than that, they didn't want to get off the street.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:43.540]   I said, "I'm offering a place to stay for free, help you get a job, food, discipleship,"
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.080]   and they didn't want to get off the street.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:52.500]   And what I learned from that was homelessness was the symptom, not the problem.
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.480]   Our natural inclination is because we have homes and we're wealthy and they don't
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:03.260]   have it, so if we give it to them and then they get off the street, problem solved.
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.080]   Most of the people that I met out on the street were out on the street because they'd lost
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:10.700]   desire to run this rat race.
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.320]   Something happened.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:18.720]   Drugs, family tragedy, something happened and they no longer want to run this race and
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.040]   they'd rather be out on the street.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:25.800]   And what I realized, that this problem was not simple, that this problem of homelessness
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.900]   was not financial, it was spiritual.
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:36.220]   And so as much as I didn't want to be involved with the church, as much as I was angered
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:43.840]   with the church, my paradigm started shifting because I realized until the church is healthy,
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.840]   all we're doing is plugging up holes in a dam that is going to break.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.120]   And we're not fixing any problem, all we're doing is solving surface problems, but we're
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.360]   not getting to the core issue.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.860]   First Corinthians 1, 21-25 says, "For since in the wisdom of God, the world through its
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.000]   wisdom did not come to know God."
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.720]   And that's the problem.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.620]   The problem with mankind is that we've been separated because of our sins.
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:13.680]   And God, who is the author of life, that mankind has no access to him.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:19.280]   And he says, "Through all of man's wisdom, all the man's effort could not bring him to
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.280]   God."
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:28.840]   And so homelessness, drug addiction, sex trafficking, family issues, all of it is related to this.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.400]   And this problem because we have been separated from the God of the universe, who's the author
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.400]   of life.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:40.040]   He says, "All through mankind, history through their wisdom could not come to know God.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:44.500]   God was well pleased through the foolishness of the message preached to save those who
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.500]   believe.
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:50.760]   For indeed, Jews ask for signs, Greeks search for wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.640]   To Jews, a stumbling block, and Gentiles, foolishness, but to those who are called,
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.480]   both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.720]   Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.560]   men."
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:11.480]   And I realized that until the church is reformed, until the church is healthy, that all the
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:17.540]   work that we're doing, all the mission work, and all the mercy ministry that we do, eventually
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:21.680]   get poured into an unhealthy church.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:27.080]   And we just recycle the problem that came down from us from generation to generation.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:30.440]   That's what caused me to commit to the church.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:37.280]   Because what I wanted to see, not because I've given up on the mercy ministry, but until
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.880]   the church is reformed, until the church is healthy, like I said, I realized all we're
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:47.680]   doing is plugging up a hole in a dam that eventually is going to break.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.160]   Does this mean mercy ministry is not important?
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.600]   Absolutely not.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:58.120]   Everything that I felt at that time was because I was seeing it in Scripture.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.120]   Because I was reading it.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.000]   It wasn't because I had some sort of special affection for homelessness.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.640]   It wasn't because, "Oh, I was homeless, so now I know how they feel."
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.840]   No, I was reading Scripture.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.840]   I was doing quiet time.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.680]   I was doing inductive Bible study, and I would go passage after passage after passage, the
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:18.040]   Bible calling us to care for those who are suffering, just like the text that we're looking
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.800]   at.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:28.120]   I want to show you from this text two things that we need to know in order to practice
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.280]   what the Bible says, social charity, not necessarily social justice.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:37.160]   Number one, we practice charity to reflect who God is.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:45.960]   Remember, we talked about Jesus said to his disciples, "They will know you," by what?
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.960]   By the love that you practice with them, "as I have loved you."
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.200]   It wasn't just any kind of love.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.120]   Remember we talked about that last week, that this commandment to love your neighbor was
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.960]   not a new commandment in the Old Testament.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.520]   It was not a new commandment that all of a sudden, they've never heard this before.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.880]   No, it's repeated all throughout the Old Testament.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.320]   The new commandment was, he said, "As I have loved you."
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.520]   To love people who are not lovable.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.920]   Love people who may not be able to pay you back.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:18.240]   Love people beyond your comfort zone.
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.360]   We love because he first loved us.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.960]   Love of Christ is what ought to compel us.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:30.020]   And so the kind of love that he calls us to is what reflects who he is.
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.960]   You and I were created to be what?
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.880]   To be reflectors of his image, right?
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.560]   Imagio Dei, that's what the theologians call it.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.940]   We are to be image bearers of God.
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.720]   And Jesus says, "That image that I want you to bear is the kind of love that I practice
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.000]   with you."
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.840]   In Luke chapter 14, 12 to 14, he says, "And he also went on to say to the one who had
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.080]   invited him, 'When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.080]   brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:07.520]   Otherwise they may also invite you in in return, and that that will be your repayment.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.400]   But when you give a reception, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:16.320]   you will be blessed, since they do not have the means to repay you, for you will be repaid
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.480]   at the resurrection of the righteous.'"
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:24.560]   The word that he uses here last week was philadelphia, love of brethren.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:29.520]   Here it's philazenia, and the word zenia basically means strangers, people who are
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.000]   outside of our comfort zone.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.120]   So the scripture tells us that we practice charity because it reflects his charity for
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.920]   us.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:46.120]   And it is clear that in the old covenant and the new covenant, it's the same God.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:50.880]   In Deuteronomy chapter 10, verse 19, it says, "So show your love for the alien, for you
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.080]   are aliens in the land of Egypt.
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.760]   Because God was merciful to you, be merciful to the aliens."
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.360]   Leviticus 23, 22.
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:03.300]   "When you reap the harvest of your land, moreover, you shall not reap to the very corners
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.120]   of your field, nor gather the gleaning of your harvest.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.920]   You are to leave them for the needy and the alien.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.480]   I am the Lord your God."
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.960]   I don't know about you, but I remember the first time reading that, and I was thinking,
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.880]   why does he care?
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:26.160]   I mean, imagine in his mind, at some point, he's going to have to sacrifice his son to
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.700]   save the lost.
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:36.460]   But in the process of this redemptive history, he gives attention to nobodies, just aliens,
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.460]   strangers.
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.620]   They're not anybody significant.
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:44.060]   He said, "When you harvest your field, leave a portion of them so that the poor and the
[00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:47.060]   needy and the orphans can have some of that."
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:51.300]   Now you and I don't farm, so it's kind of the imagery doesn't really hit us like it
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.060]   should.
[00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:57.980]   I think what's equivalent to now is if you're getting a paycheck, you give a portion to
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:02.540]   the government, you pay your tithe, and then God says, "Another portion of your paycheck,
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:06.780]   put it in a bag and leave it outside."
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:10.740]   That makes it more real, because we don't farm.
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.060]   So he's like, "Oh, what's the big deal?
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.060]   We'll gather this and this part, we'll give it to them."
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:17.580]   Well, that was their wealth.
[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.120]   That's what they harvested to feed their children.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.500]   That's what they used to gather wealth.
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.820]   So when he says to leave a portion of that, basically he's saying, "Take a portion of
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.900]   your paycheck and leave it outside."
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.100]   For who?
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.100]   Just anybody who's in need.
[00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.820]   This is our God.
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:38.500]   This is not new in the New Testament.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.700]   God had always concern for those who are in need.
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.100]   God says God is near to those who are what?
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:45.420]   Broken hearted.
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:49.140]   In Psalm 146.9, it says, "The Lord protects the strangers.
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:55.120]   He supports the fatherless and the widow, but he thwarts the way of the wicked."
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:59.820]   And the Bible says that he counts the very hair on our head.
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.080]   He's not just saying that.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.820]   You see it throughout redemptive history.
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.180]   All through it.
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:09.940]   And so he calls us that because you and I were strangers at one point, you and I were
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.860]   recipients of this love that you and I didn't deserve.
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:18.000]   He says, he calls us as Christians that we ought to reflect this love.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.300]   Not just the love of your neighbor, not just the love of your children, but strangers.
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:27.620]   That you went out to be hospitable deliberately.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:33.900]   In 1 John 3, 17-18, "But whoever has the world's goods and sees his brother in need and closes
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:39.140]   his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him?"
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:44.020]   How can you proclaim the love of God and how gracious he's been and yet not reflect that
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.840]   in your life?
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.540]   How can you say that you won the lottery and be so stingy with your money?
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.140]   That's basically what he's saying.
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:57.700]   James 1, verse 27, "Pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our God and Father is this,
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:06.500]   to visit orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself unstained by the world."
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:12.860]   That word, philisania, is to invite people into your homes.
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:20.940]   That's literally to love people who cannot help you, love people who can't pay you back.
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:26.980]   You know, one thing that I learned is as I was doing homeless ministry, that you are
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:27.980]   praised.
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.500]   If you do mercy ministry, you're praised.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:35.060]   I've never heard anybody say, "What is wrong with you trying to help the poor?"
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.060]   Never.
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:40.380]   And it was never really that hard to raise money, to collect, "Hey, we're going to go
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.380]   feed the homeless.
[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.660]   We're trying to get them off the street."
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:46.960]   And people are generous, especially if you're doing orphan care.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.960]   People throw money at you.
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:48.960]   "Hey, I want to help.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:53.820]   I've been praying about helping the orphans, so can I give you some money?"
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:27:00.700]   What I realized was as long as I went out on the street to help them, I got praise and
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.700]   I got support.
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:07.340]   But when I started getting pushback was when I started bringing them to the church because
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.540]   it made people feel uncomfortable.
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.060]   Initially, it was, "Oh, it was great."
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:15.300]   And I remember the first guy that I brought to church, you know, and he was hooked on
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:20.900]   crack and so he would lose his shoes out on the street.
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:26.180]   So our church guys decided to celebrate his birthday and they bought him $120 Michael
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:27.180]   Jordan.
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.780]   $120 now may not sound like a lot of money, but back then it was like buying this guy
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:35.300]   who's hooked on crack, buying like $250, $300 pair of shoes.
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:36.300]   So it was exciting.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.580]   He was good at basketball, so he fit right in, you know.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:43.660]   And so we're doing that, but after a while, people start feeling uncomfortable because
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.060]   he doesn't have money.
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.980]   Every time we went out to eat, somebody had to spot him.
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:54.540]   I mean, it's one thing to have him and do mercy ministry out there, but it's another
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.660]   thing when we brought him into the church.
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:03.660]   And then when we brought him into my house, people who were like, "Oh yeah, Peter, that's
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:04.660]   great.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.940]   You know, you're doing mercy ministry, homeless ministry."
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:09.340]   And all of a sudden, it's like, "What are you doing?
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.340]   Is your wife okay with that?"
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:20.780]   As long as we're keeping our home safe, we can be generous.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:24.500]   As long as we're comfortable, as long as we have all that we need and out of abundance,
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.740]   okay, they can have it.
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:29.860]   And we're the same way when we go to short-term missions.
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:34.660]   We go out there and we're bold for Jesus Christ, out there.
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:39.620]   But we have such a hard time even mentioning Christianity to our coworkers.
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:44.700]   So we have a tendency to practice love from a safe distance.
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:56.300]   But this word, "As Christ in every way being God, did not consider equality with God something
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:00.920]   to be grasped, but he emptied himself, became nothing, and he walked among us."
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.420]   Imagine that.
[00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:07.020]   Imagine how uncomfortable it is for us to come out of our comfort zone and to be somewhere
[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.700]   that is uncomfortable.
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.620]   And so we avoid discomfort like a plague.
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:19.460]   Where we buy our house, where we work, where do we go, where we go on vacation, because
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.660]   we avoid discomfort like a plague.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:30.540]   This word, "Philisania," is a challenge to go beyond that, as Christ did for us, to bring
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:37.460]   them into not just our homes, but to break beyond our comfort zone, that our love would
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:42.060]   exceed and go beyond just the superficial.
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:47.100]   Now the Bible is not, I mean, there's nothing that says, "Oh, we can't help the poor.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.860]   We can't do this."
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:53.100]   But again, we need to understand biblically what he's talking about.
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:30:00.820]   Secondly, one, charity is to reflect his nature and who he is, and "Philisania" reflects that.
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.940]   But number two, and this is the part that I really want you guys to understand, because
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:10.900]   the way that social justice is being practiced today completely misses the mark of what the
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.540]   scripture teaches about this.
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:19.920]   Number two, we practice charity to advance the gospel.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.020]   We practice charity to advance the gospel.
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:29.340]   Never in the New Testament will you find where the church is challenged to go look out for
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:33.580]   homeless people out on the street.
[00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:37.740]   I'm going to explain that, and some of you guys are just like, "What?"
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:43.800]   Find me one passage in the Bible, and we'll have a conversation, where God calls the charity
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:50.460]   to help the poor outside of the context of the gospel being spread.
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:53.740]   Charity is to be practiced in the context of sharing the gospel.
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:58.340]   He said, "Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers."
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.660]   Now who are these strangers he's referring to?
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.420]   Was it just at that time, just a lot of homeless people just walking around, and he's saying
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:08.340]   just generically, if you find homeless people, that you would open up your home, bring them
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:09.340]   into your home.
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:12.240]   What is he referring to?
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.700]   If you know how things worked at that time, today, if we were going out of town, and we're
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:22.900]   going into the city, the first thing you would do is you would book your flight, book a hotel,
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:26.900]   find out the nice places to visit maybe, and then you find food, and then you come back
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:27.900]   home.
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:28.900]   That's kind of how it works.
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.340]   Then if you happen to have a friend there, you might go to their house just to save some
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.340]   money.
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:38.480]   Well, at that time, it was almost impossible to travel if you didn't have help from the
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.220]   villages that you went.
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:47.620]   When he says to show hospitality to strangers, and I'm going to prove my point through Scripture,
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.680]   that he is specifically referring to people who are coming into town in the context of
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:56.940]   sharing the gospel, just like Apostle Paul, just like all the apostles who went from village
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.060]   to village.
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:06.340]   When Jesus sent out his 12 disciples on a short-term mission trip, this is what he instructs
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:07.340]   them.
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:13.700]   Matthew 10, 40 to 42, "He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.600]   him who sent me.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.380]   He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward,
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:23.380]   and he who receives a righteous man in the name of the righteous man shall receive a
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.980]   righteous man's reward.
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:29.980]   And whoever in the name of the disciples gives to one of these little ones even a cup of
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:34.540]   cold water to drink, truly I say to you, he shall not lose his reward."
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:38.580]   He told his disciples that when you go on this mission trip, don't take food, don't
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:42.780]   take things because you're going to go in, and if they receive you, then bless this home,
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:46.980]   and if they don't receive you, shake off your dust and continue to go.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.300]   That was the culture at that time.
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:49.700]   This is not unique to the disciples.
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:55.840]   This is how information and the philosophers ended up spreading the right doctrine and
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.060]   even the wrong doctrine.
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:03.020]   So to receive a stranger means that you are receiving not only the stranger, but what
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.980]   he represents.
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:07.860]   That's what Jesus says.
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:14.380]   Now the negative part of that in 2 John 10-11, this is what he says, "If anyone comes to
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:19.460]   you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house and do not give
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:26.060]   him a greeting, for the one who gives him a greeting participates in his evil deeds."
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:31.420]   So to practice hospitality, meaning you bring somebody into your home, basically means to
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:34.220]   support their work.
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.260]   That's what that meant in that culture.
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:40.460]   So this was not devoid of the spreading of the gospel.
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:45.380]   In fact, he gives the same instruction in Luke chapter 10 when he sends out the 70 disciples,
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:49.500]   and he says, "When you go out, do not carry money or bags or shoes."
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:53.860]   And he says, "If they receive you, bless them, and then receive their help.
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:57.620]   If they don't, shake off your dust and go move on."
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:58.620]   That was the culture.
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:03.340]   And he says, to remember and be hospitable, he's telling within the context.
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:07.700]   Now this does not negate, it's not saying that we shouldn't help the poor whether they're
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.460]   Christians or not.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.180]   It's not negating that.
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:14.800]   But the priority is clear.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:20.740]   That charity is not a separate ministry from the gospel ministry, the way that it is being
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:22.620]   practiced today.
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:27.160]   Where you have mission department, and then we have a mercy department.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:30.000]   The church never separated these two things.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.540]   They went together hand in hand.
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:38.940]   I remember years ago when we first started going into India, and I asked Pastor Matthew,
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:42.700]   some of you guys who were with us, and I wanted to find out.
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:46.260]   I wanted to hear about his testimony because I kept on hearing about his testimony through
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.340]   his son.
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:52.020]   So I had an opportunity to talk to him, and I asked him, "What was it like early on?"
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:56.140]   Because he just went from village to village with his four small children to preach the
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.700]   gospel without any support.
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:05.420]   So he said, "Those guys who went to India with us, we're in a remote area in the city,
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:09.700]   but we have to take the van somewhere anywhere between an hour to two hours just to get into
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.520]   the village in a van."
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:16.660]   But with no support, he would walk from village to village.
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:22.620]   So him and his four children, who used to be a Hindu priest, and now he's excommunicated
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:26.860]   from his family, and he's just doing this on his own because God laid this burden to
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:27.860]   preach the gospel.
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.420]   And he told me that he would go to the village and he would share the gospel, and if they
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:36.820]   received him, they would feed them and they would house them.
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.780]   If they didn't receive them, sometimes they would be hassans, and they would throw rocks
[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.100]   at them to chew them away.
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.500]   And I would ask him, "So what would you do when that happened?"
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:50.780]   He said, "Well, we would just sleep out in the field, and we weren't able to eat.
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.420]   My children weren't able to eat that time."
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.620]   So in my mind, it's like, "This doesn't sound real.
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:59.500]   This is the kind of stuff that you read in history books."
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:04.620]   So I asked his children when I had time, just to kind of...
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:08.300]   I'm being a detective, trying to like, "Is this guy making this up?
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.300]   Is this real?"
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.640]   So I would ask these...
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:15.780]   And they would tell me, they said, "How much they hated going to these villages with his
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.860]   dad."
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:21.900]   Because they remember so vividly when they were children, sleeping out in the field and
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.840]   going hungry.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:28.940]   And so when they grew up, they determined not to follow Christ.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:32.820]   And all three of them became pastors.
[00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:38.060]   You guys know Pastor David, he was in pharmacy school, in the middle of that, he dropped
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:39.740]   out and became a pastor.
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.760]   And then the youngest daughter ended up marrying a pastor.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.620]   But they were telling me how much they hated going to village to village with their dad.
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:51.820]   And so I went and talked to Pastor Matthew, and I asked him, "Man, that must have been
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:52.820]   hard."
[00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:57.820]   And he said, "Yeah, I actually considered taking my life."
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:02.580]   I said, "That's a weird thing to say as a pastor."
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:03.820]   But he was just being honest with me.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:07.380]   He said, "At that time, I considered taking my life because this burden to preach the
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:13.220]   gospel was so heavy on him that he saw what it was doing to his family.
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:17.900]   He saw his children not being able to eat, sleeping out in the fields.
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:23.140]   And so he thought that if he disappeared, that this burden would be lifted from his
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.140]   family."
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:31.100]   And I was like, "Wow, I'm skeptical."
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.900]   So the first thing is like, "Is this real?"
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:40.780]   We were very slow to get involved with India because of my skepticism.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:44.860]   Through the years of interacting with these pastors, that's exactly how the gospel spread
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:46.800]   over there.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:51.380]   They went from village to village, walking without support, gospel spread.
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:56.060]   In fact, majority of human history, majority of the church history, the gospel spread in
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.280]   that way.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:03.100]   What you and I have now, just getting on an air-conditioned airplane, sometimes business
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.700]   class to get over there, sitting in a nice hotel while we're texting with our friends
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:11.340]   and taking selfies and putting it up and for people to see way over here, I mean, that's
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:17.260]   fantastic that we have the avenue to do that, but that's not how the gospel spread.
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:23.020]   For majority of human history, people picked up their cross, literally gave their life.
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:27.420]   Some of you guys are old enough to remember when we said bye to missionaries when we were
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.100]   children, we said bye.
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:33.020]   It was for good.
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.620]   Many of them couldn't afford airplane tickets, so they got on boats.
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.500]   Some of you guys were old enough to remember that.
[00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:44.060]   When they said bye, we all said bye, thinking we're not going to see them again.
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.980]   That's how the gospel spread.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:51.980]   He's talking within that context to be hospitable when they come into town.
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:59.980]   It is in that context he says, he says to them, he says, "Remember the prisoners as
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:05.060]   though in prison with them and those who are ill-treated since you yourself also are,"
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.060]   what?
[00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:07.060]   "In the body."
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.060]   Who are in prison?
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:12.020]   Is he just talking about anybody who committed a crime who happens to be in prison?
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.020]   No.
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:15.860]   He's referring to Christians who are being dragged in.
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:19.500]   The reason why they were drifting is because it became hard to be a Christian.
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:24.380]   And he's reminding them, remember, in Hebrews chapter 10, 32-35, "But remember the former
[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:28.940]   days when after being enlightened you endured great conflict and suffering, partly by being
[00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:33.620]   made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations, and partly by becoming sharers
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:37.020]   with those who were also mistreated.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:40.700]   For you showed sympathy to the prisoners, accepted joyfully the seizure of your property,
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.780]   knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and a lasting one.
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:47.460]   Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward."
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.500]   So he's not randomly saying, "Go visit prisoners."
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:55.320]   He's talking about Christians who have been caught and they are suffering for the purpose
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:59.420]   of their faith in the context of sharing the gospel.
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:03.940]   So the show of charity clearly is in the context of the gospel ministry.
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:10.300]   In Acts chapter 11, verse 29, Paul says, "And in proportion that any of the disciples had
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:17.060]   means, each of them determined to send a contribution for the relief of the brethren living in Judea.
[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:21.500]   Romans 15, 26, "For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.900]   poor among the saints in Jerusalem."
[00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:27.860]   First Corinthians 16, 1, "Now considering the collection for the saints as I directed
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:31.460]   in churches of Galatia, so you do also the same for the saints."
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:35.540]   Second Corinthians 8, 3-4, "For I testify that according to their ability and beyond
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:40.180]   their ability, they gave of their own accord, begging us with much urging for the favor
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:42.820]   of participation in the support of," what?
[00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:44.860]   "Of the saints."
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:50.580]   Repeatedly over and over and over again, every challenge for us to practice charity is within
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:54.660]   the context of spreading the gospel.
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.780]   They're not two separate events.
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:02.580]   They're the same thing.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:08.340]   We are called to be charitable, to reflect who He is.
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:14.700]   One of the texts that we probably use the most to challenge churches to be mindful of
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:21.020]   those who are in need is found in Matthew chapter 25, and you know the text.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:25.540]   The text goes, "He who has done it unto the least of my children has done it unto me."
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:30.580]   He who has done it basically has done it unto me, right?
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:35.420]   And we use that text in saying, like, when you see the poor and you take care of them,
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:39.980]   that this is our way of showing support to our God, right?
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:47.580]   Which is not wrong, but if you remember in Matthew chapter 24, what's Matthew chapter
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:49.820]   24?
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:54.420]   It's Jesus' final teaching about the end times, and this is where He says that all
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:59.260]   the tribulations, all these things are coming, and persecution is coming, and He says, "Because
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:02.700]   there's going to be increase in wickedness, the love of most will grow cold."
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:07.980]   And in chapter 25, He goes into the parable of the end times.
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:12.660]   And so it's in that context, the last thing that He says is here.
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:17.140]   So the context of this parable, the context of this teaching is preparing for the coming
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:21.900]   of Christ and being faithful and sharing the good news of Jesus Christ, and it's in that
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:26.100]   context that Jesus says in verse 35, "For I was hungry and you gave me something to
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:27.100]   eat.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.980]   I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink.
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:31.100]   I was stranger and you invited me in.
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.220]   Naked and you clothed me.
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:33.700]   I was sick and you visited me.
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.340]   I was in prison and you came to me."
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:40.380]   Then the righteous will answer Him, "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.540]   thirsty and give you something to drink?
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:46.820]   And when did we see you stranger and invite you in, or naked and clothed you?
[00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:52.380]   When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?"
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:56.060]   Jesus responds in verse 30, "The king will answer and say to them, 'Truly I say to you,
[00:42:56.060 --> 00:43:02.580]   to the extent that you did it to one of these, what, brothers of mine, even the least of
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:06.700]   them, you did it to me.'"
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:12.700]   He's telling us this in the context of the gospel ministry, being faithful, to be fruitful.
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:18.620]   And at the end, as we are being faithful, He who has received them are hospitable, visited
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:22.460]   them while they were in prison, while they were suffering for His name.
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:27.100]   He says, "Do not forget them."
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:32.700]   Does this mean that He is telling us that we don't need to worry about those who are
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.100]   suffering who aren't Christians?
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:37.440]   Absolutely not.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.100]   Because we are to reflect His grace.
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:42.260]   We are to reflect His mercy for us.
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:48.380]   But the primary call to Christians and to the church to be charitable is in the context
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:51.500]   of the gospel going out.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:57.980]   Because until people are transformed and regenerated with the gospel of Jesus Christ, thinking
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:03.460]   that we are somehow going to move somebody from homelessness to homelessness, that we've
[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.480]   solved the problem.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:11.020]   The problem with sex trafficking isn't simply the lust of certain men.
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.260]   It's all interconnected.
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:20.220]   Poverty, sex trafficking, homelessness, political unrest, these are not disconnected from each
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.500]   other.
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.900]   The Bible says that sin, when it came in, it reigns over mankind.
[00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:28.260]   It has not just affected one thing.
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:29.700]   It affected our relationships.
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.580]   It affected our marriages.
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:38.380]   It affected our economy, our politics, our sense of right and wrong, the rich and poor.
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:41.300]   It affected everything.
[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:46.680]   Until the gospel comes into an individual's life and there is a transformation that takes
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:53.100]   place in their heart and in their lives, they will not and cannot practice the charity that
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:56.300]   He calls us to practice.
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.660]   We can be slightly generous.
[00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:02.100]   We can be good moral people.
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:08.280]   But the love that He tells us to practice can only be practiced by those who are recipients
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:13.620]   of this love.
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:17.860]   We need to be charitable to reflect who He is.
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:26.380]   We also need to be charitable and engage in the ministry that God called us to.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:33.540]   I have shared with you, like every once in a while I'll share with you, about the persecution
[00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:36.100]   that's going on around the world.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:42.260]   I'm not telling you this just so that you can feel bad or just so that you can have
[00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:44.620]   information.
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:48.540]   That the calling that He has given us, that in the context of sharing the gospel, that
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:52.980]   you and I, whether they live in North Korea, whether they live in India or China, that
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.900]   we are all connected as brothers in Christ.
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:59.660]   That even though we may not know them, they are our neighbors.
[00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:02.180]   And as they suffer, we ought to suffer with them.
[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:07.380]   As they pray, as they are spreading the gospel, we ought to pray with them.
[00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:14.420]   But our tendency, if we're not careful, is to, "I don't see them.
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:18.140]   Because I don't see them, they're not my neighbor."
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:23.140]   I remember years ago, I had a sister in the church, years ago, and I think this is one
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:28.500]   of the most honest confessions that I've heard.
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:32.380]   We were on this topic of talking about mercy ministry and about caring for the poor and
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:33.980]   how people are suffering.
[00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:39.980]   And she said to me, honestly, "I didn't know."
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:41.440]   And that was not her confession.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.820]   It was what she said after that.
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:47.980]   She said, "I didn't know because I didn't want to know.
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:51.300]   Because it made me feel uncomfortable.
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:56.180]   Because every time I hear about the suffering of our brothers and sisters around the world,
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.700]   I would feel guilty."
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:03.620]   And so she said, every time information would come, she would either ignore it or give a
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:04.620]   glazed look.
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:05.620]   And then she said, "Well, I didn't.
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:06.620]   I claim ignorance."
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:08.660]   So ignorance is bliss.
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.460]   And so she was confessing that to me.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:13.860]   She said, "I didn't know, but it was deliberate.
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:14.980]   Because I didn't.
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:18.420]   I hardened my heart on purpose."
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:21.820]   You know, I've been preaching long enough to know.
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.060]   And I could be wrong.
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:27.780]   I've been preaching long enough to be able to see in your face whether the Word of God
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.620]   is getting into you or not.
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:33.580]   Okay, now all of you are faking it.
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:34.580]   Right?
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:39.780]   Because you can tell, when the Word of God is preached, it makes some people uncomfortable.
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:44.320]   And there is a glazed look because they don't want to know.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.740]   And so it's better to kind of have a vague understanding of who God is.
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:49.980]   A vague understanding of mercy and love.
[00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:53.700]   Because we don't want God's Spirit coming into.
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:59.140]   Like I will meet God in the porch, but not inside the house.
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:04.380]   Maybe I'll invite Him into the living room, but I don't want Him to see my bedroom.
[00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:08.260]   Maybe I'll allow it, but don't open the closet.
[00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:13.820]   And so we have a tendency to deliberately remain in ignorance and keep God at distance
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:17.820]   because it makes us feel uncomfortable.
[00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:27.940]   That word, hospital, love of strangers, hospitality, is to go beyond just a superficial band-aid.
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:34.700]   And to recognize that He, in every way God, consider equality with God not to be grasped,
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:36.740]   but He emptied Himself, became nothing.
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:38.140]   He walked among us.
[00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:41.420]   We usually think about His suffering on the cross.
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:45.900]   But Him, the King of kings and Lord of lords, just walking among us, putting on flesh.
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:48.140]   Imagine how uncomfortable that is.
[00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:53.260]   How much does it take for us to even just get on our knees to talk to little children?
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.660]   When we're in neighborhoods that we're not familiar with.
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:49:00.600]   When we have food that we're not familiar with.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:01.600]   How uncomfortable.
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:07.260]   It's hard for us to be humble, even with our wives and our husbands.
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:14.420]   Jesus stepped off of His throne and walked among us, humiliated Himself, in order that
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:18.620]   you and I can be saved.
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:22.700]   That's what He's calling us to do.
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:24.840]   To examine.
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:31.020]   To live in such a way where His love is being reflected above us.
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:36.220]   Non-Christians practice love for their brothers and sisters, for their children, for their
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.540]   friends.
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.580]   That's not Christian love.
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:40.580]   That's just love.
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:44.580]   Christian love is what He's talking about here.
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:47.660]   This is why we got involved with India.
[00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:49.780]   I had a friend who asked me to come out to India.
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.860]   You were heavily involved with China, and we're busy here.
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:58.620]   I went to India because he asked me to go and preach and to train the pastors who were
[00:49:58.620 --> 00:49:59.620]   there.
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:01.380]   I happened to go because I wanted to connect with him.
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:05.020]   Then while I was in India, my eyes got opened.
[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:09.220]   The way it got opened was I found out the heaviest concentration of unreached people
[00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:12.180]   groups were in India.
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.180]   I didn't know that.
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:18.640]   I always thought it was a 1040 window in the Middle East, and I found out it was in India.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:22.580]   The heaviest concentration of poverty was also in India.
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:23.660]   I didn't know that.
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:26.660]   I thought it was somewhere in Africa.
[00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:30.060]   Heaviest concentration of illiteracy in the villages, right?
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:33.020]   There's parts of India that's getting very wealthy.
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:38.340]   But the heaviest concentration of poverty was also in India.
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:45.780]   I found out that the heaviest concentration of sex trafficking was also in India.
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:47.860]   I wanted to know.
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:52.460]   Even though I didn't have a heart, God opened the door and said, "Okay, I could either
[00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:55.300]   say no or I could at least get engaged."
[00:50:55.300 --> 00:51:00.560]   It just happened that we had connection with the pastors, and we went.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.420]   We went to an area where it was uncovered.
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:06.100]   Some of you guys were with us when we went.
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:09.900]   Since we've gone there, I can honestly tell you that some of the things that we've experienced
[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:15.700]   and seen, and it helped me to understand what was going on in the early church.
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:23.940]   I remember in one village in particular, we were doing our work, and I could hear there's
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:29.860]   a buzz, and some of the pastors came and ran to get me, said, "We need your prayers."
[00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:32.700]   So I went with the pastors, and I could see this young lady, and she must have been no
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:35.420]   more than about 25, 26 years old.
[00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:41.400]   She had a very limp child in her arms, probably no more than about three to four months old.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:46.260]   The child was breathing, but you could tell it was struggling to breathe.
[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:47.260]   She's desperate.
[00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:50.240]   She doesn't know what to do.
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:55.820]   So she basically was asking us to pray, pray for this child, for a miracle.
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:52:01.140]   As we were trying to hear the story, and obviously all of us, the pastors that called me to that,
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:06.740]   we were all compelled, but we're also very saddened because we could tell whether the
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:11.180]   child lives another few days or a few months, that it wasn't going to make it.
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:12.680]   It was already too late.
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:21.500]   But what really was heart-wrenching was that the problem that this child had was a very
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.620]   simple problem.
[00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:31.940]   That if she had access to the hospital early on, the baby would not be in this position.
[00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:37.020]   And she was in tears, and as we were praying, she was crying, the pastors were crying.
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:40.660]   And after we prayed, we gave her the hope, but at the end of the day, it was already
[00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:41.660]   too late for the child.
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:45.820]   And the whole time I was thinking, if this was in the United States, it would have just
[00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:48.540]   been one run to the hospital, and that's it.
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:54.020]   But because she didn't have access, her child was going to die.
[00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:58.940]   We were in Romania one year, and we were out in the remotest parts, and this older lady
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:06.480]   came out, and we found a big hole in the side of one of her legs because of the infection.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:09.380]   And then she said she had the same problem on the other leg, so we opened that up because
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:13.500]   we had medical workers there with us, and the nurse looked at it and said, "This is
[00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:15.620]   really bad."
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:20.380]   And most likely, in order to save her, that she has to amputate her legs.
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:22.620]   And so we asked her, "What caused this?"
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:25.860]   And she said it was a mosquito bite.
[00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:27.940]   She was out in the field, and she got bit by a mosquito.
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:29.020]   She didn't know how to take care of it.
[00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:35.060]   She had no access to medicine, and all she probably needed earlier on was some antibiotics,
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:38.640]   but she didn't have any access.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:42.940]   So we didn't know if she was going to be able to live or not.
[00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:45.820]   After we left, was she going to be able to go to the hospital, even the amputation is
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:48.320]   going to cost a lot of money.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:52.840]   And I remember coming back from that trip thinking, "Wow, over here you get bit by
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:53.840]   a mosquito.
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:57.260]   I mean, it'd be a joke."
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:04.900]   But we have brothers and sisters around the world who are dying because of mosquito bites.
[00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:12.860]   We have children dying in their mother's arms because they don't have access to a
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:15.460]   hospital.
[00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:20.260]   If you remember, also in India, there was this young lady, another lady, and they might
[00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:22.560]   have been on the same trip.
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:26.360]   The pastor asked me to pray for her again.
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:27.860]   And her story was a little bit different.
[00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:35.540]   He said that she became a Christian, and she joined the church, and her family was infuriated
[00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:38.480]   that she became a Christian.
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:43.380]   And soon after she became a Christian, her husband fell into some kind of illness, and
[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.600]   he ended up dying.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.980]   And as a result of that, the family blamed her.
[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:53.220]   They said, "Tragedy came into our home because you disrespected our God."
[00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:57.460]   And so they disowned her and basically kicked her and her children out.
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:01.140]   So she had no means to live.
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:06.100]   Some of you guys may remember, I came back and I asked and collected some funds to send
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:08.500]   it over.
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:12.440]   And all we did, it wasn't a ton of money.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:16.020]   Some of you guys were very generous, so we sent the money back and asked the pastor to
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:18.180]   make sure that she's taken care of.
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:21.900]   And because she was taken care of, she had enough to not only feed herself, she started
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:27.980]   feeding her in-laws, because her husband was a primary breadwinner.
[00:55:27.980 --> 00:55:35.420]   And as a result of the generosity, her in-laws not only received her back, her in-laws called
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:37.940]   the pastors.
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:43.120]   They called the pastors and asked, "Tell me about your God."
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:46.180]   And they were able to share the gospel with the in-laws, and that whole family came to
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:51.260]   faith as a result of some of your generosity.
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:57.260]   You guys remember that story?
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:03.180]   The gospel ministry and the mercy ministry are not separate things.
[00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:10.580]   He calls us to be charitable, to be gracious, to be merciful.
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:20.260]   We cannot live in a world with all the resources that you and I have, and to plan all of that
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:27.860]   for our selfish gain, and somehow think that we are being the aroma of Christ.
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:32.060]   But it is not justice that he calls, it's charity.
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:33.620]   Charity.
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:38.300]   We must live with charity.
[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:44.580]   Not simply because they're hungry, not simply because people are in need, because it gives
[00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:49.860]   us a platform to tell them about Jesus Christ.
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:54.300]   What's happening right now isn't biblical.
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:56.580]   Let me make that clear.
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:57:02.980]   What's sweeping the world in our generation that has penetrated into this church, or churches
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:06.300]   in general, is not biblical.
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:13.700]   And I want to warn you and I want to encourage you, because so many false teachings that
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:20.580]   is only skewed just a little bit, that sometimes is hard to tell, is penetrating into the church
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:25.060]   in every which way, that you have to be Bereans.
[00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:26.740]   You have to be.
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:29.060]   You have to test everything to make sure.
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:30.060]   Don't quote me.
[00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:32.100]   It is not safe.
[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:33.860]   Don't quote some pastor.
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:35.940]   Don't tell me you read this in a book.
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:38.500]   Don't tell me that this is what church history practiced.
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:41.260]   Don't tell me all your other Christian friends believe this.
[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:48.260]   You must not turn from the Word of God to the left or to the right.
[00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:49.860]   Test what I say.
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:54.580]   Examine the passage that I quoted and make sure that it's the voice of God that we're
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:58.640]   following, not the movement of our generation.
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:04.900]   So yes, in conclusion, we must be charitable for the sake of His name.
[00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:09.260]   And I got, remember I told you I had this slogan that I live with and I used to pound
[00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:10.660]   the pulpit back then.
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:17.300]   How can you worship a homeless man on Sunday and not worship him, you know, and forget
[00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:18.500]   a homeless man on Monday?
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.660]   I got another slogan, right?
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:24.180]   I picked up from a friend a while back and this is the slogan.
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:27.780]   And I'm not going to explain it to you, so if you don't get it, let it sink in and then
[00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:29.060]   ask somebody, okay?
[00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:32.300]   So hopefully discussion will take place.
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:37.060]   If your face is bigger than your cause, then your face is too big.
[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:42.460]   Okay, let me say that again.
[00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:50.160]   If your face is bigger than your cause, then your face is too big.
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:57.820]   If you are compelled when you see the poor, if you're ignited and you have compassion,
[00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:03.180]   then preach the gospel in season and out of season.
[00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:07.100]   Let's pray.
[00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:10.140]   I'm going to pray for us as our worship team leads.
[00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:14.460]   And usually I'll just give a few minutes for you, but I want to pray for all of us.
[00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:20.780]   And then after our worship team comes, we'll finish with the final song.
[00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:21.780]   Let me pray for us.
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:22.780]   Let's pray.
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:29.780]   Heavenly Father, we thank you that we live in a country that's free.
[00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:33.300]   We thank you that our children are taken care of.
[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:39.260]   We thank you, Lord God, that we have wealth that others do not have.
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:45.140]   To live in a warm home, not to worry about what we're going to feed our children each
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:46.140]   day.
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:52.300]   To be able to gather in a nice building without concern of a physical threat.
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:56.820]   Help us, Lord God, to be good stewards of everything that you've given us.
[00:59:56.820 --> 01:00:00.460]   Help us, Lord, to open our eyes to see the suffering around us, Lord God, that we do
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:04.260]   not insulate ourselves from the suffering of the world.
[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:08.940]   As you saw the multitudes, Lord, and you had compassion on them because they were like
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:12.800]   sheep without shepherd being tossed back and forth.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:16.740]   As you pleaded with your disciples, Lord, to beseech the Lord of the harvest to send
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:18.140]   out more workers.
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:24.540]   Lord, we beseech you that you would raise up men and women, Lord God, even in this congregation,
[01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:30.320]   that you would help us to take our eyes off of ourselves and know, Father God, that eternity
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:36.660]   is coming, that we would not be satisfied with our bills being paid, with our children
[01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:43.380]   being safe, but that we would truly live to proclaim the gospel to the fullest.
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:50.980]   Lord, that those who are suffering, those who are lost, those who are hungry, those
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:57.420]   who are orphaned, Lord, that they may know that there is hope in your name.
[01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:00.740]   Lord, ignite our hearts.
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:03.740]   Soften our hearts, Lord God.
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:10.620]   Help us to see our wealth, Lord God, not to be a trap, but to be used, Lord God, for the
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.580]   sake of your name.
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:16.460]   I pray for my brothers and sisters who are around the world, Lord God, who are suffering
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:20.820]   because they have boldness and courage to stand up for their faith.
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:24.700]   Give them the faith that they need, strength that they need, Lord God, to stand up even
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:29.340]   for their life, that their testimony would bring others to Christ.
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:36.220]   Lord, we pray for the North Koreans, Lord God, who are in secret reading your word and
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:39.980]   praying to you in fear of their own lives.
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:44.680]   Give them courage to know.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:50.540]   Give them courage to know, Father God, that you are their refuge, that whether they live
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:57.380]   here for a long time or a short time, that eternity is coming, that when you come in
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:00.220]   glory that they will also be glorified.
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:05.540]   Lord, we pray for our brothers and sisters who are hungry around the world.
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:09.020]   We pray for the young ladies, Lord God, who are being violated, Lord, because of this
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:10.500]   sinful world.
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:16.860]   Lord, give us compassion for them as you had compassion for us.
[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:23.420]   Help us, Lord God, to intercede on their behalf, that we would be broken, that we would be
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:26.980]   on our knees, Lord God, crying out.
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:34.900]   Lord, help us, help us, Lord God, to break away from this rat race, this temptation to
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:40.300]   think, Lord, that if we have nice homes and nice cars, that we're good.
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:43.020]   Teach us what it means to love aliens.
[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:50.700]   Lord, give us broken hearts, that we may pray effectively, we may live purposefully, that
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:55.900]   your name may be honored, that eternity will be more real to us than ever.
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:58.700]   Lord, bring revival.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:02:59.700]   Revive us.
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.380]   Revive this church.
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:02.380]   Revive this generation.
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:06.100]   May Christ and his name be exalted through us.
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.140]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
