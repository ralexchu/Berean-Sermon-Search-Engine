[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:09.240]   - Hello, church family.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.140]   Would you please take a moment to pray with me
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.140]   as we jump into God's word,
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.840]   continue the study, the book of Ephesians.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.680]   Let's pray.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.640]   Our God, we thank you so much
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.200]   that so far in the study of the book of Ephesians,
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.120]   we have been hearing and learning
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.280]   about your incredible love that has been lavished upon us.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.840]   God, we have been learning about your intent,
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.000]   your heart's desire, and the goal that you have
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.240]   to show forth your rich, rich mercies.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.480]   And I pray, God, that by faith we would hear and receive,
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.440]   and by faith, God, we would respond with gratitude,
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.800]   and God, we continue on to study.
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.640]   Amen.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.720]   I pray that your spirit would bless our heart, our mind,
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.680]   and cause us, Father, Lord, to live by faith,
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.440]   that perhaps though our lives may be discouraging,
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.280]   full of worry, and God, constantly a threat,
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.680]   Lord, that we absolutely trust in you.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.080]   Lord, God, we lift up a prayer for all those individuals
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.740]   going through difficult times right now,
[00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.720]   going through worrisome moments.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.800]   We pray, Father, that you would encourage them,
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.240]   and you, Lord, in your very presence,
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.880]   we would be their solid rock.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.660]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.500]   Amen.
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.360]   Well, as we continue the study of Ephesians,
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.240]   we want to take a moment to review again.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.320]   In the previous passage in chapter two,
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.160]   we finished off a segment that really highlighted
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.960]   different elements of the gospel, right?
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.360]   In the beginning portion of chapter two,
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.000]   we recall that Apostle Paul showed us who we were before,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.040]   that prior to, we were formerly absolutely dead
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.240]   in our transgressions and sins.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.340]   And he showed us that we were objects of wrath,
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.040]   children of wrath, and just like the rest, right,
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.580]   complete in disobedience and suppressed
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.600]   by so many evil forces.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.560]   And then to teach us that we've been made alive in Christ.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.920]   And then in the second half of that chapter,
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.040]   he showed us that formerly we were completely far off,
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.880]   but now we've been brought near by the blood of Christ.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.480]   And at the tail end of that,
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.480]   Apostle Paul turned from the personal salvation in Christ,
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.720]   and he turned to what that means for us collectively
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.800]   as a church, what God is doing through all of that,
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.600]   and the ramifications of what that makes us.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.180]   And what we learned was that God was causing us
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.360]   to be built up together as a household of God.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.960]   Metaphorically and spiritually,
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.080]   we're supposed to be a temple,
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.140]   and surprisingly, he said,
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.220]   in connecting us to the many saints of old,
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.520]   that we were going to be the dwelling place spiritually
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.680]   for the Lord.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.040]   And so that to us is actually a magnificent,
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.520]   you can say an incredibly epic, epic privilege
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.480]   that we would desire to be near,
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.840]   or that God would even desire to be near us.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.800]   So with that said, we take a look at the structure
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.180]   of what our passage says today.
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.080]   Now, before I read our passage,
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.080]   I want to highlight that there is an interesting structure
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.520]   to this because there is a pause and a break.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.800]   What I mean by that is, verse one,
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.920]   Apostle Paul begins this thought.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.000]   For this reason, I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.480]   for the sake of you Gentiles, and then he pauses.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.240]   So it's an incomplete beginning portion of a thought
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.540]   saying essentially, I'm praying for you,
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.880]   but then he stops.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.600]   And that thought actually picks up later on in verse 14.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   So it's not going to be for another two weeks
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.240]   that we're going to actually get to
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.880]   the thought he introduces.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.880]   And essentially, the introductory thought
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.280]   is that he is praying for us
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.400]   so that we would know all the things
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.180]   that he is talking about.
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.120]   So then there is this weird, interesting section
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.040]   in verse 2 to 13, where he takes a parenthetical pause.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.720]   But in this pause, we read,
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.240]   essentially, Apostle Paul wants to make sure
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.800]   that we actually have heard and understand.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.000]   And so he essentially, in my own way, I like to hear,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.720]   I like to say, Apostle Paul asks the question,
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.440]   did you really hear me?
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.640]   He's taking a moment's pause to say,
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.520]   if indeed this is actually true of you,
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.360]   that you heard this stuff.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.020]   And so let's take a moment to read our passage.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.800]   The word on the screen is going to be a bit small,
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.740]   so please make sure you follow along in your Bibles.
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.280]   He says this, "For this reason, I, Paul,
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.100]   "the prisoner of Christ Jesus,
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.100]   "for the sake of you Gentiles,
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.080]   "if indeed you have heard of the stewardship
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.460]   "of God's grace, which was given to me for you,
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.840]   "that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery,
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.980]   "as I wrote, which in other generations
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.280]   "was not made known to the sons of men,
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.020]   "as it now has been revealed to his holy apostles
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.440]   "and prophets in the spirit.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.940]   "To be specific, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.620]   "and fellow members of the body,
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.460]   "and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.240]   "through the gospel, of which I was made a minister
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.580]   "according to the gift of God's grace,
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.480]   "which was given to me according to the working
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.880]   "of his power."
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.640]   Now this next section we're going to study in the next week,
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.720]   but let me read it for the full context of the passage.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.100]   He says, "To me, the very least of all saints,
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.800]   "this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.080]   "the unfathomable riches of Christ,
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.400]   "and to bring to light what is the administration
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.420]   "of the mystery, which for ages has been hidden in God,
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.180]   "who created all things, so that the manifold wisdom of God
[00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.280]   "might now be made known through the church
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.400]   "to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.480]   "This was in accordance with the eternal purpose
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.320]   "which he carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.060]   "in whom we have boldness and confident access
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.660]   "through faith in him.
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.940]   "Therefore, I ask you not to lose heart
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.200]   "at my tribulations on your behalf,
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.660]   "for they are your glory."
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.900]   So as we take a look at that,
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.420]   I want to give you an essentially an overview structure,
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.080]   'cause essentially we need to see that overview, right?
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.080]   And what you see here, again, I mentioned
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.000]   that verse two to 13, two to 14, you could arguably say,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.420]   is a parenthetical pause to take a moment
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.880]   to think about what has been said.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.960]   He says at the beginning portion of this passage,
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.960]   "For this reason," right?
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.560]   And when he says, "For this reason,"
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.600]   he is talking about all the incredible truth
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.420]   that he has already expounded on and explained so far.
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.220]   So far, he's been telling us
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.160]   that the gospel that has been given to us is so rich,
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.980]   that the blessings of God are so many.
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.760]   It's been lavished upon us.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.500]   And what's more, those blessings has such intentionality,
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.300]   but also a meticulous plan to it,
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.540]   to the degree that God is causing us to be built up
[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.880]   into a unique house, a dwelling place of God.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.680]   And therefore, he says, he's praying for us.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.640]   Now, after saying that,
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.520]   within this parenthetical statement,
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.080]   essentially he says, "If then indeed,
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.660]   "you've heard the stewardship of God's grace,
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.880]   "which was given to me for you."
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.760]   Essentially what he's doing then is,
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.920]   he's taking a moment to pause.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.920]   And what he's expecting is that we, the hearers,
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.640]   and the church that is his immediate audience,
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.800]   as a matter of fact, actually heard and understand.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.700]   And so I highlight for you those specific statements
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.640]   in verse two, "If indeed you have heard,"
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.240]   and what's more, verse four, "By referring to this,"
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.600]   he's saying, "By saying this,
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.360]   "when you read, you can understand."
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.680]   Okay, I wanna take a moment to reflect
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.760]   and meditate on that a little bit.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.640]   Because sometimes there is a need for us to pause
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.340]   and ask, do I really understand what he's saying?
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.080]   Do I sufficiently, I know I'm not gonna understand
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.400]   everything, but do I sufficiently appreciate?
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.440]   Am I impacted, am I actually moved
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.680]   by what he's been saying?
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.320]   Because that is exactly what he's doing, is it not?
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.460]   When he challenges the hearer, essentially,
[00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.540]   by saying, "If you actually heard,
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.800]   "and by saying this, that you might read and understand."
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.640]   And so what's really interesting is,
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.040]   he says, "If you understand this mystery."
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.200]   And what I see in this passage is Apostle Paul
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.000]   essentially doing a quick stack up.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.600]   And the reason why I say it's a stack up
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.640]   is because there are a couple of statements
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.600]   just to stack up on each other.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.600]   If you really heard the stewardship of God's grace,
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.760]   which was given to me for you,
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.640]   this revelation that was made known to,
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.280]   sorry, that by revelation,
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.280]   there was made known to me the revelation.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.840]   I wrote this before.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.120]   By referring to this, I know you should be able
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.640]   to read and to understand.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.560]   And so essentially, there's a stack up,
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.040]   this kind of like repeated, same kind of message,
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.800]   a statement that perhaps doesn't need to be repeated,
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.360]   but he does so for the sake of effect.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.440]   Do you actually understand what I'm saying to you?
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.720]   Okay, so let's take a moment just from the get-go
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.040]   to meditate upon that, because I believe
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.200]   this is the purpose why Apostle Paul
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.440]   takes a parenthetical pause.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.840]   That's what he's actually trying to do.
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.840]   Do you understand?
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.760]   Right?
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.440]   I mean, for us too, we can actually say
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.000]   that in many ways, we hear,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.880]   especially the gospel being expounded in many ways,
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.960]   different facets of the gospel being highlighted to us.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.160]   And is it always the case
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.240]   that we understand on first hearing?
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.400]   Is it always the case that we actually receive it
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.480]   and appreciate it as we ought to?
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.720]   Probably not.
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.800]   So actually, it's good for us to take a moment to pause
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.040]   and ask the question, do I really understand
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.480]   and receive everything that we've been saying?
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.920]   And now take a moment to think about this.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.160]   Earlier, I did a quick review,
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.400]   but my question to you is,
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   are you able to really meditate, chew on,
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.360]   and have that kind of thought reverberating in your minds
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.040]   about all the things that was already taught us
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.720]   in chapter one and two?
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.480]   So far, we've had so much teaching.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.640]   We've had eight weeks of teaching
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.560]   on the incredible blessings of God
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.160]   that has come through Christ,
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.600]   that everything is in Him.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.440]   To me, they were like mind-blowing moments.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.360]   If you actually took time to sit and then think,
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.840]   to think about how intentional God is with His love,
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.120]   that none of this is by happenstance.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.840]   None of this is by us saying,
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.080]   God, I have this great idea.
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.800]   If you could only do this for me,
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.800]   then it would be really great.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.880]   Well, that's not how it's working, is it?
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.880]   From before we were born,
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.680]   God had designed His salvation,
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.440]   and His redemption has been meticulously unfolded
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.360]   throughout the passing of time.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.880]   And what's more, we studied
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.320]   how God lavishly exercised His power towards us,
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.640]   His grace towards us, His strength towards us,
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.720]   and ultimately that He would unite us with Christ
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.480]   so that in Christ, we would die in our sin,
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.560]   we would die in our bondage, and we'd be made alive.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.320]   We studied how we were so dead,
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.720]   and yet, and we were also,
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.640]   because of that deadness, relationally so far,
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.200]   but in the great mercies of God,
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.080]   He's made us alive and He's brought us together.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.880]   Now, I'm repeating certain things again myself,
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:38.160]   but my question is, if after hearing all that stuff,
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.880]   let's say that our hearts have this little bit
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.840]   of a shrugs mentality.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.000]   Let's say our minds aren't actually,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.680]   I mean, it's not so much that your mind
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.440]   has to be blown every single time,
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.640]   but shouldn't there be a stirring?
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.760]   Shouldn't there be an appreciation?
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.200]   Shouldn't there be a wonder of like, whoa, right?
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.120]   A bare minimum.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.560]   But if there is perhaps a sentiment where we say,
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.560]   "And you have access to God,
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:12.560]   "and you kind of, okay, heard that, I get it,"
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.200]   then perhaps we don't understand.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.240]   Then perhaps we don't actually get it.
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.000]   And the thing about it is,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.400]   I think this is a good moment to check our hearts,
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.240]   because I don't think Apostle Paul is just pointing
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.400]   at our ears and asking the question, "Did you hear me?"
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.920]   Like, for example, when we were young,
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.240]   and our parents looked at us and said, "Did you hear me?"
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.720]   I'm pretty sure they weren't asking
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.520]   if our ears are defective,
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.960]   if our ear drums were hurt, right?
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.920]   'Cause the fact of the matter is,
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.040]   there are so many reasons why sometimes
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.600]   we actually don't hear.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.280]   Again, like children, sometimes we just simply don't hear
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.040]   because we're absolutely preoccupied
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.920]   with the stuff that we're doing.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.440]   And as a matter of fact, perhaps we might have even said,
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.720]   someone yelled a command to us,
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.880]   someone called for our name,
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.720]   and was like, "You know what?
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.120]   "Sorry, I was too busy.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.280]   "I was caught up in my own thing."
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.760]   Is that, for us, where we are?
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.320]   Perhaps sometimes we might hear something else,
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.240]   but before responding, we look around,
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.480]   are other people responding?
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.200]   And maybe that's us.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.880]   We're always playing the safe card,
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.720]   and looking to see,
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.800]   are other people taking this really seriously?
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.560]   This idea that because you were absolutely dead,
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.160]   your life is completely belonging to Christ,
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.800]   and you owe everything to Him,
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.280]   and that you are now a slave of God Almighty?
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.760]   Let's see if other people do that first, right?
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.320]   I mean, if you ever have had siblings,
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.160]   sometimes you do that.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.960]   Like, let's see if my older brother will go first, right?
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.760]   Sometimes we just don't think it's important.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.200]   We have other pressing matters.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.240]   Those are all like worldview issues.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.120]   Those are all heart issues.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.480]   And we want to make this a point for us,
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.840]   that if he's taking a parenthetical moment,
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.840]   a pause in his, as he's saying,
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.240]   "I'm praying, I'm working for you.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.240]   "I'm a servant of this cause to bring you into the church,
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.920]   "and cause you to be one unto God."
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.880]   And he's like, "Wait, I need to make sure.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.640]   "Did you hear me?"
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.040]   And let's ask the question, did I hear God?
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.040]   Chapters one through two,
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.200]   did I really appreciate everything that has been said?
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.560]   Or is there a weird, strange, perhaps hardened heart
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.880]   that says, "It's the big deal.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.920]   "I've heard that a thousand times.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.240]   "How does that help me?
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.760]   "Whoop-de-doo."
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.960]   And if we're thinking that way,
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.680]   we absolutely have to check our hearts.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.400]   Why, if we actually believe we were the scum of the earth,
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.640]   destined for wrath and to be burned,
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.880]   and yet we were invited into the household of God,
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.960]   why does that not affect me?
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.640]   Why does that not make my heart all the more thirsty
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.040]   for this great love that God has?
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.480]   What's going on?
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.440]   Now, this really matters.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.200]   This really matters.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.480]   Not just because of for us,
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.480]   because I think that if what God is doing here
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.160]   is properly understood as Apostle Paul is understanding it,
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.400]   then there is absolute good reason
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.640]   why Apostle Paul is making sure that we understand.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.360]   Because if we don't get it,
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.040]   then we may be offending God.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.080]   We may be offending God.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:26.080]   Sometimes our world, our personal view of self,
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.680]   and our view of the world is so narcissistic.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.760]   It's so focused, we have no idea what we're doing to God.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.920]   It's like that when we're kids.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.080]   Sometimes we say things,
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.080]   we have no idea how it hurts our parents,
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.960]   has no idea how it hurts our spouses,
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.800]   has no idea how it hurts our friends.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.200]   It could be like that with us and God.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.040]   That relationally, if God is revealing to us
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.760]   so far in chapters one and two,
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.680]   how much he has poured out in his strength,
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.640]   in his love, and in his power to love us.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.720]   And yet, if any bit of that
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.560]   just completely goes over our heads,
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.800]   it completely goes in one ear and out the other,
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:07.000]   and we shrug, think about how offensive that could be.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.960]   And the way I wanna describe it is
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.480]   that what we see in verses two through seven so far,
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.840]   and in this section,
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.160]   is going to be an incredible revelation of God.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.400]   The way I like to put it is,
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.000]   there is a reveal party of God.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.400]   There is a reveal party of God.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.240]   And at this party, it is our job,
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.280]   it is also the respectful thing,
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.880]   it is the appropriate manner and behavior
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.960]   to be all ears, to be all attentive,
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.200]   and be moved by what he's revealing.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.080]   Think about this, if you were at a,
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.360]   nowadays it's really cool to do all kinds of reveal parties,
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.920]   engagement parties,
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.600]   but imagine if you were at this special reveal party
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.360]   of the king, when they're about to have a baby, right?
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.320]   They're about to have a baby
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.240]   and they're gonna reveal the gender.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.840]   They have this kind of pageantry,
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.720]   they have some decorations,
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.160]   they have snacks and desserts and refreshments,
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.480]   and special people are there,
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.200]   special honored guests are there.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.120]   And they're about to call in everybody and say,
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.040]   "Hey, everybody, I know you're just hanging out
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.120]   "with each other now, but come together.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:12.000]   "We're going to have the reveal.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.760]   "What's the gender of the baby?"
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.840]   And they're gonna pop massive balloons
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.440]   and see the powder come out in different colors, right?
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.280]   But imagine if you were so narcissistic
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.240]   and you were saying, "Meh, why am I even here?"
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.080]   Right?
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.200]   And imagine if you just said, "You know, I'm so thirsty.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.520]   "Where's the cooler?
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.760]   "Where are the drinks?
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.520]   "How does that even help me get my drink?"
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.760]   Right?
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.240]   It just shows you your mind is not in the right place.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.720]   Just shows you you're completely out of touch
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.120]   with what's going on.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.040]   But the important part I wanna say is,
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.960]   how rude it would be to the main host of the party.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.400]   How rude it would be to the king.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.880]   How rude it would be for you to sit there
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.560]   and be like, "Oh, what kind of party this,
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.800]   "making everybody stop so we pay attention
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.640]   "to this balloon popping?"
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.120]   That would be very, very rude.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.840]   And so with that said,
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.360]   I wanna move into the next section,
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.000]   which is this, the mystery.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.720]   The mystery.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.960]   Clearly we can tell that the focal point of this passage
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.040]   is the term mystery.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:20.040]   This mystery, aka is the stewardship of God's grace.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.040]   This mystery, aka is an administration.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.400]   This mystery is a plan of God.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.560]   It's his meticulously designed and coordinated event,
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.200]   so to speak,
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.200]   with the revelation of God's plan of redemption
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.440]   for the Gentiles too.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.480]   Think about this.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.520]   There is this mystery being made known,
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.880]   and it's repeated multiple times here.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.440]   Take a look at that slide I have,
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.040]   and it says, "Indeed, you have heard
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.120]   "of the stewardship of God's grace,
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.400]   "which was given to me for you,
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.720]   "that by revelation there has been made known to me
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.160]   "this mystery.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.360]   "As I wrote before in brief by referring to this,
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.400]   "when you heard,"
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.160]   sorry, "when you read, you can understand my insight
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.280]   "into the mystery of Christ."
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.360]   And so we see that, and what's more,
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.960]   we see it in other parts of scripture
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.600]   where Apostle Paul uses this term so many times.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.640]   Why?
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.560]   Because the mystery, he is describing the gospel.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.760]   He is describing the plan of God.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.440]   And so throughout Paul's writing,
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.720]   he mentions that term mystery 20 times.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.880]   In the gospels, it's repeated seven times.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.680]   Now, the tricky thing about this
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.560]   is that in our English language,
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.840]   it is typically translated something like unknown, right?
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.240]   It's a mystery, something you'll just never figure out
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.280]   because it's too hard, right?
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.800]   Like long time ago, there was this funny commercial,
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.400]   where this little boy goes to Mr. Al and says,
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.320]   "Mr. Al, how many licks does it take
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.760]   "to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop?"
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.640]   And then the commercial ends because everybody
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.320]   is so prone to crunch on the lollipop,
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.520]   we'll never find out.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.600]   No one knows, right?
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.240]   That's typically what mystery, people think, means.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.280]   It's an unsolved mystery.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.000]   But that's not what mystery actually refers to.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.840]   Mystery is more so talking about something that is a secret.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.840]   Okay, so more like in tune, a synonym would be secret, right?
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.920]   Essentially, when it was talking about learning a secret
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.080]   or knowledge of a secret, a fact,
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.600]   then that would be a mystery.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.200]   Other passages of Scripture talk about
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.080]   how there is this great mystery
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.000]   that is to be disclosed or manifested.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.120]   So yes, it can be hidden, and that's why we don't know,
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.520]   but that doesn't mean it's some kind of paradox
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.480]   or some kind of anomaly.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.680]   What it means is that it is a truth,
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.840]   such a profound truth.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.880]   It's not just common knowledge.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.800]   It's not just your everyday universal fact,
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.880]   but it's something that God has in His heart.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:49.480]   It's His plan that is to be revealed.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.800]   And so that's the term.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.920]   And if you look at the passage then,
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.360]   and look at all the terms that refer to
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.240]   something that was hidden, concepts of revelation,
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.840]   concepts of revealing something,
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.160]   it's all throughout this passage.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.200]   If indeed you heard the stewardship of God's grace,
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.480]   which was given, okay, it's by revelation.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.520]   It was made known to me, this mystery.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.040]   I wrote it to you.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.760]   You're supposed to read and understand
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.640]   my insight to this mystery.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.120]   And what's more, for generations it was not known,
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.920]   but now it's revealed to the holy apostles and the prophets
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.560]   whose main job is to preach and make known the will of God.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.400]   So all around this passage is talking about
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:33.120]   a knowledge of God that has been made known to us.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:38.640]   Now, what's important for us then is to remember
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.480]   that God in His sovereignty has chosen
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.160]   to hide His truth for certain times.
[00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.720]   And as the time is full according to His own measure,
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.880]   then He is going to reveal.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:56.200]   You and I so live in an incredibly blessed time.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.920]   Seriously.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.560]   And it's not because we live in America.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.880]   It is not because we happen to live in Irvine
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.040]   or Orange County, which happens to be one of the best places
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:13.040]   to live in America, but because we live in a time
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:18.160]   when the word of God is given, Christ's work has been seen.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.120]   And now we can look back into the testimony,
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.720]   both of saints, but the many apostles and prophets
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.320]   that have come before us, and we have God's truth,
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.600]   the light illumined to us.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.160]   That to us is a great, great privilege.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.240]   Think about this.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.680]   There's a passage where Jesus Christ Himself says this,
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.680]   Matthew 11, verse 25,
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.000]   where Jesus says, or passage says in the gospel,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.760]   again, Matthew 11, 25,
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.680]   "At that time, Jesus said, 'I praise you, Father,
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.160]   "Lord of heaven and earth,
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.600]   "that you have hidden these things
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.560]   "from the wise and intelligent,
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.840]   "and have revealed them to infants.'"
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:00.000]   So earlier, I made the challenge,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.840]   if your heart feels a bit hardened,
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.760]   understand that even hearing this truth
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.600]   is an absolute privilege.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.160]   It's an incredible grace of God,
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.520]   which we must be thankful for.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.640]   Now, in order to move forward, let's ask this question.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.600]   This mystery then, yes,
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.400]   it is something that is to be revealed.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.240]   Yes, it is the gospel at large,
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.720]   but is there something more specific
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.360]   that Apostle Paul is talking about?
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.800]   And yes, there is.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.200]   He actually specifies it in verse six.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.760]   What is he saying?
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.360]   The mystery contained specifically in this passage,
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.560]   'cause there are other mysteries
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:32.960]   that the scripture talks about,
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.280]   the mystery of the kingdom,
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.840]   the mystery of the church, yes,
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.680]   the mystery of our resurrection.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.680]   There's other mysteries that are there.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.960]   But here, he says very specifically
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.280]   that the Gentiles are fellow heirs,
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.880]   fellow members of the body,
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.920]   and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.280]   through the gospel, through the gospel.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.120]   And so within this,
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.280]   you have that specific thing that should be bolded.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.120]   You should highlight that and say,
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.040]   I am supposed to really understand this mystery
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.200]   that we, the Gentiles,
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.640]   remember he's saying you Gentiles,
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.920]   so we, the Gentiles,
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.520]   are fellow heirs, fellow members,
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.200]   fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.640]   through the gospel.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.480]   And then he says,
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:16.240]   of which I have been made a minister.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.400]   And so there are two references
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.400]   I'd like to highlight for you.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.080]   One is that through Christ,
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.600]   both Jews and Gentiles have access to God
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.640]   and are being built together to form one church.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.600]   We are fellow members of this body,
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.760]   fellow partakers, okay?
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.400]   And then what's more for Apostle Paul
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.160]   specifically to himself,
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:39.040]   there is this truth that he's going to emphasize,
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.960]   which is that he is a servant to this cause.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.360]   Okay, now thinking about that then,
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.680]   let's focus on the first of the two references there.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.080]   The first, this is an amazing,
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.960]   amazing mystery revealed.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.160]   Amazing mystery revealed.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.600]   Why do we say this?
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.000]   Because to think that the Gentiles are fellow members
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.400]   with the Jewish people
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.480]   was something absurd to the people of the time.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.440]   To think that we have the fellows,
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.440]   that the same, to be in the same body
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.920]   was to the people of the time,
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.880]   especially the Jews, an absurdity.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.040]   And to think that we would receive the promises of God,
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.400]   that would be altogether unjust.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.080]   It would be unfair.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.440]   And so that's why there's this great mystery.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:29.360]   This great mystery of what God is doing in the church
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.960]   is something absolutely profound.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.800]   I wanna highlight something for you,
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.200]   is this, that previously we were told
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.200]   that we are separate from God.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.520]   We have no hope, right?
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.080]   There is no hope for us.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.120]   That relationally we have been so set apart from God
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.600]   to approach him would be absolute death.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.480]   But I want you to think about this.
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.600]   That's all true for the Jew as well.
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.000]   In Exodus, in the book of Exodus,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.120]   when they came to Mount Sinai,
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.800]   God told them, "Bring the people so far
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.920]   "as to come to the bottom of the mountain,
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.040]   "but do not trespass,
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.560]   "otherwise you will immediately die."
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.920]   And so it was.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.360]   People died.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.720]   So when I show you this photo,
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.360]   or this amazing rendition of the picture
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.000]   that I had in my mind,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.880]   understand that this picture is of the Jew.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.560]   Do you know what is a more appropriate picture
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.600]   of the Gentile?
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.320]   Is this next one.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.760]   The Jew was perhaps incrementally
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.320]   a very smidgen closer to God,
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.520]   but that distance between God and man was so far,
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.840]   not a single man or men put together could ever bridge.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.040]   Not ever.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.840]   Across time and space,
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.720]   we've put all the effort of human ingenuity,
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.080]   nobody, nobody by their merit could approach God.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.560]   However, the Jew was just that much bit closer
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.520]   because they had the word with them,
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.840]   because they had the guidance of God with them,
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.640]   because God gave them a covenant.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.560]   But think about this,
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.240]   we who are Gentiles,
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.000]   every single one of us that I know about our church,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.800]   we don't even have that.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.040]   And there exists not only a greater distance,
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.560]   a greater bondage,
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.800]   we are this little, little person over here
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.760]   who has a massive wall between even us and the Jew.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.600]   Why?
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.440]   Because we aren't the chosen nation of Israel.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.320]   As a matter of fact,
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.320]   previously God told the nation of Israel
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.200]   to watch out for people like us,
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.280]   the ethne, the Gentiles,
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.680]   the people out there who worship other gods,
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.440]   who live like God doesn't exist,
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.600]   who has no knowledge or fear of God Almighty.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.360]   God had warned them to stay clear of people like us.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.680]   We're even farther off.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:44.960]   Then to think about this,
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.120]   that Christ has truly then broken the wall,
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.360]   put aside the enmity,
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.600]   enmity, sorry,
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.560]   and that God would cause us to be one,
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:57.760]   this is an incredible, massive truth.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:58.800]   And for us then,
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.960]   we're supposed to appreciate that and say,
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.400]   "Oh my goodness, that is for us."
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.160]   And what's more, it gets even more personal
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.680]   because to this picture then,
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.520]   Apostle Paul is saying,
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.520]   "There is a solution here, which is Christ and the gospel."
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.960]   And he's saying, "I am then to you, your servant in that."
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:15.800]   As a matter of fact,
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.320]   basically what he's saying is,
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.040]   "I'm in prison for you.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.520]   "I'm serving you.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.000]   "I'm serving this cause."
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.240]   And so what we're supposed to do
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.520]   is when we look at this passage,
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.120]   have this great, great sense of appreciation
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.360]   of how that bridge was gapped.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:37.280]   And what's more, what I'll say is this.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.400]   If we think about what that all means then,
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.960]   in the reference to the church, to be specific,
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.600]   the church was supposed to be together, together, together.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.200]   And let me explain that a little bit.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.120]   The church is supposed to be together, together, together.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.480]   Seeing the thought there,
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.280]   when I say that the great mystery
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.680]   was to us supposed to be
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.360]   that the church would be made one by Christ,
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.040]   look at the way, the emphatic way,
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.040]   Apostle Paul describes what the church is supposed to be.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.160]   And the way he describes it is that
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.120]   we were supposed to be fellow heirs,
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.640]   fellow members of the body,
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.920]   and fellow partakers of the promise.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.640]   When we see repetition like that in the scriptures,
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.920]   we're supposed to slow down,
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.440]   take a look, and meditate upon that.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.880]   What I like to say is this is a really interesting
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.760]   kind of, again, another stacking parallel description
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.280]   of what the church is supposed to be.
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:35.920]   Now, for the sake of time,
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.680]   I'm not gonna be able to expound
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.760]   what does it mean to be an heir, right,
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.120]   to receive the inheritance?
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.480]   What does it mean to be one body?
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.360]   What does it mean to be fellow partakers of the promise?
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.920]   We could go on and on about that
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.840]   and look at Old Testament passages
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.280]   that describe those privileges.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.800]   But here and now, let's really focus
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.520]   on the main focal point of the repetition,
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.080]   which is we're supposed to be brought together
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.160]   by one singular person, Jesus Christ,
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.640]   by one singular power, one hope,
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.400]   one spirit, one Father, one God.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.440]   We're supposed to be, through the church,
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.100]   exhibiting that particular truth.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:20.100]   We are so uniquely united, not by anything else.
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.440]   We're supposed to be brought together in such a way
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.020]   where we're supposed to be absolutely one.
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.280]   And the rest of Ephesians is gonna actually describe that
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.560]   in greater detail, too.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.540]   So, let's take a moment to pause and appreciate this.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:40.520]   One, the church mystery is a grand mystery,
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:44.360]   which is a grand reveal party of God.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:49.360]   That, to us, is great news for those of us who are far.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.420]   This gets a bit more personal because,
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.140]   as earlier that I said, Paul says to us
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.460]   that he is a servant to this cause,
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.440]   which essentially means that he is a servant to us.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.300]   Let us not be, let's take a moment to think about this, okay?
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:09.300]   Let us not be those later generations who have it so good.
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.060]   Let us not be the later generations
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.780]   that King Solomon talks about, how it's so vanity
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.800]   because the later generations never really appreciate
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:22.760]   what kind of sacrifice, what kind of servanthood,
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.740]   what kind of kind intention and mercy of God,
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:29.480]   God has exhibited, sending his servants
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.740]   so that we would be here.
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:36.380]   For us, we can't imagine, because yes,
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:40.140]   we do live in, right now, the most powerful country,
[00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:43.420]   a country that many people across the globe
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:48.180]   would literally take the chance of dying to get into.
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.700]   Some would even take the chance
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.020]   of hurting others to get into.
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.380]   Some would risk the lives of their children
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.720]   to get into this country.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:00.620]   And then to act like unappreciative,
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:05.140]   overly privileged individuals, it's ridiculous.
[00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.100]   But likewise here, let us not be those
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.660]   who have it so good that forget
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.500]   what amazing revelation this is,
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:16.080]   what amazing grace of God this is,
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.340]   that God would tell us he is bringing us near
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:21.500]   and giving us all the privilege
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:27.640]   as of those who we had nothing to do with before.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.340]   We had no claim, we had no right,
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:34.540]   we had no part in this, and yet for God to give us that,
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.640]   what an incredible, incredible mercy it is.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.460]   It's so profound.
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.540]   And so by way of conclusion,
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.420]   I ask this interesting question,
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.740]   let's think about Apostle Paul's perspective,
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.900]   and that's going to springboard into next week's study,
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.060]   'cause Apostle Paul's gonna talk about it more,
[00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:54.300]   this administration that he is now a servant of,
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.540]   which also we are servants of.
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:00.260]   However, Apostle Paul, in this passage to me,
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:04.300]   he is absolutely clear about the truth he received
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.340]   and about the truth he's telling.
[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.760]   And for him then, that means,
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.960]   I need to make sure you get it.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:14.880]   But what's also very clear is that Apostle Paul
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.760]   always has such a loving care for the church, right?
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.280]   He's about to say, "I'm praying for you,"
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.240]   and then he's saying, "Do you get it?"
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:29.080]   Apostle Paul has such a love and compassion
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.040]   for the whole Church of God
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.720]   to make sure that the most important thing
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.160]   that the church needs to get
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.920]   is the massive program, the massive intention,
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.920]   the massive redemptive plan that God has for you specifically
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.140]   in the church through Christ, through his blood.
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.320]   And we're supposed to operate
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.400]   underneath that kind of context.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.740]   And so today was not so much lots of didactic
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:59.840]   or specific instruction on this is what you need to do,
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.340]   but it's a moment for you to pause.
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.000]   There's so many things we're supposed to be grateful for
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.040]   at this point, at this juncture,
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.840]   in looking at all that God has done for us,
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.760]   and now thinking of us collectively as a church,
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.680]   bringing us together,
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.560]   our hearts should be overflowing with gratitude.
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:23.000]   My question to you is, do you have an attitude of shrugs?
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.080]   I have heard that before.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.080]   Or is this impacting you?
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.320]   And to ask the follow-up question is,
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.600]   why is it that we're having a hard time hearing that?
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.280]   'Cause we're already in this eight weeks,
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.320]   and I'm guessing you've heard
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.560]   these passages preached before.
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.960]   It is for us to make sure we have our ears,
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.800]   the ears of our heart open,
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.460]   to listen to the great truths of God.
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:47.860]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:54.440]   Heavenly Father, Lord God built into your scripture,
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.400]   you call us to take a moment to evaluate,
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.340]   do I indeed understand?
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.840]   Have I truly heard?
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.840]   And do I see what Apostle Paul is doing?
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.040]   Do I see what the church is trying to do now?
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.960]   And I pray Father God that you would convict in our hearts,
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.300]   Lord, such a gratitude.
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:22.360]   We are the fruit of your great work, your mighty hand.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:26.600]   And on a human level, there have been many before us
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.500]   and many now who are trying to minister to us
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.360]   your gospel truth.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.400]   I pray Father God that we would respond
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.480]   with absolute thankfulness in our hearts.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.160]   And Lord, what's more, I pray that this truth
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.800]   of your salvation,
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.400]   just truth of what you're doing with the church,
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.340]   radically affect where we're placing our priorities,
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:51.280]   would radically affect how we even respond
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.880]   to the things that are happening in our lives.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.540]   And especially during this time, Lord,
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:58.600]   I pray that God, while physically,
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.960]   we're literally forced now,
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:04.640]   and by good measure, Lord, we are having to make sure
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.840]   that we're creating some distance.
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.000]   Help us, Father God, to make sure
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.560]   that we are being spiritually united
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.280]   and that we make every effort to be one,
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.300]   that God, we would be one in thought
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.600]   and that we would be one in heart towards you.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.080]   We love you, it's in Christ, and we pray, amen.
