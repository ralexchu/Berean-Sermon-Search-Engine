[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.300]   (soft music)
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.300]   - Good morning, church family.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:49.140]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.500]   I'm glad all of you made it safely here through the rain.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.580]   As we sing this first song,
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.380]   I wanna just call attention to the song, "We Fall Down."
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.500]   Just a reminder, as we come before our God,
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.540]   this song talks about a posture of humbleness
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.100]   and reverence before our God.
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.780]   Isaiah chapter six, we know when Isaiah is confronted
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.540]   with God and who he is, he falls face down,
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.400]   that we come with an understanding
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.680]   that that's the God who we approach.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.300]   We come with reverence and we come with joy
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.780]   and that desire to honor him.
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.200]   So as we sing this song, I hope and pray
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.040]   that we may be reflective of that.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.000]   (soft music)

[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:34.340]   Oh
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:52.620]   Good morning and welcome to bring community church
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:15:00.820]   Let me just jump into our announcements first of all as you guys know our Bible study weekday Bible study in Galatians
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.140]   Inductive Bible study is starting again
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:10.040]   At the end of the month in August 30th if you've never attended our Bible lab
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.760]   Which is gonna be happening on September
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.440]   August 27 through September 10th, which is three Sundays
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.020]   I think starting from next Sunday and then three Sundays from two to three
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:28.820]   Basically, this Bible lab is to help you do the inductive Bible study, which is what we're doing in home groups in small groups
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.900]   So if you've been in the Bible study and you had a hard time, you know
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:37.640]   You don't quite understand what's going on or you having a difficult time doing the inductive Bible study
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.420]   This class was created to help you along
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.300]   So and if you've never attended before and you're new to the church
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:48.260]   I strongly strongly recommend that you take you take this class because it'll help you to
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.360]   Jump into the Bible studies that we're in
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:57.140]   so our inductive Bible study basically is we have a text in Galatians or whatever text that we're in and we ask you to go
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:00.200]   Home and really dissect the text and come prepared
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:06.940]   So that when you come to the groups you're there to share not just to have the pastor prepare the message and then just give
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.920]   You like this is what it just means is we're asking you to come prepared for to do that
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:16.880]   So if you're not used to do an inductive Bible study, and maybe you've never even heard the term before this Bible
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.740]   Lab is for that purpose
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:23.020]   So pastor mark is leading this class from 2 to 3 for 3 Sundays
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:28.260]   And we do this each time before we start the Bible studies and so to kind of help you along
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:36.460]   So again, even if you've taken it before and you need a refresher, he'll go through the text the word study, you know context outline and
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:42.900]   Good questions to ask and this will definitely help you to jump in to be able to get the most out of the Bible study
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:47.140]   So again, the regular Bible study is starting in not this week
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:52.160]   But the week after that and then the Bible lab is also going to be happening starting from next Sunday
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:58.940]   Okay, men's ministry. We have a quarters men's ministry that's happening on September 9th at 9 a.m. This is a Saturday morning
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:05.020]   I'll be going over what it means to be accountable. So men especially for men
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.540]   Accountability and that's the subject that we're going to be covering
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:12.960]   So we have like breakfast that we're gonna be eating at 9 and then we have lunch fellowship
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.260]   So it's a good time for the brothers to get together
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:19.980]   Share a meal get to know other guys that the people that we're running with
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.300]   So if you haven't signed up for it, I will strongly recommend you sign up
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:30.140]   The cost for the meal is going to be $10. And again, we're going to be having light light breakfast and then a lunch afterwards
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:35.440]   One last thing a family ministry community groups are starting again in the fall
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:40.620]   And so it's gonna be starting on September 10th, October 8th, November 5th. So three times
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.620]   so if you're a part of the family ministry and
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:47.620]   You want to meet other people and fellowship with them if you sign up for this?
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:52.320]   They'll put you into small groups. And then the whole purpose of this is so that you can fellowship and get to know the other
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:58.800]   People who are coming into the church people who are in the church. And so it's an opportunity to to fellowship together
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.300]   So all of these things you can find on our church app
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:08.780]   So if you don't have the app, I strongly recommend you download the app if not on our it's not on our Facebook page
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.740]   But it is on our church website somewhere I think okay
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.800]   So if you go looking for it again, the best place to do this in the app
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.520]   So I so look for that and that's where the signups would be
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:24.980]   If you have a hard time finding any of this go to our newcomers table and they'll help you out with that. Okay?
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.380]   All right. I think that's it for the announcements
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:33.200]   Let me pray for us and give you a minute to give your offering and then after our worship time
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:38.440]   Our sister Kim Ramos is gonna come and give our testimony be baptized this morning
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:43.980]   So again, if you have a physical offering again, there's a box out there as you're going you'll see to your right. Okay, let's pray
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:50.380]   Father we thank you for your blessing. We thank you for
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:55.520]   All the things that you are doing that we are aware of the things that you do behind the scene
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.960]   To make all things work together for good
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.280]   Help us Lord as we have gathered together to corporately worship you
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.940]   That we would not simply put in our time
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:11.060]   But that you would stir in our hearts a reminder of what it is that we have in you
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:17.420]   So that our worship may truly be an overflow of the tremendous grace and work that you have given us
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.980]   May this time be a blessing to our congregation to you
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:29.280]   May your name be exalted that even in this giving help us to give with a cheerful heart and may it be multiplied
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:35.020]   3030 60 a hundredfold for the purpose of your kingdom in Jesus name. We pray. Amen

[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:08.660]   Emmanuel be sated.
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:20.660]   Good morning, Church.
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.660]   My name is Kim, and I'll be sharing my testimony with you all today.
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.660]   (silence)
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:35.660]   It was challenging to grasp the concept of familial love while I was growing up.
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:41.660]   At the age of five, I witnessed my father leave us after years of struggle in a failing marriage.
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:45.660]   He left a home filled with broken people.
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.660]   A broken wife, broken sons, and a broken daughter.
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:54.660]   Like a damaged pot, cracks will only grow bigger and deeper with time.
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:58.660]   And surely enough, as I grew older and the cracks grew bigger,
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:03.660]   I was sure that happiness was never going to be an option unless I created it for myself.
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.660]   (silence)
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:14.660]   Being emotionally, physically, and sexually abused show me how sinful people can truly be.
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:20.660]   As I was raised in this environment, I concluded that I could have the same type of power they hold over me
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.660]   if I also participated in the same sin.
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:28.660]   People I had allowed in my life had only served as a means of survival.
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:32.660]   Friendships and relationships were solely transactional.
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:36.660]   I became a faceless, hollow shell masquerading in many masks.
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:42.660]   Eventually, perfection was no longer a beneficial result of my accomplishments.
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.660]   It was the only exception in my life.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:49.660]   How I dressed, walked, talked, the accolades I collected,
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:54.660]   I had to be impressive and spotless and perfect in every single way.
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:30:01.660]   I was completely blinded by my greed, pride, callousness, arrogance, fear, shame,
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:05.660]   and a deep sadness that resulted in clinging onto the world even more.
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:11.660]   After graduating high school, I sunk even deeper into my own depravity.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.660]   While I postured myself as a perfect person,
[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:20.660]   I covered up my depression and filled the most empty parts of myself through substance abuse.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:24.660]   At this point in my life, I wanted power, control.
[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:29.660]   Yet it was my own fleshly desires that controlled me instead.
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:33.660]   I was bitter, angry, hopeless, and lonely.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:39.660]   Quick fixes through my addiction and risky behavior was what kept me going.
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:44.660]   I didn't have a father to guide me growing up,
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:49.660]   so I clung onto unhealthy relationships and sought validation from men.
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:55.660]   At this point in my life, I figured if people could so easily use me and abuse me,
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.660]   then there is no reason for me to care.
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:03.660]   While I was struggling with doubts of throwing my life away,
[00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.660]   my brother became more active in attending church again.
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:14.660]   As he continued to grow, he started to consistently invite me to Bible studies held at his church.
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:20.660]   At first, I took his persistence as pestering, but I was curious.
[00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:26.660]   I witnessed his heart change so much, and our relationship had improved so well.
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:30.660]   And it led me to wonder what had been working through his heart.
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.660]   Eventually, I started going to Bible study.
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:40.660]   And while I was still worldly, it sparked a curiosity to know more about the Lord.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:44.660]   One day, I went to a party, and while everyone else was drinking and partying,
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:48.660]   I saw a guy playing guitar by himself, not participating in anything.
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:52.660]   Intrigued, I approached him, and he was playing the only Christian song I knew at the time,
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.660]   "Oceans" by Hillsong.
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:58.660]   Ironically, we started having a conversation about faith at that party.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:04.660]   He then invited me to his church's communion night, a Q&A that their church holds once a month.
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:09.660]   There, I asked the pastor a lot of questions, and while I approached him with aggression
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:13.660]   and my own worldly sense of justice, he chose to answer with truth
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:18.660]   and met me with so much patience, love, and care.
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:24.660]   It was after that instance with that pastor that my desire to chase the Lord grew.
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:28.660]   I started attending a different church after that for a couple of years,
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:34.660]   and though I thought it to be with good intentions, my walk toward Christianity was imperfect.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:39.660]   I eventually became a professing Christian, but I still sought validation from the world.
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:43.660]   Christ was not my center.
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:48.660]   I seek validation and comfort from Christian people, but not from Christ.
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:52.660]   After facing challenging circumstances and growing doubts about the theology I was learning
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:58.660]   at a previous church, I started to question the validity of my own faith and home.
[00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:06.660]   But in my distress, I continued to pursue the truth fervently.
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:13.660]   While I cannot pinpoint the specific moment I knew I was saved, I do remember one day last year,
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:18.660]   laying in bed in prayer, in my loneliness and in my tears,
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:22.660]   feeling the weight of God's sovereignty over my life,
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:30.660]   the awareness of my own fleshly wretchedness, and how unworthy I truly was to be in his mercy.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:35.660]   Second Corinthians 12:10 states, "Therefore I am well content with my weaknesses,
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:41.660]   with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ's sake,
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:46.660]   for when I am weak, then I am strong."
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:51.660]   Even in my weaknesses and at my lowest, through his grace, God has given me strength,
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:56.660]   even though I knew fully well that I am not deserving.
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:02.660]   Hebrews 4:16 states, "Therefore let us draw near in confidence to the throne of grace,
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:08.660]   so that we may receive mercy and find grace and help in time of need."
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:13.660]   I now rejoice in my past hurts and in my present pain,
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:16.660]   but it is through my struggle that I am drawn most closest to him,
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:22.660]   and through his grace I am able to overcome.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:28.660]   I choose now to stand here before you all, to be baptized in front of the congregation,
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:32.660]   in order to proclaim my devotion to our Father.
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:37.660]   My body is no longer my body, but through unity with Christ's death,
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:41.660]   my body now belongs within the body of Christ.
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:47.660]   Even though my worldly father left me, my Father in Heaven was always with me,
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:54.660]   imperfect just as I am, yet he still chooses to love me so deeply.
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.660]   Thank you.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:08.660]   [applause]
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:19.660]   [water pouring]
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.660]   Kim, do you understand when you go into the water, you're being united to Christ's death,
[00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:25.660]   and then when you come out, you're being united to his resurrected life?
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:26.660]   I do.
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:30.660]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:35.660]   [water pouring]
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:47.660]   [applause]
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.660]   All right, thank you, Kim, for that powerful testimony.
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:53.660]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke 6.
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:36:07.660]   Again, we are continuing our series in the choosing of the 12 disciples.
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:11.660]   We are going to be, again, in the same text, but let me just pray for us,
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:15.660]   and we'll jump into the message this morning.
[00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:21.660]   Heavenly Father, we ask for your blessing over this time.
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:27.660]   We know, Father God, that there is a world of difference of just studying the Bible,
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:34.660]   understanding the text and the context, than when you illuminate our hearts,
[00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.660]   you open our ears and soften our hearts.
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:42.660]   Lord, we want to know more than just information.
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.660]   We want to understand your heart.
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.660]   We want to know you.
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:54.660]   We pray that your word would be a means for us to come and draw closer to you.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.660]   We pray for your blessing.
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.660]   We pray for your spirit's guidance.
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.660]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:04.660]   As you guys know, we just came back from our retreat,
[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:09.660]   and every time that we have our all-church retreat, the debate is,
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.660]   are we going to do this again?
[00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:14.660]   And I know for a lot of people, I mean, for myself included,
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:21.660]   it's a huge blessing for me because not only am I enjoying the retreat and the teaching,
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.660]   but at the retreat you get to meet a lot of people,
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.660]   spend time with people that I've known for many years
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:29.660]   but haven't had fellowship with for a while,
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:33.660]   or met a bunch of new people that some of you have been here for a while
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.660]   and I've never had any contact,
[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:38.660]   so the retreat was an opportunity to kind of fellowship and get to know you better.
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:42.660]   And hopefully that that will overflow into the life of the church as well,
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:46.660]   the people that you've met that hopefully the church feels a little bit smaller to you
[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.660]   after you come back from the retreat.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.660]   But every time we come back from a large retreat like that,
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:55.660]   people say, "800-some people went up to a retreat. Your church is crazy.
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.660]   Is that possible?"
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.660]   You know, like logistics.
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.660]   And yes, and everybody who was involved, they worked so hard,
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:05.660]   and every time it's like, "Okay, this is going to be it.
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.660]   This is the last one."
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:13.660]   Because so much energy, time goes into prepping and running and doing all of this stuff,
[00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.660]   especially the children's department.
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:19.660]   Last time we went up two years ago, I think we had about 100 kids,
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.660]   and this time we had over 200.
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:26.660]   So just in two years, the number of children just grew exponentially.
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:29.660]   So I cannot guarantee that we're not going to do this again,
[00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:34.660]   but again, every time we do that, the reason why that debate is
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.660]   because it is so hard to run things with the number of people.
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:40.660]   Can you imagine? I can't imagine.
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:45.660]   This is just 800 people, but some of you guys have been to conferences
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:48.660]   where there's thousands of people.
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.660]   I've been to large conferences where there's over 10,000 people.
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:55.660]   I've been to mission conferences where they had 20,000, 30,000 people.
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:59.660]   So I can't imagine the work that goes into the gathering of these things.
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:05.660]   So now, I mean, with the Internet and the advertisements, and I get emails all the time.
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:08.660]   It's like, "Hey, there's this new conference coming in our denomination.
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.660]   There's a pastor's conference. There's a leader's conference.
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:13.660]   There's a mission's conference."
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:17.660]   And some of them are small, just local, maybe gathering of maybe a couple hundred people,
[00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.660]   and then some of them are gigantic.
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:22.660]   We had thousands and thousands of people coming from all over the world.
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:28.660]   Whenever I receive these advertisements, the first thing that I look at is who is coming.
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.660]   Who are the guest speakers?
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:32.660]   Who are the keynote speakers that they've gathered together?
[00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:35.660]   And so immediately, you'll recognize.
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:39.660]   At least somebody in this group is like, "Oh, okay, these guys are coming."
[00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:44.660]   It's a huge conference, so they got big names to come and speak and encourage the group.
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:47.660]   But every once in a while, you'll have a conference,
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.660]   and I don't recognize a single person in this chart.
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:53.660]   They have like 15 names, and I don't know a single person.
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:58.660]   Immediately, I was like, "Okay, this probably is not for me because I don't recognize who they are."
[00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:05.660]   If you're going to put that kind of money and energy and time into putting an event that's that big together,
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:13.660]   one of the first things that you think of is who are we going to come and address this group?
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:18.660]   Now, the reason why I start my message with this is because,
[00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:25.660]   can you imagine people who are coming to Jesus that they're asking,
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.660]   "Who are his disciples?"
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:30.660]   And you don't recognize a single person?
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:35.660]   That this is the greatest event that has taken place in Israel's history.
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:39.660]   This could be the Messiah that they've been waiting for for hundreds of years,
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:43.660]   and then they're going down the list of who he chose as his disciples,
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:47.660]   and there's not a single person of significance.
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.660]   There's no scholar among this group.
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:50.660]   There's no Pharisee.
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:52.660]   There's nobody working at the temple.
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:55.660]   There's no filthy rich person.
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:56.660]   There's no aristocrat.
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.660]   Not a single person.
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:03.660]   The majority of them were just common blue-collar workers, fishermen,
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:07.660]   and you had a zealot in there, and we have some people that we pretty much, you know,
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:13.660]   as we're going down the line, the next few groups of people we know almost nothing about.
[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:18.660]   It's like, why would they gather these people for the greatest thing?
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.660]   I mean, can you imagine, this is the greatest thing,
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:25.660]   greatest event that happened in Israel's history,
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:28.660]   and the people that Jesus surrounded himself with,
[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:32.660]   there's not a single person that was recognized.
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:36.660]   In fact, out of all the people that Jesus gathered around him,
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.660]   the most controversial was Matthew.
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:44.660]   Now, we know that in retrospect, now that we have the knowledge of what Judas did,
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.660]   it was a betrayer, and we'll talk about him at the end,
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:51.660]   but at this point, when Jesus is collecting his disciples,
[00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:54.660]   the most controversial person was Matthew.
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:42:00.660]   In fact, the choosing of Matthew himself, many people would have just disqualified Jesus,
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:04.660]   saying, "How can he be the Messiah and have Matthew as his disciple?
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.660]   That makes no sense.
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:08.660]   How can he be the Messiah?"
[00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:13.660]   You have to understand just how controversial this decision was to choose Matthew.
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:16.660]   In order to understand why they hated Matthew,
[00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.660]   you have to understand that at this particular period of time,
[00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:23.660]   the Romans have spread their kingdom so vast and wide
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:27.660]   that they had a very difficult time controlling rebellions that may break out.
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:31.660]   And so one of the key things that they did was they put puppet kings.
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.660]   In Israel, they put the Herodian dynasty.
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:37.660]   They weren't even Jews. They were Idrumeans.
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.660]   Basically to control the population of Israel.
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:44.660]   So they were more loyal to the pagan nation Romans than they were to Israel.
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:48.660]   That's why the Israelites resented the Herods.
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.660]   They gave some religious freedom.
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:53.660]   So just so that you can think that you have some religious freedom,
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:58.660]   as long as you acknowledge Caesar as the ultimate king.
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:01.660]   So they would establish statues of Caesar,
[00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:03.660]   whatever temple that people would be going to,
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:06.660]   and bow down and acknowledge Caesar before you go into the temple.
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:10.660]   But of all the things that Rome did in order to control
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:14.660]   and to subjugate the nations that they conquered,
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:18.660]   where the people felt the most tangible place
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:22.660]   where the rubber met the road was with the taxation.
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:26.660]   The way that Rome, because of all the roads and many things that they were doing,
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:29.660]   they had to collect enough money to do that.
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:33.660]   And they knew that if they sent Roman soldiers knocking at the doors,
[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:36.660]   that it would incite bitterness and anger toward Rome.
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:40.660]   So they had an idea that they were going to recruit from their own countrymen.
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:46.660]   And they would sell like a franchise that whoever bid the highest money,
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:50.660]   that they would give it to them and they would have the rights to go and collect taxes.
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:55.660]   So the people that they would be angry with, would be with their own countrymen.
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:59.660]   So you can see how this would become a huge problem
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:01.660]   for anybody who took this position.
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.660]   That you literally had to sell out your nation.
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:07.660]   But in particular, we're talking about Matthew.
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:12.660]   The way that the Romans collected taxes was they had what was a fixed tax,
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:15.660]   which was real estate and also a poll tax.
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:20.660]   Whoever was born, that they would every once in a while go back to your hometown,
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:24.660]   they would do a head count and based upon how many members are in your family,
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:27.660]   they would have a flat tax for the people who are in your family
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:29.660]   and they would have a flat tax for your property.
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.660]   Those are the fixed tax, so you can't mess with that.
[00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:36.660]   So you owe that every once in a while and you have to pay it, right?
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.660]   And then you had the duty tax.
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:41.660]   The duty tax is where we ran into problems
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:47.660]   because people who collected the duty tax basically created taxes wherever they were at.
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:51.660]   So they would tax the road, they would tax the cart that you were on.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:54.660]   If you were a fisherman, they would tax the fish.
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:59.660]   And then they would tax when you sold something, there would be a separate sales tax.
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:02.660]   Basically, they could create whatever tax that they wanted to collect.
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.660]   So the way that the Rome would make money was Rome would say,
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.660]   "We need this much tax collected,"
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:11.660]   and then the tax collectors would come and get that amount
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:16.660]   and then whatever extra that they collected would be their own money, right?
[00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:19.660]   So you can see why somebody would want that position
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.660]   because it was the easiest way to become wealthy.
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:26.660]   But they literally had to sell out their country to do that.
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.660]   That was Matthew.
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:33.660]   Matthew was somebody who was universally hated by every Jew.
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:40.660]   In fact, the worst group to put together would have been the fishermen and this tax collector
[00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:47.660]   because Matthew was from the same region that Peter and the other disciples came from,
[00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:51.660]   which means that Matthew was the one who knocked on the door.
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:54.660]   Matthew was the one, if they had a great catch and brought it in,
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:46:00.660]   he would have been the one standing there waiting as they're counting the fish.
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:02.660]   He would have been the one.
[00:46:02.660 --> 00:46:07.660]   You know, every time we have a retreat or we have small groups,
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:12.660]   we spend hours wrestling over the small groups, right?
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:15.660]   And those are guys who went to the retreat and especially the singles.
[00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:17.660]   You guys shared four per room.
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:20.660]   And every time we make those rooms, sometimes you ask, which is easy,
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:24.660]   and then those of you who don't ask, we have to sit there like, oh, are they going to fit together?
[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:27.660]   Is this person going to feel left out?
[00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.660]   Do they have some drama in the past and we can't put them together?
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:34.660]   So we have to think through all of these things to make sure that we're putting people in the right place.
[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:41.660]   And that's just a small group of any four or even Bible study of six or seven.
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:46.660]   I mean, you're gathering 12 people and seven of them,
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:53.660]   or they have a history of having their money embezzled by one of them,
[00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:58.660]   and he chooses to put them together and travel together for three years.
[00:46:58.660 --> 00:46:59.660]   And these were the guys.
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:04.660]   I think most of us would have predicted this is not going to work out.
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:09.660]   Matthew is going to die, basically, when Jesus goes up to sleep and then goes to pray.
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:13.660]   And by the time he comes back, they're going to have 11 disciples.
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:19.660]   You wouldn't predict that because that's kind of hatred that they had toward Matthew.
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:23.660]   The question that we ask is why was he chosen among them?
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.660]   We understand that he didn't choose the aristocrats.
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:31.660]   He didn't choose the big names or the wealthy people or have a good track record.
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:35.660]   OK, we understand. He chose plain people.
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:39.660]   But to have somebody that was literally taking their money,
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:44.660]   you have to understand that this wasn't simply just taken from wealthy people.
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:48.660]   You know, some of these guys are just wrestling to pay their bills,
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:51.660]   and you see a tax collector coming knocking on their door.
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:54.660]   They say, "Hey, you know, you're giving milk. Where'd you get that milk?"
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.660]   And he could tax that, right?
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:01.660]   If a mother's carrying the baby to go to the hospital or wherever they're going to give birth
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:07.660]   or to get medical attention, they can tax that, the fact that you're on their road.
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:12.660]   So this guy was considered the worst of sinners.
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:19.660]   In fact, a tax collector is often equated either the worst of sinners or tax collector or a what?
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:22.660]   A prostitute.
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:26.660]   And they were used simultaneously as the worst of the worst of the worst.
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:33.660]   And that's how the nation viewed them, but even more practically, the disciples.
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:36.660]   This was not just a traitor for our nation.
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.660]   This was a guy who was taking our money, our milk money.
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.660]   This was the bully.
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:43.660]   And because they were going around taking money that people didn't want to give,
[00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:46.660]   they had to hire local thugs.
[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:52.660]   They needed strong men to be able to go around and force people to pay the money.
[00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:57.660]   So this guy, again, I mean, I'm not exaggerating.
[00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:01.660]   This is how much they hated this guy.
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:04.660]   So why was he chosen?
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:08.660]   This morning, I want to give you two things that are pretty obvious in this text.
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:17.660]   One, Matthew was chosen deliberately for the purpose of challenging the religious system of that time.
[00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:22.660]   Remember when John the Baptist, when he came out to baptize and he was preparing for the way of Christ,
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.660]   he came out of Jerusalem.
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:29.660]   So anybody who wanted to hear from him, that clearly he's a prophet.
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:31.660]   For hundreds of years, nobody has come.
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:35.660]   Everybody is saying that this guy is speaking for God, but he's not speaking at the temple.
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:37.660]   He goes way out.
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.660]   So even the Pharisees were curious, what's going on?
[00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:41.660]   Is he truly a prophet?
[00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:46.660]   They had to leave the epicenter of Judaism to go out to listen to him.
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:51.660]   And then when Jesus comes, he takes it to the next level.
[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:56.660]   Everything about his choice was to challenge the religious system.
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.660]   He wasn't simply coming and saying, "Hey, you guys need some reform."
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:03.660]   The way you're running the temple, collecting money, making disciples, how you're worshiping God,
[00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:09.660]   what you think is right, you know, we're going to have to do some tweaking and bring some revival into the system.
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:13.660]   He actually challenged the whole system itself.
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:18.660]   The whole system had to be torn down and he needed to start over.
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:21.660]   And that's what the choosing of Matthew was.
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:26.660]   Remember in Romans 12, 2-3, those of you guys who remember the study of the Book of Romans,
[00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:34.660]   Romans is a challenge against the Jews because they had such a hard time opening up the kingdom of God to the Gentiles.
[00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:40.660]   So the whole Book of Romans is challenging the religious system of the Jews.
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:47.660]   That the kingdom of God is not just for the Jews, but that God has opened the door for the Gentiles as well.
[00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:53.660]   So Romans 12, verse 2 says, "Do not be conformed to this world,
[00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:58.660]   but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you may prove what the will of God is."
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:05.660]   In other words, the Jews were having a hard time thinking of what they thought righteousness was.
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:10.660]   And he said, "Your whole understanding, your whole paradigm has to change.
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:14.660]   You have to understand the will of God, that which is good and acceptable and perfect."
[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:18.660]   And then he says, verse 3, "For through the grace given to me, I say to everyone among you,
[00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:21.660]   not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think."
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:27.660]   He's challenging the religious system because the Jews thought that they were ahead of the game of the Gentiles.
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:33.660]   Those are sinners. Moses is our father. Abraham is our father.
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.660]   So we're a little bit ahead of the game.
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:42.660]   And so the whole letter of Romans is to challenge that thinking, "No, all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:44.660]   Those who are under the law will be judged under the law.
[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:46.660]   Those who are without the law will be judged without the law.
[00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:50.660]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:59.660]   So he's saying, "Your whole paradigm of how you understand your righteousness has to change."
[00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:07.660]   The choice of Matthew would have completely challenged what they thought righteousness was.
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:12.660]   Because they thought if the Messiah came, he would choose one of the Pharisees.
[00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:15.660]   Pharisees were the ones who were keeping the law.
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:17.660]   They were the ones who were teaching other people.
[00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:22.660]   They were the ones who made sure that everybody followed the law.
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:24.660]   And none of them were chosen.
[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:34.660]   Not only were they not chosen, this worst of sinners, the tax collector, he was chosen to be one of his disciples.
[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:46.660]   See, that's why the Scriptures tell us the first thing that a Christian must do before he can add anything or do anything is he must die.
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:49.660]   The Bible says if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:52.660]   The old has gone, behold the new has come.
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:54.660]   The old has to die.
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:53:05.660]   Because if you retain your paradigm of what you had before you met Christ, everything you learn you put into that same bucket.
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:11.660]   If you are a materialist, which is the whole world wrestles with this,
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:18.660]   a materialist is somebody who sees blessings through the eyes of material things.
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:21.660]   So, we talk about the health and wealth gospel people.
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:23.660]   They're materialists.
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:31.660]   So whenever they hear the gospel, the good news is that if you are faithful to God, if you are righteous, God is going to bless you.
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:33.660]   And you're going to be healthy.
[00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:35.660]   You're going to become wealthy.
[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:37.660]   And you're going to live, again, a long life.
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:42.660]   Because they're hearing the gospel through the lens of a materialist.
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:47.660]   But we don't have to go to Joel Osteen's church to hear the false gospel.
[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:54.660]   Because you can be here hearing the same gospel, but if you have the same paradigm as a materialist,
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:54:01.660]   you thank God, "Oh, thank you for the grace that you've given me because I didn't have a job and now I have a job."
[00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:07.660]   "Thank you for the blessing that you've given me. I was sick and I prayed and then you made me well."
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:18.660]   "Thank you for being kind to me because I did my best to be faithful and I prayed and then you answered my prayer and I'm able to have a better retirement."
[00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:25.660]   You don't have to go to a false gospel teaching church to be a materialist.
[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:31.660]   If we're not careful, we hear everything through the lens of a materialist.
[00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:33.660]   If we're not careful.
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:38.660]   We're thankful when things are going good, just like the eyes of the world.
[00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:45.660]   And when things aren't going good, it's like, "Oh, what did I do wrong? Maybe I didn't pray enough. Maybe I didn't do this enough."
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.660]   And that's because the old self has not died.
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:51.660]   The old religious system still lives in us.
[00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:54.660]   That everything that we hear goes into that bucket.
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:59.660]   If you're an atheist, you hear the gospel and you say, "Oh, these are a lot of good teachings."
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:02.660]   "Do unto others as you desire to do unto them, the golden rule."
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:03.660]   Right?
[00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:06.660]   And so you hear everything as an opportunity.
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:08.660]   It's like, "Oh, he was a good man who set a good example."
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:12.660]   "You want to learn good morals, the church or religion is the place to go."
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:17.660]   If you're a theist, you hear that and say, "Oh, religion is good for society."
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:21.660]   "It has a sanctifying effect on people."
[00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:25.660]   So religion is good, whether you're a Buddhist, whether you're a Muslim, whether you're a Christian.
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:27.660]   As long as you believe, right?
[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:29.660]   You're a man of faith.
[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:30.660]   And that's a theist.
[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:34.660]   A humanist will hear the gospel through the lens of how does it affect man.
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:38.660]   So everything you hear the gospel is, "Oh, God loves us unconditionally."
[00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:42.660]   "There's nothing you can do. God loves you no matter what."
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:47.660]   And so the worst sin that you can commit is have somebody offended in the church.
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:51.660]   The worst sin that you can do is somebody come in and say, "I was discouraged."
[00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:53.660]   "Oh, we got to change that."
[00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:56.660]   Because that's a humanist mentality.
[00:55:56.660 --> 00:56:02.660]   A legalist is somebody who hears the gospel and the first thing that they run to, "Okay, now what do I do?"
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:03.660]   Right?
[00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.660]   "What do I do? What do I do to become better?"
[00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:07.660]   "What do I do to become more disciplined?"
[00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:14.660]   "What do I do so that I can earn my way and be discipled into the next level?"
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:22.660]   The Pharisees saw their whole religion as a system of do's and don'ts that they need to climb up this ladder.
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:28.660]   And in this ladder, the Pharisees were on the top and the tax collectors were on the bottom.
[00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:38.660]   So the fact that Jesus asked tax collector to be one of his disciples, they just couldn't fathom.
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:43.660]   Because it challenged their whole religious outlook.
[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:48.660]   Just kind of like if you're a materialist and you're coming to praise God and you become a Christian
[00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:51.660]   and all of a sudden you get sick.
[00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:53.660]   All of a sudden you lose your job.
[00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:58.660]   All of a sudden you experience foreclosure or bankruptcy.
[00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:01.660]   It's like, "What?"
[00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:04.660]   "I followed you. I became a Christian. What happened?"
[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:10.660]   And it completely destroys your paradigm of what you understand as a blessing from God.
[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:19.660]   Jesus chose Matthew because it completely challenged the fundamental core of what they believed was right and wrong.
[00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:27.660]   I mean, I can go on and on about the response that the Pharisees and the scribes gave in Luke 5.30.
[00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:30.660]   It says, "The Pharisees and the scribes began grumbling in their disciples, saying,
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:35.660]   'Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?'"
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:40.660]   Luke 15.1-2, "Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were coming near him to listen to him.
[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:46.660]   Both the Pharisees and the scribes began grumbling, saying, 'This man receives sinners and eats with them.'"
[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:52.660]   I mean, they were bothered and triggered just the fact that Jesus was hanging around them.
[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:58.660]   Jesus just went to their house and they're like, "What kind of a Messiah, what kind of a man of God is that?"
[00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:03.660]   So can you imagine if it triggered them for Jesus to be eating with them?
[00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:10.660]   Can you imagine how it must have triggered them that Jesus chose one of them to be his disciple?
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:13.660]   How much they were stirred, how angry they were.
[00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:18.660]   That in and of itself, like he's disqualified.
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:21.660]   Because he doesn't fit. It wasn't just the fact that he didn't go and conquer Rome.
[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:27.660]   Even his choosing of the disciples disqualifies him because he went against everything that they thought.
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:30.660]   That's why they kept on asking, "How come they don't keep the Sabbath?
[00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:33.660]   How come your disciples don't fast?"
[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:36.660]   Because that fit into their religious system.
[00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:44.660]   In fact, they hated the tax collectors so much that by their law, the tax collectors were banned from the synagogue and the temple.
[00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:47.660]   They weren't allowed to come in.
[00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:58.660]   In fact, in their Talmud, in their law system, they actually said, "It is righteous to lie and cheat a tax collector."
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:00.660]   Because that's what he does for a living.
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:05.660]   Since he does that for a living, it's only right that we treat him the way he deserves.
[00:59:05.660 --> 00:59:09.660]   So by their law, tax collectors, you can lie to them. You can cheat them.
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:13.660]   Again, can you imagine how much this must have triggered?
[00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:17.660]   In fact, not only does he choose them as his disciples, as they kept on challenging Jesus,
[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:21.660]   in Matthew 21, 31, Jesus turns the table around and says,
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:31.660]   "Jesus said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, that the tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the kingdom of God before you.'"
[00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:40.660]   So if they were angered that Jesus was eating with them, hanging out with them, and then even choosing them as his disciples,
[00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:43.660]   can you imagine how much this would have angered them?
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:49.660]   Not only are you wrong about all of this stuff, but they're actually more righteous than you.
[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:52.660]   They're going to enter the kingdom before you.
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:58.660]   These were the guys who dedicated themselves to be religious pure.
[00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:01.660]   They kept the law meticulously.
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:07.660]   They were the ones who tithed even the minute details of their income.
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:11.660]   I mean, on the surface, they did everything righteous, and then can you imagine Jesus saying,
[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:17.660]   "No, the tax collector, who's a traitor to the country, who's embezzling people, taking money from poor families,
[01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:21.660]   he will enter the kingdom before you."
[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:25.660]   So imagine how paradigm shifting this is.
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:29.660]   In 1 Corinthians 1.18, it says, "The word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing,
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:33.660]   but to those who are being saved, it is the power of God."
[01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:40.660]   So we can understand how, if you're not a Christian, you don't understand the gospel, why this would be so offensive.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:42.660]   That's just utter foolishness.
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:49.660]   Why would somebody who dedicated his life to embezzle other people get in the front line?
[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:55.660]   And why would the people who were religious leaders who dedicated their lives to study the Torah
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:01:00.660]   and then to disciple other people be in the back of the line?
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:12.660]   Everything that was doing it was to challenge the core of what they believed to be right and wrong.
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:18.660]   But the reason why he needed to do that was not simply to slap them and say, "Hey, your whole system is wrong."
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:23.660]   The reason why he did that was because they needed to first die.
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:29.660]   Their whole paradigm needs to be shifted in order for the gospel to come in.
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:33.660]   Because the gospel is not going to make any sense to a Pharisee.
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:39.660]   The gospel message, the whole reason why Jesus came, isn't going to make any sense to a Pharisee
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:44.660]   who his whole system of righteousness is, "We're going to keep the law. We're going to be good enough.
[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:46.660]   We're going to climb this ladder."
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:52.660]   And then all of a sudden Jesus comes and says, "Your righteousness is based on faith, not by your works."
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:57.660]   So he needed to make sure that they understood that I didn't come to bolster up your system.
[01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:05.660]   I came to challenge your system and then to highlight the new gospel, the good news.
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:09.660]   In fact, 1 Timothy 1, 15-16, it says,
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:15.660]   "It is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:21.660]   Among whom I am foremost of all, yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me, as the foremost,
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:29.660]   Jesus Christ might demonstrate his perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in him for eternal life."
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:31.660]   We look at Apostle Paul, right?
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:34.660]   If we were to choose, right?
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:38.660]   If we were to choose based upon human ability,
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:41.660]   Apostle Paul would have been at the top of that list, right?
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:44.660]   So you say, "Why didn't he choose Paul to begin with?
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:48.660]   Why the disciples and, you know, like the tax collector?
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:50.660]   They should have chose Paul to begin with.
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:52.660]   He's a Roman citizen.
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:54.660]   He's one of the top scholars of Israel.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:57.660]   He already has a prominence, right?
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:59.660]   And he has zeal, Pharisees.
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:01.660]   That's the law, it was perfect.
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:09.660]   So that guy fit every quality that you would think was necessary in order for him to be an apostle of Christ.
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:14.660]   But just so that you and I don't understand that we focus our attention on the wrong thing,
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:17.660]   Paul says, "No, that's not why I was chosen.
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:20.660]   Because I was the worst of sinners."
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:22.660]   I was the worst of sinners.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:23.660]   For what?
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:25.660]   So that, for what reason?
[01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:32.660]   That his perfect patience, his perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in him for eternal life,
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:36.660]   that if that guy, if that guy who was trying to murder us,
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:43.660]   that guy was so wrong about Christ that he murdered people, persecuted.
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:48.660]   That first persecution happened under him.
[01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:54.660]   If he can come into the kingdom and he can be used to highlight the mercy of God.
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:04:01.660]   You know, oftentimes we hear people say that we're kind of diamonds in the rough and we're in the dirt.
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:05.660]   And so God has perfect vision and so he knows our potential better than us.
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:13.660]   So he finds a diamond in the rough and then he touches us and cleans us up so that we can live up to the full potential.
[01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:16.660]   That's not what the scripture says.
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:25.660]   Scripture tells us that it's not the full potential that he's releasing because the purpose of the cross is to highlight Christ.
[01:04:25.660 --> 01:04:27.660]   What he's done.
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:35.660]   He's given unworthy people, a tax collector who deserve nothing, for what purpose?
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:38.660]   To highlight his mercy.
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:40.660]   To highlight his glory.
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:44.660]   Not our potential glory, but his glory.
[01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:48.660]   And that's why Paul says, "When I am weak, he is strong."
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:52.660]   The goal of a Christian life is not to tap into our potential.
[01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:57.660]   The goal of a Christian life is in our weakness to point to Christ.
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:06.660]   That if somebody like Apostle Paul, somebody like Matthew, can be forgiven of their sins and used for his kingdom.
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:13.660]   See, Matthew's choice as a disciple gives hope to the prostitutes.
[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:17.660]   It gives hope to the other tax collectors.
[01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:20.660]   It gives hope to sinners.
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:23.660]   It gives hope to the poor, the insignificant.
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:27.660]   It gives hope to people who have no hope.
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:32.660]   I don't have any access to education. I don't have any access. I'm not this and I'm not that.
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.660]   You don't know my history.
[01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:41.660]   Jesus is just the choosing of his disciples just turned the table upside down.
[01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:44.660]   What was good became bad and what was bad became good.
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:50.660]   In Luke 5, 31, 32, "And Jesus answered and said to them, 'It is not those who are well who need a physician.'"
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:56.660]   And this was a rebuke against the Pharisees because they didn't know that they were sick.
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:59.660]   But he had no problem with the Pharisees.
[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:04.660]   Remember the parable that he gives in order to rebuke the Pharisees?
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:11.660]   He said, "You had two people go up and the Pharisee was bragging about how I'm not like this and I pay tithe and I keep the law."
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:14.660]   "Thank God I'm not like the tax collector."
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:17.660]   "The tax collector was beating his chest," he says. He couldn't even lift his head.
[01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:20.660]   "Forgive me for my sins."
[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:25.660]   And Jesus says, "Whose sins was forgiven? The tax collector."
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:29.660]   You know what's interesting about that parable?
[01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:32.660]   Matthew was there.
[01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:35.660]   Matthew heard what Jesus was saying.
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:39.660]   Matthew was there. You think Jesus didn't know Matthew was there?
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:43.660]   He was rebuking the Pharisee but he was confirming for Matthew.
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:49.660]   Matthew went up there and he's beating his chest because that was Matthew.
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:52.660]   Why would he choose me?
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:55.660]   I already sold out my country.
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:59.660]   This nice house that I'm living in, I took it away from that poor family.
[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:03.660]   He knew his sin. He's the guy who was beating his chest.
[01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:06.660]   There's no way that he would choose me.
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:10.660]   And Jesus tells him, "Whose sins were forgiven? Who became righteous?"
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.660]   It was Matthew.
[01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:17.660]   Matthew was there when he was telling that parable.
[01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:21.660]   He wanted to rebuke the Pharisees but he also wanted to encourage Matthew.
[01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:24.660]   "Matthew, your sins are forgiven."
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:27.660]   This is the gospel that he was trying to highlight.
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:34.660]   You know what's interesting? Matthew becomes the author of the gospel of Matthew, obviously.
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:40.660]   What's interesting about the gospel of Matthew is that it contains more Old Testament quotes than any other gospel.
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:47.660]   In fact, 99 separate times. He quotes from the Psalms, he quotes from the historical books, he quotes from the prophets.
[01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:50.660]   All throughout the Old Testament, 99 times.
[01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:55.660]   That's more than all the other gospels put together.
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:58.660]   And the reason why is because the highlight of Matthew's gospel
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:04.660]   is to connect the dots between the old prophecies about Christ and how Jesus fulfills.
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:08.660]   And so, every gospel highlights a certain aspect of Christ.
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:12.660]   Luke describes his humanity.
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:16.660]   John's gospel highlights his deity.
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:21.660]   Mark's gospel emphasizes his miracles, his works.
[01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:25.660]   Matthew's gospel highlights his kingship.
[01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:31.660]   Which is ironic because Matthew was the one who rejected Israel.
[01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:34.660]   He was the enemy of the state of Israel.
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:40.660]   He was the one that empowered the pagan nation to rule over Israel.
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:48.660]   And yet, Matthew was the one who was chosen to remind the nation of Israel that he's the king.
[01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:50.660]   He's that king.
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:56.660]   So if you were an unbeliever, you would look at that and say, "Matthew, I can't read a word that Matthew said.
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:09:00.660]   How is this traitor of our country?
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:04.660]   How is he going to tell me who the king is?"
[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:10.660]   But to those who are being saved, the highlight wasn't about Matthew.
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:16.660]   It was that even somebody like Matthew, God can save.
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:19.660]   And use him as powerfully as he can.
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:22.660]   So the highlight wasn't about Matthew.
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:26.660]   It was about the gospel of Christ.
[01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:28.660]   Matthew knew he was a sinner.
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:35.660]   You know what's interesting was when Jesus calls Matthew, his sin wasn't way behind him.
[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:38.660]   It's like, "Oh, that guy used to do this. How can we forgive him?
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:40.660]   I remember 10 years ago he used to do this."
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:43.660]   Remember when Jesus called Matthew what he was doing?
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:46.660]   He was at the tax booth.
[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:48.660]   He was at the tax booth.
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:51.660]   He was in the middle of collecting his taxes.
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:57.660]   So can you imagine the other disciples walking with Christ and pointing to Matthew and saying, "Matthew, come with me."
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:59.660]   Matthew doesn't hesitate.
[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:02.660]   He drops everything. He follows Jesus.
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:05.660]   You know what's interesting about that?
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:12.660]   That Matthew could not have possibly been educated in the synagogue because he wasn't allowed to go there.
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:17.660]   He could not have gotten any formal education about the Old Testament because he wasn't allowed.
[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:23.660]   Which means that all the things that he knew about the Old Testament, Matthew probably was studying by himself,
[01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:31.660]   but he probably knew he's the worst of sinners, but there was a hunger for God that he couldn't join the regular community.
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:42.660]   But can you imagine when Jesus said, "No, you come with me," that in his heart, even in the middle of his sin, he was searching for God.
[01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:44.660]   I don't know about you.
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:46.660]   I don't know about you.
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:52.660]   But I know if you've been a Christian for any period of time, you know exactly how that feels like.
[01:10:52.660 --> 01:11:00.660]   In the middle of your struggle, in the middle of your compromise, in the deep sense of your heart, you know you want God.
[01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:03.660]   But you're wrestling with your sin.
[01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.660]   Can God forgive me?
[01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:08.660]   Even after all these years, I'm still struggling with this.
[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.660]   Can God still forgive me?
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:16.660]   And it is our own sense of justice that keeps us away from his grace.
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:18.660]   I think that was Matthew.
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:22.660]   That Matthew was very interested in the Messiah.
[01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:25.660]   And that's why he knew so much about the Old Testament.
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:30.660]   But he couldn't possibly fathom, "How can I possibly go to him?
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:33.660]   Why would he possibly choose me?"
[01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:36.660]   And yet, Jesus said, "Come."
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:41.660]   And the Scripture tells us that he dropped everything. Immediately, he went to him.
[01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:51.660]   You know, the Scripture says, "Those who have been forgiven much also love much."
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:12:00.660]   Matthew, I bet you, the whole time he was with Jesus, loved Christ deeply.
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:06.660]   That every time the Pharisees, like, "He's with that tax collector?
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:11.660]   He's eating with him? He's walking with him? That guy?"
[01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:16.660]   Because I don't think anybody ever let Jesus forget or let him forget who he was.
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:22.660]   And every time there was an indictment against Matthew, he remembered, "Only by the grace of God.
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:26.660]   Only by the grace of God."
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:27.660]   He loved Jesus.
[01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:33.660]   Even though he—you know, what's interesting about Matthew's gospel is Matthew rarely mentions anything about himself.
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:38.660]   He's just in the background. He's just keeping the record, "This is the king. This is the king. This is the king."
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:43.660]   And outside of what he pens about Jesus, we know nothing about Matthew's personality, character, nothing.
[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:50.660]   All we know is he does—he writes this awesome gospel, but he's just in the background.
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:52.660]   That's Matthew.
[01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:58.660]   This is a state of a humble sinner who's been saved by the grace of God.
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:02.660]   And that's you and I, every single one of us.
[01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:10.660]   None of us—I don't know, man, how much Bible you know, how much accolades or experiences.
[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:16.660]   None of us are here by even an ounce of our own righteousness.
[01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:19.660]   It's because while we were yet sinners, Christ called us.
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:26.660]   In fact, in Romans 5, 6 through 10, it says, "For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly."
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:31.660]   Verse 8, "But God demonstrates his long life toward us. While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:37.660]   Verse 10, "For while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son."
[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:47.660]   While we were helpless, while we were sinners, while we were enemies, Christ chose to love us and called us.
[01:13:47.660 --> 01:14:00.660]   See, the core of our worship is recognizing this grace that you and I are under, and we come to Christ to worship him, to celebrate him.
[01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:07.660]   That's why the Bible is so clear about grumbling, because a grumbling person cannot be worshiping God.
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:13.660]   You know, what's interesting is, you know, recently somebody won $1.5 billion. I forgot where it was, right?
[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:22.660]   I don't know if some of you guys were watching to see where this was going to happen, but I think it was second to the largest lottery ever.
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:30.660]   You know, what's interesting is whenever the lottery is won, there's always an article that follows saying, "Well, he doesn't actually get $1.5 billion."
[01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:39.660]   If you consider the taxes and the payment that he gets, and if you calculate all the things that he has to do, it actually only comes out to $470 million.
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:46.660]   So, it's not $1.5 billion, right? He hasn't really won $1.5 billion.
[01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:57.660]   He's like, "Are you serious?" You know who's not doing that? The guy who won $470 million.
[01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:05.660]   I bet you that guy is not calculating. "Oh my gosh, they took almost a billion dollars. What kind of injustice is this?
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:13.660]   What kind of a taxation is this? We need to fight the system. I got to get that billion dollar back."
[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:20.660]   I bet you he's going home, "I won $470 million."
[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:29.660]   Every single Christian is a Matthew who did not deserve the grace of God, who was chosen to spite.
[01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:36.660]   As a result, we live the rest of our lives celebrating and thanking him, praising him for what he has done.
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:50.660]   The moment that we forget that you and I are Matthews, and we revert back to our old system, we've become grumblers, complainers.
[01:15:50.660 --> 01:16:00.660]   "Yeah, I got $1.5 billion, but why did you take that much money? I could have done so much more with $1.5 billion instead of $470 million."
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:08.660]   As ridiculous as that sounds, that's what it must sound like in the ears of our God.
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:15.660]   "I gave you my son. I gave you my son, and you're complaining because you don't have enough money?
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:21.660]   You're complaining because you don't have enough friends? You're complaining because of this and that?"
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:33.660]   The whole reason why Matthew was chosen was to nullify the world system and to bring in the good news.
[01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:46.660]   I pray that every single one of us in this room recognize every week in a deepening fashion what it is exactly that we have in Christ.
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:53.660]   That as Jesus said to the Samaritan woman, "There's going to come a time whether you worship in this mountain or that mountain,
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:17:01.660]   that that's not going to be the primary concern, that our God is searching for people who will worship him in spirit and in truth,
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:07.660]   and that that would become our primary goal in life, the primary reason why we gather,
[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:16.660]   the primary reason why we study the Word of God, to be worshipers so that God would receive what he deserves for his sacrifice.
[01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:18.660]   Let's pray.
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:37.660]   As our team comes up, I want you to read the lyrics of the song that we're going to sing as our closing praise.
[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:45.660]   It says, "O come, all you unfaithful, come weak and unstable, come, know you are not alone.
[01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:50.660]   O come, barren and waiting ones, weary of praying, come.
[01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:57.660]   So what your God has done, see what your God has done, Christ is born, Christ is born, Christ is born.
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:18:04.660]   O come, bitter and broken, come with fears unspoken, come, taste of his perfect love, O come, guilty and hiding ones,
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:10.660]   there is no need to run, see what your God has done, Christ is born, Christ is born.
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:17.660]   He's the Lamb who was given, slain for our pardon, his promise is peace for those who believe.
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:23.660]   He's the Lamb who was given, slain for our pardon, his promise is peace for those who believe.
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:32.660]   So come, though you have nothing, come, he is the offering, come, see what your God has done."
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:39.660]   Heavenly Father, we come with empty hands.
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:50.660]   Help us, Lord God, to remember that we were sinners, unworthy of what you've given us.
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:58.660]   That every day that you would fill our hearts with praise and thanksgiving,
[01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:07.660]   that your name may be magnified, that you would renew the life that oftentimes is suffocated
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:13.660]   because we have fixed our eyes on things that don't matter in eternity.
[01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:21.660]   Help us, Lord God, to become true worshipers, that we would celebrate as Matthew did when he was chosen.
[01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:26.660]   May your name be honored, may your church be filled with true worship.
[01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:29.660]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:32.660]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:56.660]   "Oh come, all you unfaithful, come, weak and unstable, come, know you are not alone.
[01:19:56.660 --> 01:20:11.660]   Oh come, barren and braiding ones, weary of praying, come, see what your God has done.
[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:32.660]   Christ is born, Christ is born, Christ is born for you.
[01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:48.660]   Oh come, bitter and broken, come, with fears unspoken, come, taste of his perfect love.
[01:20:48.660 --> 01:21:03.660]   Oh come, empty and hiding ones, there is no need to run, see what your God has done.
[01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:20.660]   Christ is born, Christ is born, Christ is born for you.
[01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:36.660]   He's the Lamb who was given, slain for our pardon, his promise is peace for those who believe.
[01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:53.660]   He's the Lamb who was given, slain for our pardon, his promise is peace for those who believe.
[01:21:53.660 --> 01:22:08.660]   So come, though you have nothing, come, he is the offering, come, see what your God has done.
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:24.660]   Christ is born, Christ is born, Christ is born for you.
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:39.660]   Christ is born, Christ is born, Christ is born for you.
[01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:50.660]   Let's pray.
[01:22:50.660 --> 01:23:00.660]   Isaiah 55, verse 1, "Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters, and you who have no money, come, buy and eat.
[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:05.660]   Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost."
[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:14.660]   Lord, we pray that a deepening understanding of the glory of the gospel of Christ would penetrate so deeply in our hearts
[01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:20.660]   that all that we do and say would be an overflow of the tremendous grace that you've given us.
[01:23:20.660 --> 01:23:26.660]   Help us, Lord God, to have an eternal perspective, knowing that what it is that we have in Christ,
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:30.660]   that we would enter your courts with thanksgiving in our hearts,
[01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:37.660]   that we would become more and more each week, worshipers who will worship you in spirit and in truth.
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:42.660]   Help us to be a church that celebrates your grace, that practices this grace,
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:45.660]   that we may live up to this grace that you've given.
[01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:48.660]   So we pray, Father God, for guidance.
[01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:52.660]   Send us, Lord God, that we may be the aroma of Christ wherever you send us.
[01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.660]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:24:00.660]   God sent his Son.
[01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:05.660]   They called him Jesus.
[01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:10.660]   He came to love.
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:15.660]   Heal and forgive.
[01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:20.660]   He lived and died.
[01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:25.660]   To buy my poverty.
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:35.660]   An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lived.
[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:45.660]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:55.660]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:25:05.660]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:21.660]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:26.660]   We thank you for your grace.
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:31.660]   We thank you for your grace.
