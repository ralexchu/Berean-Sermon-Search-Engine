[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.820]   So, I wanted to share with you guys that we have a cool graphic for the next Bible study
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.600]   and again as a, before we jump in, jump in, as a quick reminder, please do take a moment
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.000]   to sign up for our next Bible study.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.600]   It's going to be called Every Blessing in Christ, okay?
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.880]   Study through Ephesians.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.560]   Now, this book is ending, the book of Philippians, and it reads, "Now to our God, the Father,
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.040]   be the glory forever and ever.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.080]   Amen.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.600]   Greet every saint in Christ Jesus and the brethren who are with me greet you.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.760]   All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.320]   The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.320]   Amen."
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.280]   Now, this is the conclusion and some of these statements sound just, I guess, clichÃ©-ish,
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.480]   so to speak, or just kind of standard in terms of its conclusion.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.400]   But there are pieces or elements of the conclusion that we should observe and I've highlighted
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.400]   them for you here.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.800]   That there is this glory forever to the Lord focus.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.600]   There is also the greeting going back and forth where they should be greeting other
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.600]   saints.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.800]   First and foremost, more the saints that are with Apostle Paul is greeting them.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.400]   And then lastly, his desire to bless them with the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.160]   So in summary, there is both all these different elements, doxology, a command.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.540]   There is a relaying or sending of greetings.
[00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.000]   We send you greetings, right?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.040]   And then blessings in the grace of Christ.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.080]   These aren't necessarily things that you have to retain and remember, but it's good to even
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.040]   in the conclusion notice some of these things.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.040]   Because some of these things really, you know, Apostle Paul, inspired by the Spirit, is really
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.140]   summarizing certain important things and then he's leaving lasting thoughts before the conclusion
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.120]   of the letter, okay?
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.360]   What I like to do is focus on this, the doxology.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.080]   When the Scripture says, "Now to our God and Father be glory forever and ever.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.080]   Amen."
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.920]   Have you guys sometimes read certain things?
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.960]   It just sounds too high churchy, just kind of reminds you of high cathedral stained glass.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.600]   Almost, you know, you almost kind of picture maybe what mainstream media has depicted as
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.880]   a form of religiosity, what's like, "And to our God forever and ever."
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.000]   And you almost feel a fakeness to it.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.880]   Now that's sad.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.920]   Why?
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.880]   Because those statements that are so, I guess you could say, magnanimous, like so epic,
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.040]   "Now to our God and Father be glory forever and ever.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.600]   Amen."
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.840]   I bet actually in those days the Christians saw it as such a huge privilege to be able
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.840]   to say stuff like that, right?
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.000]   And as a matter of fact, when Apostle Paul is saying that, I'm sure he's filled with
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.800]   this, I guess, fullness of both conviction, emotion, right?
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.640]   To say, "And glory must go to God through all time, forever and ever, in all place."
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.640]   Right?
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.160]   And I would have to say again, maybe we would shy away from saying these epic statements
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.200]   because it sounds too lofty, but as a matter of fact, it causes us to really think and
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.720]   think deeply about the issue.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.320]   So I want us to take a moment to think about that, that as we look at the closing, I want
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.360]   us to think about the glory of God.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.480]   I want us to think about what gives glory to the Lord.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.160]   I want us to think about how Paul, even through this letter, gives glory to the Lord.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.840]   I want us to think about how Paul expects the entire church to give honor and glory
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.840]   to the Lord, right?
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.760]   And then obviously even for us, I want us to think about whether we can say what Apostle
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.840]   Paul is saying with such great conviction, that now and forevermore, God deserves all
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.840]   glory.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.840]   Amen.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.840]   Right?
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.240]   And every time we take moments again to think about this, we have to again just kind of
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:22.600]   meditate deeply about just even that simple phrase, that we need to glorify God.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:30.480]   So what I like to do is walk through, walk through my plan of kind of reviewing.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.560]   It was a little tough trying to think about the best way to review such a kind of a deep
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.320]   and such an encouraging book.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.880]   But what I'm going to do is two punch, okay?
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.640]   First punch is going to be, I'm going to walk through and then highlight for you what I
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.840]   believe is the attitudes that glorify God.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.880]   The attitudes that glorify God.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.040]   I'm going to, bear with me, walk through all four chapters and talk to you about the perspective
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.320]   and attitude that Apostle Paul exhibited that gives glory to God and therefore he's concluding
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.120]   with and now glory needs to go to God forever.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.680]   And then the second punch is going to be, hold on, I lost my place a little bit.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.320]   What is the second punch?
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.320]   Oh, commands.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.320]   Sorry about that.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.520]   I asked you the question.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.280]   The perspectives or the attitudes and the second part is going to be the direct commands
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.920]   that Apostle Paul gives that also gives glory to the Lord.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.920]   Okay?
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.160]   So let's walk down through this together.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.280]   I have essentially on your handout the outline of this book twice.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.200]   The first time we're going to go through this idea of the attitudes that give glory to the
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.200]   Lord.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.880]   If you recall, I made much of this concept of the attitude because what we saw in the
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:55.760]   book of Philippians was Apostle Paul trying to communicate first and foremost his faith.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.160]   And as he was doing that, he was challenging the church saying you need to have this same
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.160]   attitude.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.240]   And in many ways those are kind of synonymous terms because the biblical idea of attitude
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:16.060]   is a way of thinking that you're exercising your mind, that you are having a clear rationale.
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.640]   And so whether you want to call it perspective, like how you are seeing the world, how you're
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.800]   seeing and interpreting the scenario, how you're exercising your evaluation of stuff,
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:33.720]   how you're judging your circumstances, all of that actually is an exercise of faith.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.900]   All of that is an exercise of faith.
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.520]   And so what I'd like to highlight again is Apostle Paul inspiring the church in how differently
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.680]   he is seeing and interpreting all of his life scenarios, how he is looking at the spiritual
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.480]   reality and not just his physical reality.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.640]   So that's what I'm going to highlight as I go through these various chapters.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:00.700]   So in the very first chapter, we have these different elements where Apostle Paul begins
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.440]   with the introduction and then he starts to express his love.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.780]   Remember how he said, "I feel this way about you.
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.920]   It's only right and I'm so confident that Jesus is going to, he who started a good work
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.160]   is going to complete it."
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.760]   And he expressed his deep love for them.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.580]   But one of his goals for this entire book was to explain to them how he sees his current
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.260]   circumstance.
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.980]   You guys already all know the church saw his dire need and wanted to help.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.020]   The church was worried.
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:35.100]   I mean, the whole, I guess, Christian community would have been very worried to see this apostle
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.100]   now in prison.
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:43.180]   Now, if you recall what Apostle Paul said was, "I want to update you, but I want you
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.900]   to understand that his circumstances actually proved to further the gospel."
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:54.620]   And so what he says is that Christ is proclaimed through his circumstances.
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:00.460]   And what I'd like to highlight to you is as he is thinking through that, my circumstances
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.100]   has now produced greater fruit for the gospel.
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:09.980]   He explains his perspective and he says, "Whether by life or death, Christ may be exalted."
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.700]   And he says, "Whether by life or death, in my body even now," and he says, "for me to
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:18.740]   live is Christ and to die is gain."
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.940]   And so on your outline, those are the simple blanks for you guys, right?
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.940]   Apostle Paul has this mindset, and I'm going to tell you this, in terms of for me, the
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:32.780]   entire book, the book of Philippians, if there was one section, and there's so many different
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:38.060]   sections, but one section I had to memorize, I would memorize this section, chapter 1,
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.340]   verses 12 to 26.
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.100]   Smaller portion of it I want to review with you.
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.220]   He says this, "Now I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstances have turned out for
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.340]   the greater progress of the gospel."
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.700]   Skipping forward to verse 18, he asks, "What then?"
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:00.220]   Remember he describes that in terms of the progress of the gospel, he describes it as
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:07.520]   how the praetorian guards, where he's at, there are people who are actually being bold.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.140]   If there was a certain place where you'd be super shy that you're a Christian, if there
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:17.820]   were a certain place where you would be very, very cautious, it would be there, essentially
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.060]   at the capital.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:24.700]   And so one of the questions that I asked you was, "Oh, what is this whole idea of the Caesar's
[00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.100]   household?"
[00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:31.100]   I don't think that he actually means Caesar's relative, brother, or something like that.
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.100]   We're talking about people who are in that realm.
[00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.540]   For example, if we say, "Oh, somebody in the White House," when we say White House, we're
[00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:43.380]   talking about huge numbers of people, swaths of president's cabinet, people who are working.
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.200]   Now all that to say, not only then were there good things happening where people were being
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.980]   bold, where people were being all the more brave about their faith, there were other
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:52.980]   things happening too.
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.540]   Paul says, "For sure, there are some who are all messed up."
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:01.140]   So if you're following along in your Bibles, we're looking at all these various things,
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.400]   but what I want to highlight to you again is Paul's perspective.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.180]   When he asks us rhetorically, "What then?"
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:15.180]   He is actually asking us to think along with him in faith.
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.220]   He is asking us to interpret in a godly fashion.
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.940]   If you see that there are people who are preaching out of false motives, if you see that I'm
[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.780]   in prison, if you see all this stuff going on, how are you going to judge this?
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:32.300]   Are you going to have this kind of very embittered, like, "What in the world are they doing?
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.300]   How could they do this?"
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.020]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know?
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.620]   Or are you going to be looking at the big picture from God's angle?
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.460]   And what does he say?
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:47.460]   He says, "Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed.
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.140]   And in this, I rejoice.
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:54.500]   Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.060]   prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:03.020]   According to my earnest expectation and hope that I will not be put to shame in anything,
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:08.100]   but that with all boldness, Christ will even now as always be exalted in my body, whether
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.100]   by life or by death, for to me," and when he says that, again, I'm highlighting for
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:18.940]   you in blue all the places where he is expressing to us his faith.
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:24.620]   When he says, "For me," he's giving us his rationale.
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.620]   How is he thinking?
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:32.580]   For him, to live is Christ and to die is gain, right?
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.780]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:39.380]   And what's crazy about this is not only is this his expectation, not only is this his
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:45.060]   reality and hope, check a look at this verse in verse 29 where he says, "For," so he's
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:52.020]   continuing his rationale, "For to you and to me, it has been granted for Christ's sake
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:57.940]   not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake."
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.500]   Now, take a moment to meditate on this.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:06.900]   We're talking about attitude, we're talking about change of perspective.
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:12.720]   He is radically changing what is normal to human interpretation.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:19.540]   You take something like getting unjustly jailed, I mean, think about an American citizen who
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.620]   is falsely accused and then thrown into prison.
[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.320]   I mean, talk about somebody who would be livid.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.420]   Talk about somebody who's going to fight for their rights.
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:32.340]   Talk about somebody who's going to come out and make sure he gets paid millions because
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.460]   he's been unjustly prisoned, right?
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:43.820]   He is radically changing our judgment, our interpretation of current realities and taking
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:48.660]   something that every single person would say, "This is horrible," and he says, "No, this
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.220]   has caused a greater advancement of the gospel.
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.220]   This is good.
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.220]   I rejoice."
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.700]   Man, I think about that and what a huge eye-opener.
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.300]   What craziness.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.780]   If any of us was there and you started talking to him, let's say you visited him in jail
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.580]   and you're like, "Oh my gosh," and you went over there crying, you brought to him gifts,
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:14.420]   you brought to him blankets, and he looked at you and said, "Why are you sad?
[00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.420]   I'm happy," right?
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.940]   I think part of us would even think like, "Dude, Paul, I get it.
[00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.660]   You're holy and stuff, but please don't fake it."
[00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:28.100]   I wonder if you actually played that entire scene, if somebody actually thought like that
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.860]   in front of you, you'd almost be like, "Yeah, I get it.
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.860]   I get it.
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.700]   We all have to try to be happy."
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:43.500]   I wonder, but I actually know he says he is completely showing us a grand, grand shift,
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.420]   a grand shift in perspective.
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:52.460]   And I tried to think of a better analogy for this, and honestly speaking, I couldn't.
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:57.900]   I was thinking about, "Were there moments of hardship and suffering and difficulty and
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.380]   pain and all this kind of stuff," right?
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.620]   But I couldn't think of a good analogy for this.
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:10.620]   In a sense, this is where you exercise your faith, and I'm not sure if there's just another
[00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:15.020]   good analogy to explain this, but there is something that, as I was trying to think of
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:20.900]   an analogy, I got really, really convicted, like, "Wow."
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:28.620]   Even for every single one of us, I believe that our perspective, like our judgment upon
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:37.500]   our own lives, whether it's good, bad, fitting, pleasing, man, it can be radically, radically
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.860]   challenging.
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:44.120]   And so at this moment, I wanna kind of extend this moment for you to reflect on that.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:49.140]   If there were moments for you, when you were evaluating, you were kind of summing up your
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:55.100]   life, and you started having these thoughts of like, "Oh my goodness, my life is horrible.
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.100]   This is unfair.
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.620]   I deserve better than this."
[00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.660]   If you had certain moments like that, I mean, be challenged.
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:07.460]   Be challenged to ask, "How were you deciding that?
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.100]   By what criteria were you deciding that?
[00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:15.340]   What was your operating standard by which you made those judgments?"
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:19.140]   And then all of a sudden, we get really, really convicted, right?
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:24.660]   Because especially, especially when we have hardships and suffering, sometimes maybe,
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:31.380]   maybe, I think we can fall into this kind of perhaps dangerous thinking, where we might
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:37.180]   ask this question, "Okay, I do believe in Jesus, but in what way is Jesus going to help
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.180]   if I'm suffering?"
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.900]   Let me repeat that, okay?
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.060]   As I was thinking about this, there was just a moment I was thinking about, or I guess
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.980]   a scenario I was thinking about, where if we have incredible suffering or if we have
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:53.540]   a very, very hard time that we can't get out of, perhaps we might be tempted to think,
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:58.660]   in these moments of hardship, in these moments of difficulty, "How is believing in Jesus
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.660]   going to help me?"
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.660]   Okay?
[00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:06.980]   And what's crazy about this is that Apostle Paul completely changes that whole question
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:13.180]   upside down by giving us this perspective that we see even here.
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:19.300]   That to us, we've been granted, graced, gifted, for Christ's sake, not only to believe in
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.580]   Him, but also to suffer for Him.
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:28.100]   So someone can respond, "Yes, we may ask the question, 'How is Jesus going to help us?
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.780]   What promises does He have?
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.380]   How are we going to be strengthened?'
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.380]   All those things, yes, are good."
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.060]   But here, there's this entirely different question.
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:44.460]   And the question absolutely changes our worldview to ask, not, "How is Jesus going to help me?"
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.900]   but, "What good am I?
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:50.620]   How am I useful to God in this?"
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.980]   Right?
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:57.500]   It's not for us to ask, "If and when we ever felt like Jesus Christ was useless, if ever
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:04.600]   we felt like Jesus Christ was of no avail," the answer to that would be, "Wrong question.
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.820]   To what degree am I useful to God?"
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:12.060]   That is a radical change, radical change in perspective.
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.060]   Okay.
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:18.540]   So I spent a long time on that because you guys recall as we studied through this book,
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.100]   Apostle Paul did this many times.
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:26.420]   He takes a certain scenario that maybe we would naturally react to, and his perspective,
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.660]   his faith radically changes how we judge everything.
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:37.380]   So moving forward to chapter 2, there was another attitude that Apostle Paul highlighted,
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:44.600]   and that was the attitude of unity in spirit, in mind, and love through the humble attitude
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.600]   of Christ.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.600]   Okay?
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.600]   The humble attitude of Christ.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.480]   That was in chapter 2.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.180]   If you recall, this was the passage.
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:57.340]   It talked about how Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, right?
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:04.160]   The context is He was God, but He did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped,
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.480]   but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bondservant.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:13.000]   And being made in the likeness of men, being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.620]   by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:23.180]   For this reason also, God highly exalted Him and bestowed on Him the name which is above
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.200]   every name, so that at the name of Jesus, every knee will bow of those who are in heaven
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.360]   and on earth, and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:35.400]   is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:40.360]   So recall, remember how I began with asking you the question, "What is God glorified by?"
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.960]   It's pretty crazy, right?
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:51.000]   To think that God is glorified by Jesus laying down His life, by Jesus humbling Himself,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.640]   right?
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.980]   Now I want you to think about this.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.920]   Perhaps in this generation, people think what glorifies God is when we excel.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.280]   Okay, let me repeat that.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:09.320]   I think a lot of people presume that what glorifies God is when I score, when I win,
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:14.240]   when I succeed, and when I fulfill my great potential.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.240]   Now could it?
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.240]   Yes.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.760]   If athletes give thanks to God and give glory to God because God created my body, that gives
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.120]   glory to the Lord.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.880]   If you excel in your business and you give glory to God because you know that the business
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:35.160]   is not yours but His, if you use your mind and you excel in academics, all of that when
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.240]   you give thanks and acknowledge God is glory to God, amen?
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.080]   But is that the only way?
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.040]   Why is it that some people presume that you have to score in order to give glory to God,
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.160]   but otherwise it doesn't happen?
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.160]   Very contrary to what the Scripture is saying because Scripture, Scripture talks about how
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:01.800]   self-sacrifice, self-humbling, a willingness to die to self and submitting yourself for
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:07.280]   the sake of others, for the sake of God, for the sake of His purpose, that that glorifies
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.180]   God.
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:13.740]   Because when we lower ourselves, God Himself will raise us up.
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:18.740]   And it's Him who's going to elevate and therefore it's Him who's going to be glorified.
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:23.820]   And what's more, the example that Jesus Christ has laid down.
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:28.420]   And when people acknowledge that, that is going to be to the glory of the Lord.
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:34.460]   Okay, so in chapter 3, a connection to that is this.
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:39.380]   I think when we think about our kind of example that Apostle Paul said, it's Jesus' humility
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:46.660]   and self-sacrifice, if we're thinking really honestly, we should be all admitting like
[00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.820]   that is so difficult to do, right?
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:56.920]   I mean, self-sacrifice, humbling yourself, being willing to submit underneath all the
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.780]   various things that here in the green that Jesus Christ did.
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:06.380]   I mean, in all honesty, even when I know I am wrong, I don't know, it's difficult to
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.660]   humble yourself, right?
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:13.420]   In that scenario then, we should all be able to admit, man, it is very difficult.
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:21.260]   However, I think in Apostle Paul's perspective, what he reveals to us enables and empowers
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.660]   us to do so, okay?
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:30.660]   And that next part is, after in chapter 3, going through various things of warnings,
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:35.340]   after going through explanation of the people who are putting confidence in their flesh,
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:40.380]   you guys know that he talks about how all things, he starts to praise stuff.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.520]   You think these things are valuable?
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.820]   You think holding up your stature is valuable?
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.740]   You think your accolades are valuable?
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.780]   You think your confidence is valuable?
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:55.620]   And he tells us, "Whatever things were gained to me, those things I have counted as loss
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.860]   for the sake of Christ.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:02.460]   More than that, I count all things to be lost in view of the surpassing value of knowing
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:07.820]   Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:12.060]   rubbish so that I may gain Christ."
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.180]   I highlighted for you those words.
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:20.340]   I count, I count the view and the counting, right?
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:24.420]   Because as an admonition and challenge to us right now, I'm going through these chapters
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:31.020]   talking about perspective, talking about your rationale, talking about our value systems,
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.020]   talking about how you judge and how you see.
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.220]   What is valuable in your eyes?
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.300]   That is such a huge question, right?
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.940]   What is valuable in your eyes?
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:50.380]   And Apostle Paul expresses to us that in his view, Christ is the goal.
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.540]   Winning means to have Jesus.
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:59.060]   Having everything but not having Jesus means utter bankruptcy, that there's no crisis bigger
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.780]   than being far from Christ.
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:05.620]   And here, I would like to take a moment, you know I feel like in the last like six months
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:09.780]   or so because we've walked through Hebrews, a lot of the church has been talking about
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.180]   drifting.
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.620]   People have been very convicted about it.
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:19.220]   People have been very moved that drifting is dangerous and whatnot, right?
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:27.040]   But the fact of the matter is, have we in our own experience, have we experienced drifting
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.580]   but then didn't feel the sense of urgency, right?
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:37.140]   Didn't feel the sense of like, gasp, I'm far from my Savior.
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:44.140]   I want to take a moment to think about that because right now, if we're saying that every
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:50.780]   single thing I have, every single thing that makes me feel like I'm okay, whether it is
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:57.500]   my job, finances, the people around me, right, that even if I had all those things, I would
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:02.700]   literally be bankrupt because I have nothing worthy, I have nothing valuable if I don't
[00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.020]   have Jesus.
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:10.340]   And the challenge is for us to actually by faith feel like the greatest disaster I could
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:15.420]   ever be in is to be far from my Savior, right?
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:20.380]   That the worst crisis, like oh no moment, shouldn't be when I lose my job.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:27.460]   It should be if I realize I'm far from my Savior, that should radically shake me if
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:34.140]   I'm appropriately seeing Jesus as my treasure like Paul, right?
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:41.420]   That to us, being far from my God would be the most depressing.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:48.540]   Drifting from my Savior and not being intimate with my Jesus would be the saddest, most despairing
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.780]   moments of my life.
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:57.420]   Not when I don't have means, not when I don't have freedoms, but when I'm far from the will
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.220]   of my God, right?
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:06.340]   And the opposite is the way that Apostle Paul presents it though, that to him, Jesus is
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.580]   of such surpassing value.
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:15.580]   He will literally suffer all loss because all those things he counts as rubbish.
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.580]   Man.
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:23.300]   I know, I'll finish soon, okay?
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.700]   But man, just think about the perspective.
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:32.780]   If we were to grow in any way through the book of Philippians, sometimes it's not practical,
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.820]   like go do this, right?
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.140]   Sometimes it's not.
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:47.500]   Sometimes you just deepening that urgency to worry from falling into apathy and not
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:53.340]   feeling that urgency, that alone to you then is the greatest application.
[00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:57.580]   If that you're going to worry about anything, your worries and concerns are based on your
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.660]   Savior, that to you is your application.
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:05.260]   And I wanted to make sure that we have that perspective.
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:09.260]   In chapter four, Apostle Paul goes through many different commands that we're going to
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.380]   go through a little bit later.
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.940]   He urges to stand firm.
[00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.420]   He urges for unity.
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.180]   He commands to rejoice in the Lord.
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:23.140]   But the perspective that was so challenging was Apostle Paul's perspective, his faith,
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:29.260]   his rationale, his thinking, his attitude on how he could be content in the Lord, how
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:33.700]   he could be giving thanks in every single circumstance.
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:38.420]   And so if you recall in chapter four, he says, "Not that I speak from want, for I have learned
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:41.780]   to be content in whatever circumstance I am.
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:46.860]   I know how to get along with humble means, and I also know how to live in prosperity.
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:52.180]   In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry,
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:55.820]   both of having abundance and suffering need.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:01.340]   I can do all things through Him who strengthens me."
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:04.380]   What incredible confidence, right?
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:10.380]   By faith in the Lord, by having that treasure in Jesus, what incredible stability, what
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.380]   a massive amount of strength, right?
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:20.020]   That even on either sides of the spectrum, you know, either sides of the experience,
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.420]   I know how to be content.
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:27.500]   And you could think, you could think about Apostle Paul's experience.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.980]   Whatever it is to us, the degree by which we have experienced hardship, and some of
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:35.580]   you here have experienced hardship a lot more than others.
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:36.580]   That's just the reality.
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:42.220]   You've just suffered through lots of different things that maybe a lot of people have not.
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:48.220]   But you can imagine whatever is our experience to this scale that Apostle Paul has gone through
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.780]   quite a bit, right?
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.780]   His scale is quite large.
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:57.340]   I mean, he's gone from being like a ruler, a Pharisee of Pharisees, studying under the
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:02.620]   highest, you know, in terms of his educational accolades, it's incredible, right?
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.780]   He name drops and it's like, "Whoa," right?
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:12.500]   On the flip side, he's been on almost this going hungry, working night and day, being
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:19.180]   ridiculed, being falsely accused, jailed, shipwrecked, beaten, almost dying by being
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.180]   whipped.
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.420]   I mean, talk about the spectrum.
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:28.180]   And then to have this perspective, but I've learned.
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.740]   I've learned through all that how to be content.
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:35.540]   Wow, what a challenging attitude and perspective.
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:42.660]   So that being just a review, I hope that was encouraging to you that I believe the book
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:47.900]   of Philippians is so challenging because, yes, there are a lot of direct commands that
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.260]   we're supposed to apply.
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:54.500]   But I believe more so the book of Philippians was so beneficial to our faith because it
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.060]   inspires us.
[00:28:56.060 --> 00:29:00.180]   It inspires us to see with spiritual eyes.
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:04.780]   It inspires us to interpret life experiences through spiritual truth.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.420]   And that's what Apostle Paul was doing.
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.420]   Okay?
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:14.980]   Now, what Apostle Paul does though is he always goes from here, there's teaching and spiritual
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:19.060]   truth to therefore it takes this kind of effect in your life.
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.860]   And this part I'm going to go over very quickly.
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:22.860]   Okay?
[00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.700]   For chapter one, these are the commands to more, right?
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:30.100]   And I just put a blank there because there's a lot in terms of what he says in terms of
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.100]   the more.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.100]   Okay?
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:37.820]   So in chapter one, what I saw was Apostle Paul saying, "I pray that your love may abound
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.460]   still more and more."
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:40.460]   Okay?
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.500]   So the blanks for you there are more and more.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.620]   One of the challenging things for us and I really wanted to emphasize, especially to
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:52.740]   our group, was I honestly believe we have just a great core of Christians who are trying
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.660]   their best to maintain their faith.
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.940]   But dare we ever say that, "Oh, things are pretty good now.
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:00.940]   I'm okay."
[00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:01.940]   Right?
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.900]   We have to be regularly growing, desiring more and more than we were before.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.340]   And no matter where we are, we have to have this perspective.
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.340]   There's so much more that we should be doing.
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.340]   Okay?
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:15.460]   So he says, "I want you to abound more and more even if you're doing well."
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.980]   In chapter, I believe this is chapter still, chapter one.
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:25.500]   Oh no, sorry, this is chapter, yeah, this is chapter one.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:29.580]   What he says through all that, he says, "Conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:34.340]   of Christ so that whether I come to see you or remain absent, I will hear of you that
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:39.300]   you are standing firm in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.300]   gospel."
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.300]   Okay?
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:45.460]   So from there, you have a good summary of the general content of what Apostle Paul
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.180]   is trying to push the church to.
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:53.580]   Greater perseverance, greater stability, and greater unity in the proclamation of the gospel.
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:54.580]   That's it.
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:31:00.060]   He's got one main focus and there's no crazy like, "Oh," like, you know, nuance and deep
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.060]   mystery to this.
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:05.380]   He wants you to persevere, standing together, standing firm in the midst of all the ways
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:09.900]   of distraction, persecution that's coming, and making sure you're holding true to the
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.420]   faith of the gospel.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.940]   And so that's why I'm going through this quite quickly.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:19.580]   Even chapter two, in the first part of it, when he is giving that admonition for unity,
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.620]   notice how he's essentially saying the same thing.
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:25.620]   "Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:30.580]   love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, any affection and compassion, make my joy
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:36.420]   complete by being in the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.140]   one purpose.
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:43.300]   Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind, regard one another
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.780]   as more important than yourselves."
[00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:48.700]   Right?
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:56.220]   So here, he makes this connection that in terms of his joy, what would be so pleasing
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:01.140]   to him is to see the church doing this, that they're maintaining the same love, united
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.220]   in spirit and intent on one purpose.
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:10.780]   In chapter two, verse 18, he says this, "You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:14.580]   share your joy with me."
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.060]   Okay.
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.020]   What I'm going to say here is this.
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:22.740]   If you kind of follow along, just kind of walk through the trail of the various commands
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:27.800]   in the book of Philippians, again, I walked through that pretty quickly.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:35.520]   There wasn't a ton of like specific sins he was addressing, whereas maybe some books were.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.720]   There weren't tons of specific like issues that arise.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:45.720]   And even his combating false teaching or whatever it may be, some of it seemed kind of subtle.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.800]   Like we could assume, "Oh, these probably were Judaizers.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.320]   These probably were individuals who put confidence in the flesh."
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.120]   Right now, what he was saying was just this.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.240]   You guys saw the perspective of Apostle Paul?
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.240]   You guys saw the hard attitude?
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.840]   You guys saw the mentality?
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.320]   Did you see the intent and purpose of his heart?
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.520]   That he was driven to exalt Christ?
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.400]   He was happy when that happened.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.880]   And even if in the whole scale of his life experiences, early when I was talking about
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:19.560]   all the blessings to having plenty, to having little, to nothing, if in all of that, it
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.280]   meant the proclamation of Jesus, he was what?
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.720]   Happy.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:30.920]   The main admonition that Apostle Paul is going to say is, follow my example.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.880]   Join me.
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.240]   Share this joy with me.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:41.640]   If you're looking for joy in other things, I'm not sure how you're going to find it.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.640]   But there's one thing for sure.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.500]   There's one thing for sure that can cause to us a sense of, "This is right.
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.320]   This is good, and I'm doing it."
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.640]   It's glorifying the one who is worthy of glory.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.640]   It's serving the one who is worthy of all our worship and service.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.880]   And so I want to conclude with that, that the commands of Apostle Paul in the book of
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.400]   Philippians, though there were many, they had a theme.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:14.560]   It was all related to his one purpose, one single perspective of mind, of exalting Christ
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.120]   in his life.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:21.960]   And so, at that final question, when the passage said, "Now to our God and Father be the glory
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:28.120]   forever and ever, amen," we asked that question, "What gives glory to the Father?"
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.600]   What gives glory to the Father?
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.640]   So this part, let's take a moment just to think about this a little bit, and this is
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:44.520]   the challenge to you.
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:51.080]   One of the thoughts that I had was, "Man, there is this weird balance of the Christian
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:58.840]   life where on one end, you're supposed to try to do everything you can, give up of your
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:02.400]   time, your finances, your energy.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.640]   You should give yourself to the ministry.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:09.200]   You should pour yourself out, and there's all these things you should do."
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.200]   Yes?
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.880]   On the flip side, God doesn't need you.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:17.000]   God is absolutely sovereign, and whether you are doing stuff, preaching words, whether
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.720]   you're meeting people, whether you're giving all your money, actually the scripture says
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:22.720]   you could do all of that.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.120]   You could give your whole body to be burned.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.800]   God doesn't need all that stuff.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:30.320]   Do you see the weird paradox there?
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.680]   And you guys, I think, already know where I'm going with this, because we're asking
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:40.440]   the question, "Then how is God glorified through all this if we're not feeling like a need,
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:44.040]   if we're not feeling, you know, doing something as a favor for God?"
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.240]   Obviously we're not doing that.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:51.720]   And what he says is, "We're not just simply supposed to be doing this stuff."
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:57.600]   He says, "The way that you're actually pleasing to God is through faith."
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:05.480]   And you, whether it be serving, exalting, preaching boldly, giving of yourself and sacrificing,
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:12.040]   all of that was boiling down to your faith, that you believe all of that was a happy,
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:19.760]   happy, joyous thing that is right, good, and your love to the Lord, right?
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:25.680]   That in your thinking, in your perspective, and in your attitude, there is nothing more
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:31.800]   that you would be happy to do than to give God everything, and that in doing so to you,
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.600]   that would be life.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.560]   Through the middle of your life, through the beginning of your life, through the end of
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.400]   your life, all of that would be Christ, amen?
