[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   I'm gonna be reading from verses one through nine.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.600]   First Peter one, one through nine,
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.640]   and it should be actually up on the screen for you.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.920]   And I'm gonna be staying on this passage
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.400]   for most of this morning.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.540]   So let's read this together.
[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.040]   Well, I'll read it for you.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.160]   So Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.800]   to those who reside as aliens
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.320]   scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia,
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.240]   Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.700]   who are chosen according to the foreknowledge of God,
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.440]   the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit,
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.440]   to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.360]   May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.040]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.360]   who according to his great mercy
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.080]   has caused us to be born again to a living hope
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.840]   through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.200]   to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.360]   and undefiled and will not fade away,
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.960]   reserved in heaven for you,
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.880]   who are protected by the power of God
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.280]   through faith for a salvation
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.740]   ready to be revealed in the last time.
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.340]   In this, you greatly rejoice,
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.700]   even though now for a little while, if necessary,
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.180]   you have been distressed by various trials,
[00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.540]   so that the proof of your faith
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.380]   being more precious than gold, which is perishable,
[00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.580]   even though tested by fire,
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.380]   may be found to result in praise and glory and honor
[00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.580]   at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.060]   And though you have not seen him, you love him.
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.040]   And though you do not see him now,
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.540]   but believe in him, you greatly rejoice
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.960]   with joy inexpressible and full of glory,
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.180]   obtaining as the outcome of your faith
[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.940]   the salvation of your souls.
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.460]   Well, we're just a few weeks from the year 2020,
[00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.260]   and Thanksgiving, as you guys know, has just passed,
[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.380]   which means Christmas will soon be upon us.
[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.860]   For me, 2019 went by in a blink,
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.540]   and I'm assuming the same goes for a lot of you guys.
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.740]   And we have now come to December,
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.020]   and usually the end of the year and the holidays
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.340]   that come with it are accompanied by a mix of emotions.
[00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.560]   There's an excitement in the hustle and bustle,
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.360]   thinking of deals and gifts,
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.400]   but there can also be a loneliness, stress, and sadness
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.040]   that come with the holiday season as well.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.640]   For some, you've lost loved ones.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.360]   For some, you're far from loved ones.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.600]   And so the holidays bring in a weird emotion.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.400]   And it's actually made worse if you're living abroad.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.120]   We have some international students here
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.720]   who are away from home.
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.540]   There are many US citizens currently living away
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.100]   from the States, and for the holidays,
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.220]   there's an added layer of emotion,
[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.940]   just being far away from your home country.
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.260]   So my wife and I, we lived nine years abroad,
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.660]   three years in China, and six in Korea,
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.820]   and the holidays were always a little sad.
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.740]   For the 4th of July, we went to Costco,
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.300]   and we ate hot dogs because it made us feel
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.160]   a little bit more patriotic.
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.260]   One Thanksgiving, we went to Costco again
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.700]   and got ourselves a rotisserie chicken,
[00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.160]   and we washed it down with a bulgogi bake.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.140]   So needless to say, we have appreciated being back
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.540]   and celebrating the past two Thanksgivings
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.220]   here on American soil.
[00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.140]   About 10 years ago, we first got to China in December 2009.
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.660]   We were in our first year in Beijing,
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.460]   and I was actually homesick and sad.
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.900]   And I remember sitting at a cafe,
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.860]   writing up our monthly newsletter for you, for the church,
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.260]   and suddenly feeling very unhappy to be in China.
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.900]   It started with my coffee order.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.660]   I had ordered an iced Americano,
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.340]   'cause I'm a fan of ice drinks, even when it's cold.
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.120]   And the barista just took scalding hot coffee
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.780]   and poured it into ice, and all the ice melted immediately,
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.820]   and the lady just handed me a lukewarm coffee
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.400]   over melted ice.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.280]   So in my broken Chinese, I told her I had ordered
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.140]   an iced coffee, and she gave me a condescending look
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.300]   and said something back to me.
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.940]   And that was early on in our time in China,
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.060]   so I didn't quite make out everything she said,
[00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.820]   but I did hear the words winter, iced, and mayo,
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.940]   like we don't have.
[00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.780]   So I just assumed she was just telling me to go sit down,
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.780]   okay, that we don't make iced drinks in the winter.
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.300]   So I sighed, I had no way to fight back,
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.920]   took my lukewarm coffee, plopped myself down,
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.180]   began typing on my computer,
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.760]   and then I looked across the street,
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.460]   and there was a mall across the street,
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.660]   and they were doing Christmas decorations,
[00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.660]   and on the top, it actually said C-O-O-K-I-E,
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.180]   Christmas, cookie, Christmas.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.680]   And that made me even more sad, not Merry Christmas,
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.980]   not Happy Christmas, but Cookie Christmas.
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.380]   And for the life of me, I could not figure out
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.540]   what cookie Christmas was supposed to mean.
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.720]   And so I'm like, you guys didn't even get Christmas right.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.900]   And so just flooded with an immense feeling of sadness,
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.500]   and to make that even worse, just six feet from me
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.980]   was a dude just smoking a cigarette
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.360]   right under the no smoking sign,
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.780]   because at that time in Beijing,
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.560]   you could pretty much smoke anywhere,
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.820]   and many rules were just not followed.
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.260]   And I remember thinking, man, get me out of here.
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.660]   I don't belong here in China.
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.580]   If you've ever lived as an expat far away from home,
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.440]   you understand homesickness.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.480]   And when you are living in a foreign country,
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.720]   homesickness is actually to be expected.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.560]   And what causes a longing for home?
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.440]   First, there's a discomfort that comes from being
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.240]   in unfamiliar surroundings and unfamiliar expectations.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.360]   So your core values are different
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.280]   from those you may be surrounded by.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.920]   Also, there are people you love
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.920]   whom you are physically separated from.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.420]   If you had your closest family and friends with you,
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.560]   no matter where you are in the world, you're not homesick.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.200]   But for those who are expats,
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.420]   they are often far from home, far from family.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.280]   Also, living in a foreign land,
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.600]   unfortunately means there's mistreatment, ridicule,
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.080]   and even opposition as an outsider.
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.220]   And this is especially the case
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.880]   for a lot of overseas migrant workers all over the world.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.960]   The Christian is called again and again
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.200]   in the scriptures alien, stranger.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.480]   And so you and I who have put our faith in Christ
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.440]   are aliens and strangers in the world.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.480]   So for the Christian living as an alien or sojourner
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.220]   on earth, there may be seasons
[00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.900]   where the homesickness is particularly strong,
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.340]   where Maranatha, Lord come, is a prayer
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.400]   that just really comes from the deepest part of our soul.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.880]   And this happens especially when there are
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.200]   constant reminders that you do not belong
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.960]   and you can feel this way.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.080]   I mean, and you can feel this way
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.640]   even if you're living in the same area
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.760]   into which you were physically born.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.360]   So it's interesting that as a Christian,
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.780]   you become homesick for a place
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.480]   you have physically never been to.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.280]   And why?
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.560]   It's because you want to be in the presence of God
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.240]   who loved you and whom you love in return.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.000]   So homesickness is very much a part
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.080]   of the life of the people of God.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.300]   It's all over the pages of scripture.
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.200]   But 1 Peter especially is one book of the Bible
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.600]   that speaks at length to the alien,
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.280]   the sojourner, the outcast, and the persecuted.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.840]   So today we're gonna be taking a look
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.840]   and reflecting on this.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.160]   And we're gonna conclude that homesickness
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.320]   is not an abnormal thing.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.820]   It's to be expected.
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.280]   But in the midst of our longing to be home,
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.720]   how do we live as joy-filled, homesick people
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.320]   during the time of our sojourn?
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.540]   You guys know that Paul,
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.300]   we've been studying the book of Philippians as a church,
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.740]   and Paul writes in Philippians,
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.860]   "For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.020]   "I long to depart and be with Christ,
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.420]   "which is very much better," he says.
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.100]   But he commands, Paul commands a sojourner
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.800]   whose citizenship is in heaven to rejoice,
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.220]   to rejoice, to rejoice in the midst of the sojourn.
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.980]   So I'm gonna give you the outline of our sermon today.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.540]   We will be first reflecting on our Christian identity,
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.500]   and then we will think deeply upon
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.320]   and look forward to our Christian inheritance,
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.120]   and then we will see what is included
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.440]   in our Christian itinerary.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.160]   What is our purpose while we are here sojourning
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.260]   in the foreign land?
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.520]   This is an aside.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.460]   I could not find another I word
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.880]   that was close to purpose, mission, commission,
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.040]   so just deal with it, itinerary, it is, okay?
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.180]   Hopefully, the alliteration does make it help,
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.360]   make it a little easier to remember.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.700]   The Christian identity, the Christian inheritance,
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.220]   and the Christian identity, what we are supposed to do
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.700]   while we are waiting for home.
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:59.060]   So the Apostle Peter, he begins this epistle
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.420]   with a very interesting greeting.
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:05.220]   He says, "To those who reside as aliens,
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.400]   "scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia,
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.060]   "Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia."
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.700]   The word alien or foreigner became a metaphor
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.300]   describing the Christian's relationship to the world.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.620]   Believers were to understand that their identity
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.380]   was one of alien residents in foreign land.
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.260]   So the Christian's values were to be different,
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.860]   their affections and their interests were to be different.
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.340]   Even though Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia,
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.500]   and Bithynia may have been the regions they were born in,
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.680]   these Christians would never be able to comfortably
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.940]   call their birthplace home.
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.720]   Now, the Christians, they are now royalty
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.640]   in their true home, but here on earth,
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.800]   they would be treated as outsiders.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.180]   So Peter goes on to elaborate in chapter two,
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:10:00.400]   "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood,
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.200]   "a holy nation, a people for God's own possession,
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.560]   "so that you may proclaim the excellencies of him
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.580]   "who has called you out of darkness
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.640]   "into his marvelous light.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.140]   "For you were once not a people,
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.660]   "but now you are the people of God.
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.000]   "You had not received mercy,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.160]   "but now you have received mercy.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.600]   "Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.920]   "to abstain from fleshly lusts
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.580]   "which wage war against the soul."
[00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.560]   So Christians are not only aliens,
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.280]   but we're ambassadors, royal representatives of the light
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.700]   living in the place of darkness.
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.660]   So naturally, as citizens of the light
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.860]   living in a dark place, Christians would face
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.140]   varying degrees of spiritual xenophobia,
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.820]   and Peter here includes the term strangers,
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.300]   or as it is translated in other passages,
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.520]   exiles, sojourners, to further emphasize
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.480]   that the saints are not of the world
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.160]   and only passing through.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.820]   So you and I, if we have put our faith in Christ,
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.680]   we are royal ambassadors living in hostile territory.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.200]   We are not permanent residents,
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.920]   but we are simply passing through as sojourners,
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.420]   and that is the Christian identity.
[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.560]   So just as much as it would be strange for you
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.680]   to check into a hotel, look at the curtains,
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.520]   look at the bedding, go out to the store,
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:31.040]   buy new curtains, buy new sheets, and change it all up,
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.800]   just as much as it would be strange for you to do this,
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.060]   it's strange for you to treat this life
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.240]   as your permanent place of residence.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.500]   So you and I, we are aliens, we are strangers,
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.940]   we are outsiders, and this is our identity.
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:53.500]   So it's only natural if you are living the Christian life
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.620]   to be a little uncomfortable, to be a little out of sorts,
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.160]   a little homesick at all times,
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.120]   and a lot homesick when things painfully remind you of home.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.060]   All is not lost for those who are longingly waiting for home
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.940]   so 'cause Apostle Peter writes,
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.180]   "May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure."
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.860]   So while you are here, stay the course.
[00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.980]   There is a purpose to your sojourn,
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.780]   and we're gonna get to that in the third point.
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.480]   But before we do, let's take a look at what Peter says
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.460]   about what is ours in heaven.
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.580]   So what is the Christian inheritance?
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.540]   The Christian identity is we are outsiders,
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.320]   we are aliens, we are sojourners.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.900]   What is it then that we are eagerly waiting for?
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.600]   Verse three of chapter one.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.660]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.200]   who according to his great mercy
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.740]   has caused us to be born again to a living hope
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.980]   through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.960]   to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.260]   and undefiled and will not fade away,
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.820]   reserved in heaven for you,
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.980]   who are protected by the power of God
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.020]   through faith for our salvation,
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.340]   ready to be revealed in the last time.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.460]   So first, Peter writes that God the Father,
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.460]   through the life, death, and resurrection of his son,
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.600]   caused us to be born again.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.300]   So salvation is 100% a gift of God.
[00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.340]   Would you guys agree with that?
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:14.180]   Amen?
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.460]   Salvation is 100% a gift of God.
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.580]   Not a single one of us in this room
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.900]   had anything in and of ourselves
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.620]   that would have been desirable for our holy, holy, holy God.
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.380]   So salvation was planned by God,
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.220]   initiated by God, and perfected by God,
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.500]   so that not one single person in this room
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.980]   can boast of any merit or any worth.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.460]   So we are not here because there is any good in us.
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.200]   In fact, there is absolutely nothing good in us
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.620]   outside of Christ.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:50.060]   So Peter says, he goes on to say that God has caused us
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.940]   to be born again to a living hope.
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.180]   And you guys have memorized,
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.580]   a lot of you have memorized this passage,
[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.420]   but what does this mean?
[00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.940]   What is this?
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.540]   'Cause we understand the word hope, right?
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.640]   It's a desire for something favorable to happen.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.240]   Tomorrow, I hope that the sun comes out
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.740]   'cause I have to go to a ballgame or something.
[00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.900]   So you're desiring something good to happen.
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.340]   That's hope.
[00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.820]   But what is a living hope?
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.020]   And what is the difference between a non-Christian hope
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.980]   and a Christian's living hope?
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.380]   And I wanna pause and think about this a little bit.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.300]   So in the scriptures,
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.060]   we learn that the unbelieving world has zero hope.
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.680]   Everything is dying and decaying around them.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.260]   Everything in this world is wasting away.
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.780]   Everything will pass away.
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:37.940]   All that lies ahead,
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.220]   all that the unbelieving world has to look forward to
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:45.180]   is disaster and weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.460]   It is a dead hope.
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.860]   So the unbelieving world can only look backward
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.460]   in search of good since each passing day
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.660]   draws closer and closer to destruction and judgment.
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.020]   So there is constant attrition.
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.220]   The world and all who are in it are passing away
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.980]   and it can get no better than this
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.220]   is what the Bible says about the unbelieving world.
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.380]   Pleasure does not last.
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.580]   Success does not last.
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.140]   Accomplishments are fleeting.
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.460]   And as Solomon says,
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.380]   all is vanity, a chasing after what?
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:17.540]   The wind.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.820]   This is all meaningless.
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:24.580]   But the Christian, however, looks forward, right?
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.540]   Forgetting what is behind,
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.380]   reaching forward to what is ahead.
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.420]   I press on, Paul writes in Philippians chapter three.
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.920]   So the Christian's hope
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.420]   is in a bright and perfect future yet to come.
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.260]   Second Peter 3.13 reads,
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.040]   but according to his promise,
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.780]   we are looking for new heavens and a new earth
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.780]   in which righteousness abides or dwells.
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.740]   So here's the point of the living hope.
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.580]   For the Christian,
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.460]   the hope of God's thorough and perfect restoration
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.180]   and this glorious future
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.760]   is more and more reality with each passing day.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:07.660]   You are now a week closer to glory than you were last week.
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:12.700]   You are now a day closer to knowing God
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.220]   and being fully known and being fully alive,
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.580]   full of Zoe.
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.220]   The bias is passing away,
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.400]   but you are a day closer to a perfect Zoe life.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.260]   So for the unbeliever, destruction looms closer.
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.820]   For the believer, glory draws closer.
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.580]   And this is a hope that is alive.
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:35.420]   You and I, if you look through the scriptures,
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.340]   the purpose of our life is very clear.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.700]   We are created by God and for God
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.260]   to love God and to serve God.
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.220]   And the greatest satisfaction for you and me
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.820]   and the greatest delight
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.620]   awaits in knowing God fully.
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.580]   And that's what the Bible calls eternal life.
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.940]   Eternal life, aionios zoe, right?
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.060]   Eternal Zoe.
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.100]   John 17 three says, this is eternal life.
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.740]   That they may know you, the only true God
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.380]   and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.820]   So for you and for me,
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:10.540]   eternal life does not start
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.120]   the moment you breathe your last breath,
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.900]   the moment your heart stops beating.
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.780]   Eternal life for you and me,
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.500]   if you put your faith in Christ, has already started,
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.180]   if you've given your life to Christ.
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.420]   And the aionios zoe,
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.220]   you are progressing.
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:29.460]   So on this side of eternity, we only know in part,
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.880]   and we see but a poor reflection.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.140]   Whatever we understand,
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.740]   even the deep truths we understand here,
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.420]   the things that we learn, know,
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.460]   or imagine God to be like,
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.260]   cannot but be an incomplete picture,
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.460]   as it says in 1 Corinthians 13.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.260]   So our living hope is that one day
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.700]   we're gonna see God face to face.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.460]   Angels cover themselves up.
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.780]   We will see God face to face,
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.520]   and we will know him fully.
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.300]   And the creator of the universe, the Bible says,
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.300]   is gonna spend eternity,
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.100]   lavishing kindness upon kindness on us.
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.700]   He's going to spend eternity loving on us,
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.420]   Ephesians chapter one and two.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.620]   And he will spend eternity amazing us,
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.900]   awing us, to where we will not be able
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.180]   to do anything but exult in worship.
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:25.200]   And we will be in the presence of God,
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.320]   overwhelmed with joy and excitement,
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.080]   with a holy and grateful terror all at the same time,
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.720]   as we worship.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.640]   There will be no more death, mourning, crying, or pain.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.120]   There will no longer be any regret, shame, or grief.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.400]   Revelation 21 four, there will be no more sin,
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.660]   and the lamb of God will be our reward and our inheritance.
[00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.140]   So all this to say, the day is gonna come
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.980]   where you and I will know our soulmate,
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.780]   and be known by him to the fullest capacity.
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:03.180]   And my hope is that this excites you.
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.240]   In April 2006, I proposed to my wife, Becky,
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.600]   and we were engaged to be married.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.200]   The Becky I knew at that time
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.940]   had graduated from UC Berkeley, go Bears,
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.960]   came from a very good family, made really good pasta,
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.460]   really good kimchi jjigae, which is my favorite food.
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.640]   The Becky of 2006 had more money than me.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.620]   She still has more money than me
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.620]   because her money is her money, my money is her money, right?
[00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.600]   She loved dogs and children.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.320]   She drove a Honda Accord, a much better car
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.560]   than my Hyundai Accent and then my Mitsubishi Gallant.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.360]   She had an older brother and a younger sister.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.960]   She lived with her parents,
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.320]   and they had a swimming pool in their backyard.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.760]   Now, I did not marry her for any one of those things.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.800]   The goal in my proposing to her
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.600]   was not to benefit from any one of those things.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.520]   My desire and my proposal was to do life with her.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.400]   I loved her, I wanted to be with her,
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.360]   I wanted to marry her and spend my life with her.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.160]   I fell in love with the person.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.360]   I wanted the person.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:19.200]   So putting my faith in Christ
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.120]   and not longing to know him fully in heaven
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.400]   is like saying, I want all that you can give me,
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.940]   but I don't want you.
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.940]   (audience laughing)
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:36.820]   Saying that I have put my faith in Christ,
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.980]   but I don't really need heaven yet is like saying,
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.580]   I want all that you can afford me,
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.020]   I want that get out of jail free card,
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.740]   I want all of your goods, but I don't want you.
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:57.500]   I'll put up with you if I absolutely have to,
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.020]   because I want what you can give me.
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.700]   See, accepting Christ Jesus as Lord and Savior
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.300]   and becoming a member in a church,
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.860]   going out to evangelize, teaching Sunday school,
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.140]   and not looking forward to spending eternity in heaven
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:15.060]   with the Lord is kind of like wanting to be engaged forever.
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.980]   How many of you guys have ever been engaged?
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.780]   Okay, oh, so most of you have not.
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.820]   Our married families is the biggest,
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.020]   but it's like wanting to be engaged forever.
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.080]   No sane person I know wants to be engaged forever.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.720]   In fact, engagement is actually sometimes very tricky.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:39.460]   You're already committed, kind of, but not yet.
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:44.660]   You're engaged, but you're not a family unit yet.
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.580]   And engagement is a lot of work.
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.660]   Okay, so for you guys who are still single,
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.500]   you look forward to marriage,
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.340]   don't look forward to engagement, it's a lot of work.
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.780]   And almost 100% of engaged people I've ever met
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:59.180]   at some point want to be done with the engagement
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.940]   and just be married.
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.060]   A couple of months into our engagement,
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.920]   our wedding planning, I remember joking with Becky,
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:11.880]   dude, let's just go to Vegas, get married,
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.340]   so we don't have to plan this thing anymore,
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.580]   'cause we had about 700 people at our wedding.
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.100]   Let's just, let's be done with it.
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.100]   And I know that many engaged couples
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.580]   have joked in the same way.
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:25.220]   So for us, it was 11 months.
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.500]   The 11 months of our engagement were long,
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.740]   and in hindsight, they went by quickly,
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:33.940]   but I remember feeling like, man, they were very long months.
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.780]   So every engaged couple looks forward to the wedding day.
[00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.060]   If I am engaged to be married to someone,
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.940]   and I don't look forward to being married to that person,
[00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.540]   you know something is very off about the relationship.
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:50.460]   So the question is, your identity, it's in Christ,
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.660]   but the inheritance, do you want it?
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.860]   Do you want Christ, or are you in this relationship
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.140]   only for the benefits?
[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.740]   Christ is our inheritance, and this hope of knowing Christ
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.540]   and being known by Christ is imperishable and undefiled
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:07.900]   and will not fade away.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.620]   He will not break off the engagement.
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.440]   He has purchased us for himself with his blood,
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:17.020]   and he will make good on every promise
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.120]   that he has made to being a perfect husband
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.780]   to his bride, the church.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.220]   Husbands, when you guys proposed to your wife,
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.880]   did you guys make promises that you didn't keep?
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.720]   I made a bunch.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.740]   I'll cook, I'll clean, do the dishes, diapers too.
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.640]   I wrote that in a song.
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.260]   Failed miserably in most of those things, okay?
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:43.260]   But our bridegroom makes good on every promise
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.760]   that he has ever made and he will ever make
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.520]   because that's who he is.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:52.680]   And when I reflect deeply on this, my soul cries out,
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.800]   hallelujah, maranatha, Lord, come,
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.200]   let this engagement period be done with
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.280]   so I could be one with you.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.520]   Revelation 19, seven, let us rejoice and be glad
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.040]   and give glory to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.920]   and his bride has made herself ready.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.080]   We get a little snapshot of heaven.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.360]   Matthew 6, 19 to 21, it says,
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.200]   do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.800]   where moth and rust destroy or thieves breaking in steel,
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.700]   but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.080]   where neither moth nor rust destroys
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.920]   and where thieves do not break in and steal.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.040]   For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.840]   This is often misapplied by the believer.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:36.240]   Our APAK, Philippians 4, 5, you guys have learned
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.400]   over the last couple of weeks,
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.200]   our Christian common sense will tell us
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.880]   that the smartest thing that we can do
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.860]   is to store up treasures for ourselves where?
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:45.960]   In heaven.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.120]   And what does that mean?
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.760]   What does it mean for you to store up your treasure
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.600]   in heaven?
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.500]   Is it like a spiritual Roth IRA
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.300]   where you maximize your reward,
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.540]   where you forego a meal to feed a homeless guy
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.880]   and then you get a bigger room in heaven?
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.080]   Is that what that means?
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:02.860]   'Cause I don't think that that's what the Bible is teaching.
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:07.740]   The reward in eternity is Christ himself.
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.500]   So Matthew 6, 19 to 21 means this for you and me.
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.300]   Eternal life has already started if you're a believer.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.980]   Know him and make him known.
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.060]   You can know him now.
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:23.260]   You can grow in your understanding of his heart now.
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.320]   Your home is in heaven,
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.240]   but while you are sojourning on earth,
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.940]   pursue first the knowledge of him.
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.040]   And don't worry about this life,
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.800]   about what you will eat or drink or what you will wear.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.180]   'Cause the pagans run after those things.
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.060]   But what will Jesus say later in Matthew 6?
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.560]   But you seek first what?
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.620]   His kingdom and his righteousness.
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.740]   And do you not think your faithful bridegroom
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.640]   will take care of every single thing that you need?
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.500]   The Christian identity is as an alien,
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.980]   a stranger, a sojourner, an exile.
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.940]   The Christian inheritance is Christ himself.
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.580]   Then what is the Christian itinerary?
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.420]   So during this engagement period of our lives,
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.900]   during the period of our sojourn,
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.860]   where we are both ambassadors of the creator of the universe
[00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.540]   as well as his bride, what are we supposed to do?
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.080]   How are we supposed to live?
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.980]   What are we to expect?
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:21.340]   What kind of attitude and posture ought we to have?
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.140]   And I'm gonna read verse two
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.500]   and verse six through nine of 1 Peter for you.
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:30.060]   Who are chosen according to the foreknowledge of God,
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.580]   the father, by the sanctifying work of the spirit
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.940]   to obey Jesus Christ, be sprinkled with his blood,
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.380]   may grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.260]   In this you greatly rejoice,
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.720]   even though now for a little while, if necessary,
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.740]   you've been distressed by various trials
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.000]   so that the proof of your faith,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.600]   being more precious than gold, which is perishable,
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.280]   even though tested by fire,
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.600]   may be found to result in praise and glory
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.340]   and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.840]   And though you have not seen him, you love him.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.120]   And though you do not see him now, but believe in him,
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:05.320]   you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.480]   and full of glory, obtaining as the outcome of your faith,
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.960]   the salvation of your souls.
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.040]   Well, first of all, we learn part of our itinerary
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.360]   is to obey.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.560]   We are called to obedience as we see in verse two.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.500]   He saved us to be our Lord.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.840]   John 14, 15, if you love me, you will keep my commandments.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.820]   And those are Jesus's words.
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.080]   So we are called to obey.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.880]   Jesus is not just savior and bridegroom.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.080]   He is also King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.480]   So it's implied here in 1 Peter,
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.680]   but commanded elsewhere that you and I are to be joyful,
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.480]   greatly joyful.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.400]   Be homesick joyfully.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.820]   So these strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia,
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:53.560]   Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia were commended
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:58.560]   for greatly rejoicing, twice in this little section.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.200]   And this joy is just beyond words.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.340]   It's inexpressible and full of glory.
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.960]   And to fully appreciate this,
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.380]   you need to understand the context
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.840]   in which 1 Peter was written.
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:14.520]   The Christians in this time period, in this area,
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.020]   were both hated and misunderstood.
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.000]   And those two things often go hand in hand,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.340]   hated and misunderstood.
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:24.260]   Animosity towards Christians was brewing.
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:27.340]   The general populace, which was mostly polytheistic,
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:30.260]   did not appreciate or agree with the Christians
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.080]   who would worship none but Christ.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.940]   So the polytheistic world, they didn't appreciate.
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.280]   In fact, they were greatly offended
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.940]   when the Christian would say
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:42.140]   that there is only one God,
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.500]   he is the only way,
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.900]   and that all other gods were powerless, worthless,
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.340]   and were not gods at all.
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.740]   This strange Christian religion
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:55.380]   was extremely countercultural and very misunderstood.
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.640]   And those on the outside had a lot of false assumptions
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.080]   about these followers of the way.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.500]   So outsiders would whisper,
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.980]   you know, I think these Christians are cannibals
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.860]   because when they get together
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:11.620]   and have their religious rituals,
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:14.900]   they eat of someone's flesh and drink of someone's blood.
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.820]   So Christians were weird
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.300]   because in their secret gatherings,
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.180]   they practice these things.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.580]   And because they also practiced Philadelphia,
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.460]   which is brotherly love,
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.800]   some thought, hey, perhaps they're engaging
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.540]   in sexual rituals of the homosexual variety
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.060]   because they're practicing brotherly love.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:38.380]   So there's all of these weird assumptions made
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.860]   by those on the outside.
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:44.460]   So it was easy to hate on these Christians.
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:47.700]   The word Christian actually means little Christ, right?
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.200]   It was actually a term of mockery and scorn.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.860]   The Christians call themselves followers of the way,
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:56.840]   but the world called them little Christs.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.620]   And we are called Christians
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:03.420]   and just know that the origin is one of derision.
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:04.780]   And history tells us that this time,
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.340]   Christians were thrown to wild beasts
[00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:10.380]   encased in hot wax, burned at the stake.
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:13.580]   It is said that Nero lit his gardens with human light poles.
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:15.980]   So he would take Christians,
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.260]   put them on a stake of wood, set it on fire,
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.420]   and his garden would be lit.
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.700]   So the Christians were an easy target
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.460]   and Nero often used them as scapegoats.
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.340]   And it's believed that both Peter and Paul later
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:32.060]   were martyred under Nero's persecution.
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:37.060]   So Peter makes reference to the brewing tribulation
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.980]   and suffering that they will be facing.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.860]   1 Peter 1, 6-7, "Even though now for a little while,
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:46.080]   "if necessary, you've been distressed by various trials.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.180]   "So that the proof of your faith
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.420]   "be more precious than gold, which is perishable,
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.260]   "even though tested by fire."
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:55.000]   1 Peter 4, 12, "Beloved, do not be surprised
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.580]   "at the fiery ordeal among you,
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.080]   "which comes upon you for your testing,
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.740]   "as though something strange were happening to you."
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.360]   "You and I should not be surprised
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.720]   "by persecution, suffering, and ostracism.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.220]   "This is to be expected."
[00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:10.520]   We see in passages like 2 Timothy 3, 12,
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:13.360]   and even Jesus' own words here in Matthew 10, 24, 25,
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.780]   "A disciple is not above his master, or a teacher,
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.840]   "nor a slave above his master.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.820]   "It is enough for the disciple that he become
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:22.580]   "like his teacher, and the slave like his master.
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.500]   "If they have called the head of the house Beelzebul,
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.680]   "how much more will they malign
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.280]   "the members of the household?"
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:32.180]   So the harder you pursue Christ,
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.940]   the more you're gonna be a weirdo,
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.040]   and the more you're gonna feel like an alien,
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.320]   a stranger, a sojourner, an outsider,
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.120]   the more you draw near to Christ,
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.980]   because the dark hates the light.
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:46.360]   Our problem here in Orange County is perhaps
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.920]   due to the fact that there is pressure
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.500]   to assimilate and root down,
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.820]   to invest our treasures here.
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:59.520]   So that it's almost, it's tricky business
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.160]   for the world to actually pick out who's a Christian.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.600]   Modern day Christians are blending in a little bit too well.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:13.880]   And as we blend in well, we lose sight of our purpose,
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.280]   our Christian itinerary.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:20.300]   First Peter 2, 11 to 12, we're not called to blend in.
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:23.200]   "Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.020]   "to abstain from fleshly lusts
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.760]   "which wage war against the soul.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.500]   "Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles,
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.920]   "so that in the thing which they slander you as evil doers,
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.000]   "they may because of your good deeds as they observe them,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   "glorify God in the day of visitation."
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.060]   So it's okay to be homesick.
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:45.840]   In fact, Christmas should cause our hearts
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.300]   to be overwhelmed with homesickness.
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:54.640]   But while we wait for home, we are to do so with a purpose,
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.260]   and that's part of our Christian itinerary.
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:01.240]   You know, one of the things that turned our one year
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.560]   in China to three years, and then our three years
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.800]   was an indefinite, and then we were just planning
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.600]   to be out in Asia just the whole time,
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.520]   and then we went to Korea.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.600]   It was hard, every holiday season was hard,
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.480]   but the thing that kept us joyfully there
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.520]   was the calling and the purpose.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.000]   We knew why we were there.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.160]   So while we were far away from loved ones, family, friends,
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.480]   customs, and football, and Mexican food, and sushi,
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:28.200]   and all of this stuff, we knew why we were there.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.520]   Being in China was not easy,
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.800]   but we lived there mindful of our purpose.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.140]   We would have loved to have been home,
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.200]   but we were commissioned to China.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.140]   We were sent there with a task.
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.140]   The harvest was and still is plentiful.
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:50.940]   So when the purpose of a mission or a mission is clear,
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:56.520]   the sojourn is easier, despite the homesickness.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.680]   If you and I would regularly remind ourselves
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.560]   of our primary purpose for living this life,
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.880]   I think we could stay constantly joyful,
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:08.960]   despite whatever it is that is going on emotionally.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:12.140]   So what is a Christian itinerary in short?
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:13.600]   First, to obey and be holy.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.880]   Second, to rejoice, even in the midst
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.520]   of severe trials and sufferings.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:22.520]   And third, to witness well, to help the homeless to glory,
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.600]   so that even the unbelieving Gentiles
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.700]   will give glory to God through you.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.920]   Our identity is in Christ.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.360]   Our inheritance is Christ.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.840]   And our purpose in this life is to proclaim
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.400]   the excellencies of Christ.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.540]   And while we are here as spiritual expats
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.360]   and spiritual sojourners, we may be homesick,
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:49.560]   but be joyfully homesick, is the call of Peter.
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:54.700]   In both our time in China and Korea,
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:57.400]   we did make a bunch of expat friends.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.680]   So on Thanksgiving, with the exception of the one
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.120]   where Becky and I went to Costco, got our rotisserie chicken,
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.600]   for Thanksgiving, we would gather around
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:11.600]   our American friends, and we would have turkey
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.960]   from the army base, and then we would have
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.340]   like random Asian foods as well,
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.960]   but it was Thanksgiving for us.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.940]   For the rest of Korea, the rest of China, it was Thursday.
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.440]   But for us, gathering together did relieve
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.080]   some of the homesickness.
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.000]   Even though it wasn't fully home,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.200]   we still found comfort in surrounding ourselves
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.060]   with people who were all longing for the same thing.
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:38.360]   I find a similar thought in Hebrews 10, 23 to 25.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:42.200]   Elder Philip preached some on this passage last week
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.060]   where he spoke of the importance of the assembly together.
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.040]   "Let us hold fast the confession of our hope
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:51.340]   "without wavering, for he who promised is faithful.
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.320]   "And let us consider how to stimulate one another
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.200]   "to loving good deeds, not forsaking
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.420]   "our own assembly together, as is the habit of some,
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.580]   "but encouraging one another, and all the more
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.800]   "as you see the day drawing near."
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.640]   So what is the exhortation?
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:10.300]   As home for you and me gets closer,
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:14.880]   we ought to assemble together more often
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.180]   for the sake of encouragement and edification.
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:21.520]   You need the church.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:25.800]   All the verbs up there in Hebrews, it's all in the plural.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.480]   No man is an island, no sojourner is an island,
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:34.480]   no alien can survive in a foreign place all by himself.
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:43.120]   Help each other in the midst of the homesickness.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:45.880]   One of the things about the expat life
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.380]   is that you get used to a revolving door.
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:52.040]   Friends travel in, friends travel out.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.320]   And this happened for us both in Beijing and Korea.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.040]   People came and stayed, people left
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.080]   after their stints were done.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.600]   And we did the same, and we had a goodbye tour
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.240]   when we left both China and Korea.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.360]   And whenever someone goes back to their home country,
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.560]   those of us who are left behind,
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.200]   obviously there's a little bit of a sadness,
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.040]   there's a little bit of a jealousy,
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.920]   but 99 out of 100 times, you're actually very happy
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.220]   for the person going home.
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.200]   And I believe that that's how it's supposed to be
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.920]   spiritually for us as well.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.960]   On a few Fridays ago, November 15th,
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.460]   Becky's grandfather passed away at age 89.
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:35.040]   I had just visited with him a few days before that,
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.100]   but on Friday I got a phone call saying
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.640]   that it didn't look like he had much time.
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.720]   So I packed my stuff, rushed to the nursing home
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.880]   where he was staying to say my final goodbyes
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.400]   and to take the kids so that Becky
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.760]   could be there for her mom.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:52.720]   Becky's grandfather had been a pastor and a believer
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.240]   who had spent much of his pastorate
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.480]   ministering to orphans and widows.
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.560]   My father-in-law is actually one of his,
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.240]   those he ministered to, and then eventually
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.920]   he married the grandfather's daughter.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.480]   So as he was just kind of struggling to breathe,
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:12.480]   I held his hand, I knelt beside his bed,
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.600]   and I just, I prayed,
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:19.520]   "God, thank you for this man's life.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.960]   "The family is going to be grieving very soon.
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:28.160]   "There's gonna be tears in Korea,
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.720]   "there are gonna be tears in Canada,
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.120]   "and just in different parts of the States.
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.560]   "There is gonna be grief.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:39.100]   "But help every single one of us
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.280]   "to be so filled with jealousy for this man,
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.680]   "what he's gonna see.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:51.260]   "Help us to be jealous to one day experience
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.180]   "that as well for us."
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:58.040]   And this isn't because I have like spiritual super sense.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.680]   The day before our pastors, we went to a conference
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.440]   and Alistair Begg, some of you guys hear him on the radio,
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.160]   he actually was preaching on prayer.
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.880]   So it wasn't so much about death and stuff,
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.800]   but he said something about prayer as a side comment
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.600]   that's just kind of stuck with me.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:16.520]   He said, "The people in our churches
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.680]   "spend so much more time praying
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.400]   "to keep the saints out of heaven
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:24.580]   "than they do praying to rescue sinners out of hell."
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:26.620]   And I thought that was so profound.
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:27.900]   And if you look at our prayer requests,
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.860]   it's filled with prayer requests to extend people's lives.
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:33.540]   So to delay the great wedding.
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.540]   If someone's sick, oh no, please pray
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.340]   that God will heal them.
[00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.320]   And it is commanded in scripture.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:46.440]   But we pray with such urgency when someone we love is sick.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:49.260]   But when the multitudes and the hordes
[00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:54.260]   are destined for hell, we don't really give a thought.
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:58.780]   So when he said that, it just left an indelible impression
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:39:59.980]   on my heart and my mind.
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:04.120]   This is not my home.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.660]   My time is short.
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.700]   I don't know when I'm going to go.
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.400]   I don't know when you're gonna go.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.780]   But when he calls me, I go.
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:19.020]   I'm 41, so I'm hoping I have a little bit more time
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:19.940]   with my kids.
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.220]   But when he calls, I go.
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:28.340]   The greater obsession while I'm here,
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:31.780]   homesick, ought to be the purpose
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:34.220]   to which I've been called, my itinerary,
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:37.580]   to bring others to this living hope.
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:42.760]   Jesus promised in John 10, 16, he says,
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:46.220]   "I have other sheep who are not of this fold.
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:49.080]   "I must bring them also.
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:53.600]   "They will hear my voice, and they will become one flock
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.180]   "with one shepherd."
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.820]   He has other sheep.
[00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:06.300]   He has other sheep who are yet not of the fold.
[00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:11.620]   And in this holiday season,
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.260]   home should be on our hearts,
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:19.700]   and to bring many, many, many people
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:25.740]   to this living hope that we profess to have.
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:30.140]   As we eagerly wait for home,
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.140]   let's point others to the good shepherd.
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:36.020]   You're gonna hear a lot of Jesus sung.
[00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.740]   You're gonna hear a lot of Bethlehem.
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.100]   You're gonna hear of all kinds of stuff,
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.420]   and some stuff that has nothing to do with Jesus.
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:45.340]   There's trees, and Christmases, and eggnog, and stuff,
[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:50.340]   but whenever there is a Jesus that is sung about,
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:51.880]   there you have an opportunity
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:57.000]   to help others to understand that they too can go home.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.680]   So in this Christmas season,
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:07.460]   be homesick, but joyfully so.
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:10.380]   And that's the call of the Christian,
[00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:15.380]   especially in times like this.
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:20.980]   We're gonna take some time to pray together.
[00:42:20.980 --> 00:42:22.780]   So the question I have for you
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:26.540]   that I want you to pray about is how eager are you for home?
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:33.900]   How eager are you to be united to the bridegroom
[00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.380]   on the great wedding day,
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:39.480]   or are you content to just be engaged forever?
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.240]   Let's pray.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:44.080]   Take some time to reflect
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:48.040]   and give thanks to the God who has called us to know him.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:52.200]   us to know Him.
