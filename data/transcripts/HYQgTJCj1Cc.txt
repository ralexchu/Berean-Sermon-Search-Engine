[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.320]   Well, we'll begin now.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.180]   And so just a reminder as we're doing,
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.560]   as we're going back into praise and prayer for tonight,
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.400]   there are gonna be white chairs up here.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.480]   After the beginning portion,
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.420]   we're going to be clearing the white chairs out
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.760]   for anybody who would want to come forward
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.800]   and pray up here on the ground.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.880]   For anyone else that would not want to,
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.760]   you can sit in those brown chairs
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.520]   and scatter yourself and feel comfortable
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.920]   to just go around the church, the sanctuary area,
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.300]   to find some place where you can concentrate
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.300]   and meditate and pray before God.
[00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.440]   And so same as last time,
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.280]   we are going to be starting with some praise,
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.740]   and then I'll be coming up to give a portion of the word,
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.160]   and then we'll be spending a big chunk of time together
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.400]   just praying, okay?
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.320]   All right, so I'll open us up in prayer.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.880]   Would you close your eyes and bow your heads with me?
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:02.920]   Heavenly Father, God, we again want to remember
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.600]   that when we come to you in prayer,
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.440]   Father, we approach the God of all gods,
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.560]   the Lord of all lords,
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.340]   the one who created the world with his very voice.
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.920]   Father, you are the Holy One.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.280]   God, you are the unapproachable one.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.200]   And Father, you beckon us to come near,
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.320]   and we have the ability to do so by the blood of your Son,
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.720]   by his grace, but God, I pray that we will never
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.200]   take it so flippantly that we would have a healthy fear
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.680]   in us recognizing who it is that we speak to.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:45.000]   And Father, I pray that in that there would be so much joy
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.180]   in knowing that you, our God, are also our Father.
[00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:53.260]   I pray, God, that the words that we pray tonight
[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.220]   would be genuine and authentic from our hearts.
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.380]   Would you cause us, Lord, in the places where we have yet
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.060]   to release control, to remind us that prayer is
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.660]   for your kingdom and will, that before anything else,
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.540]   that we would come ready to give of ourselves
[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.900]   all that which we are, Lord, so that your kingdom would come.
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.380]   So Lord, thank you that we could gather tonight to do this.
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.820]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:28.340]   - Let's spend a few moments just praying on our own
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.800]   as we prepare for tonight.

[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:43.860]   and forget not all He's done.
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:55.540]   He forgives all your iniquities and He heals all your
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:21:05.460]   infirmities. He redeems your life from the pit,
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.940]   crowns you with mercy.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.300]   [Music]
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:20.980]   And as far as the east is from the west,
[00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:27.780]   so far have you taken our sins from us.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:35.460]   And as high as the heavens are over the earth,
[00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:45.780]   so great is your steadfast love toward us.
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:55.780]   [Music]
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:04.580]   Bless the Lord, bless the Lord, oh my soul
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:11.380]   and all that's within me, praise Him.
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:18.660]   Bless the Lord, oh my soul
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:25.780]   and forget not who He is.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:33.620]   As a father shows compassion
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:46.980]   to his beloved children, so the Lord shows compassion to us,
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:52.580]   to those who fear Him.
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:23:02.660]   And as far as the east is from the west,
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:09.620]   so far have you taken our sins from us.
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:17.220]   And as high as the heavens are over the earth,
[00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:22.260]   so great is your steadfast love.
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:31.780]   And as far, as far as the east is from the west,
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:38.660]   so far have you taken our sins from us.
[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:46.340]   And as high as the heavens are over the earth,
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:56.660]   so great is your steadfast love toward us.
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:10.660]   [Music]
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:14.660]   Amen. You may be seated.
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:25.460]   All right, well we've been trying to have these praise and prayers about
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:29.300]   once a month, once a month or so, and it's been three years running now as
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:33.620]   we've been on this theme of prayer. So if you are new
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.060]   and you see this theme, we've actually been kind of
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:40.900]   honing in on this topic of prayer. And the reason why we decided to do that is
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:45.780]   because we see it as as a great weak point. And
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:49.620]   I don't think too many of us would disagree with with that.
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:53.540]   And one thing I've noticed as we've had these praise and prayers
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:58.180]   is that, especially when we first started doing this, I saw a great
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:03.700]   disconnect in my own life in certain places where here the mood
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.820]   is kind of right for it, you know. We're singing
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:11.940]   songs, we're all together, we're praying. It's a designated time of
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:15.940]   prayer. Like when in your life do you designate an hour, an hour and a half of
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:19.460]   time just to just sit there and praise and
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:22.420]   pray to God? It's quite difficult to come across
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:28.100]   sometimes. And so while this was a very privileged and blessed time where we can
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.620]   pray together, there was also a growing disconnect
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.740]   between just personal prayer time and something
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.580]   like this. And so therein lies a great danger where
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:42.900]   we might see that how we pray here
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:50.180]   and how we pray alone can feel different.
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:56.340]   And when I first started thinking about that, I was wondering how do you
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:00.740]   bridge those two things? Like do you try to recreate something? Well, we're not
[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:05.460]   we're not together. We don't have just this much time all the time. And
[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:09.300]   I was thinking through my mind of how you do this and
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:14.100]   why is my heart so fickle? Do you do this every day? Are we called to have
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:18.340]   a time of prayerful, heartfelt, intentional time with the Lord? And does
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.380]   it always need to look and feel a certain way? And I
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:25.780]   wrestled through these things, I remember last year as I was
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:32.900]   wondering about the state of my heart. And what I realized is my heart is
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:37.540]   always in a different place. My heart is always changing. And my
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.580]   heart can be up in the mountains sometimes and sometimes it's deep down
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.580]   in the pits. But what prayer is, it brings you to a
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:49.540]   God who doesn't change. It brings you to a rock, an
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:54.420]   unchanging God who through everything remains still
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:27:02.020]   and perfectly who he is. And so it's not a matter of me
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.700]   wringing my heart to get it to a certain place, it's a matter of me
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:10.340]   coming before God and seeing who he is and
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:14.980]   response happening. Now I kept battling with that
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:18.420]   and as I was trying to, okay so if I want to try to see God, if I want to
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.540]   behold him and I want to change because I'm coming
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:26.100]   into his presence, I'm seeing in fact who he is,
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:31.060]   that unless my heart was in a place where I was ready,
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:37.620]   where my heart was surrendered, where I was actually coming before God,
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:41.620]   that I couldn't see him clearly unless my hands were empty. That's what I
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:47.940]   realized about my own heart. And so day by day by day as I was
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.820]   wrestling with it,
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:58.180]   it required a life that was consistently and regularly surrendered,
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:03.140]   examining personal life and heart and decisions and emotions
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:06.820]   to see if there are places of compromise because
[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.940]   those are the very things that would keep me from him
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:17.540]   and heartfelt prayer. Tonight I wanted to bring up
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:22.740]   something that really helped me. It comes from Matthew chapter 24.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.540]   I'm going to read this for us. We're going to go into three different
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:28.980]   portions of it and then I'll talk us through it just for a
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:35.220]   bit. Matthew 24 verse 36 says, "But of that day and hour no one knows,
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:39.140]   not even the angels of heaven nor the son but the father alone.
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.660]   For the coming of the son of man will be just like the days of Noah.
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:46.260]   For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:50.260]   and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered the ark. And they did
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.540]   not understand until the flood came and took them all away.
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:56.740]   So will the coming of the son of man be. Then
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.500]   there will be two men in the field. One will be taken away, taken and one will be
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.980]   left. Two women will be grinding at the mill.
[00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.220]   One will be taken and one will be left." And so this is talking about a future
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:10.740]   time when Jesus is one day going to return.
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.340]   That our Lord, that our Savior, he is going to come back
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.980]   and he's going to complete what he started.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:23.220]   The first time he came back he came in grace, he came in mercy, he came as a
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:27.460]   suffering servant, he came to give his life and to die on a cross to
[00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.660]   serve and not be served.
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:36.900]   So the first question I wanted to ask as we look at this passage though,
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.500]   when he says, "But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.340]   but the father alone," he says, "the coming of the son of man will be just like the
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:49.300]   days of Noah." Do we believe that he's coming back?
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:54.420]   That's very important because the answer is very easy for us to turn and say to
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:58.900]   our neighbor that that's what we believe wholeheartedly.
[00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:03.060]   But the state of our surrender and the place of our compromised hearts actually
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.980]   betrays us. Our heart will constantly and
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:11.940]   consistently show us what it is that we actually believe.
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.300]   And so that question of whether we believe Jesus is coming back or not and
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:20.420]   he is coming at a time we won't know, do we believe that is something we have
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:25.700]   to wrestle with. And so we have to take take a moment and
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:29.300]   pause and to look at our hearts before we do
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:34.900]   any kind of praying to God and look and see do we believe that we
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:40.100]   actually want God's kingdom to come and God's will to be done.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.140]   Because without a question, without a shadow of a doubt,
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:50.260]   God's kingdom and God's will is Jesus's return.
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:54.100]   Everything is aiming, everything is beelining and intentioned,
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:58.580]   just as when Jesus at a certain point in his ministry turns and just beelines
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:00.740]   towards Jerusalem to the cross because he knows
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:05.540]   that this was his intention and purpose. That God's intention and purpose,
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:09.620]   everything he's doing is funneling to this end.
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:16.980]   So how can we pray, "God your kingdom come, your will be done" when our lives are
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:20.900]   betraying the fact that we don't think Jesus is actually
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.300]   coming.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:27.620]   Because if we actually live like that, how would our lives today
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:35.460]   look? What things might change? How would our decisions be changed?
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:40.260]   And that right there is a place of compromise. That right there is a place
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:46.260]   where we must surrender. The places that we say that we believe
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:51.460]   is not connecting with our actual decisions and our lives.
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:57.060]   The demand upon us where we say, "Your kingdom come, your will be done." If our
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.980]   lives, if we're not prone to that, then it's an
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:05.540]   impossible task to pray to God, "Your kingdom come, your will be done."
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:09.460]   It is always going to be self-centered.
[00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:13.460]   And in that we will always come with a sense of guilt because we know
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:18.340]   that even when we come month to month, that our lives have not been reflecting
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:23.460]   what we believe. That our prayers have not been
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:27.300]   like what we might experience when we're all together
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:31.540]   or when we're in front of people. Now that doesn't
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:36.180]   negate the need for this. These are places of reminder for us to come
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:41.540]   together to say, "This is what we're intentioned to do. This is what we're
[00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.980]   going to be convicted upon."
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:49.460]   But look at what it says, "For the coming of the Son of Man will be just
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.420]   like the days of Noah. For as in those days before the flood, they were eating,
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.860]   drinking, marrying, giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered the ark."
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:33:02.100]   Do our lives, do we look more like Noah or do we look more like
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.660]   the world?
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:14.020]   Eating, drinking, marrying, enjoying our lives.
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:19.220]   Which person do we look like? The man of faith
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.420]   or the faithless ones?
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:29.460]   We have to take stock today of what's been captivating our attention.
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.940]   I remember when I first became a Christian, somebody
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:37.300]   taught me in prayer one of the things that's helpful
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.620]   sometimes is to pray backwards. He asked me,
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.220]   "How do you end your prayer?" I said, "Well, I end my prayers by saying in Jesus' name
[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:48.500]   I pray, amen." He said, "Try praying that to begin with."
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:53.300]   Jesus said, "All these things I'm about to pray, I want to pray in your
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:58.180]   name. I want to pray it as if this is what
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:00.980]   you would want.
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:06.100]   That I can't have a prayer filled with everything that my heart desires
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:10.500]   apart from you and just sign your name off at the end and say that I am allowed
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.140]   to approach the throne of grace with confidence, to
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:18.740]   meet a God who wants to give grace and mercy in times of need."
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:22.820]   Because before we are able to do that, we need to remember who it is that we're
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:26.740]   approaching. And that is true to anyone. Yes, he is our
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:29.860]   father, but that is true to my kids. My kids know I
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.660]   love them. My kids know that I love them with all my
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:36.420]   heart and I will do anything and I will lay down my life for them. My kids
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.980]   know that.
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:42.900]   But it's such an interesting thing. Every day they come and run and
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:46.500]   when they hear the garage door open to come and run and give me a hug and
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.820]   all these kinds of things, but there are times
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.860]   where they do not want to come into my presence. You know why?
[00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:58.020]   I think you know why. Because they got in trouble from mommy that day.
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:01.460]   Because they know they did something wrong and in that place they're dragging
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.900]   their feet to come to me. They're afraid to make eye contact with me and
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:08.900]   I am here to say that that is appropriate.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.820]   It doesn't change the fact that I care for them and I love them. It doesn't
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.940]   change the fact that I want what is best for them, but there is something here
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:20.420]   that needs to be addressed. And there will be no peace, there will be
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.540]   no comfort until we get to that place. It's just simply
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.540]   the reality of relationship.
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:31.300]   How can we come before God and say, "Your kingdom come, your will be done when our
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:35.380]   lives have lived." However it is that we want our kingdoms
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.660]   to look like. That we've been wanting our wills to be
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.300]   accomplished.
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:46.580]   So our prayers need to reflect that. Matthew 24 continues by saying in verse
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:49.300]   42, "Therefore be on the alert for you do not
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.500]   know which day your Lord is coming. But be sure of this that if the head of the
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.460]   house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming,
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:58.820]   he would have been on the alert and would not have allowed his house to be
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:02.020]   broken into. For this reason you also must be ready.
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:07.220]   For the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you do not think he will."
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:12.500]   We have to be constantly readying ourselves.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:19.860]   Do you know what God's will is? Do you know what God's kingdom is?
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:23.940]   Have we been living to that? Then we have to consistently
[00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:28.740]   and regularly ready our hearts and put ourselves into a place
[00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:35.540]   where we can actually pray the way Jesus instructed us to begin our prayers.
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:41.060]   That as we look up to our Father in heaven, as we look up to the Holy One
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:45.540]   who is utterly unique and set apart from us,
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.900]   that it is his kingdom and his will that we want accomplished
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.100]   in our lives. And we need to be able to say that
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:57.220]   without a drifting heart. We need to be able to say that
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:04.420]   without any kind of inauthentic, ingenuine
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:08.660]   type of heart inside of us. Now this doesn't mean we need to be perfect, but
[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:14.260]   this does mean there needs to be a sense of desperation and urgency in us.
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:19.220]   That although we might not be talking about personal perfection,
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:24.180]   we're talking about if we see that our paths are not aligned with God,
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:28.260]   then there is an urgency in us. The very first thing we must pray,
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:32.420]   if it is God's kingdom that we're caring for, before we can get to any prayer
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:36.580]   about anybody else or any other thing, is to make sure that we pray before God
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:42.020]   in repentant prayer. To make our relationship right with him.
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:45.780]   So that we can look him in the eyes. So that we can say
[00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:51.540]   with the heart that really desires God, "Now I can pray these things."
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:55.460]   "I want your kingdom and your will to be done."
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:38:01.460]   Continues in Matthew 24 45, "Who then is the faithful and sensible slave,
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:04.260]   whom his master put in charge of his household to give them their food at the
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:06.980]   proper time? Blessed is that slave whom his master
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:10.420]   finds so doing when he comes. Truly I say to you that he will put him in
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:13.860]   charge of all his possessions. But if that evil slave says in his heart,
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:18.260]   'My master is not coming for a long time,' and begins to beat his fellow slaves and
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:21.460]   eat and drink with drunkards, the master of that slave will come on a
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:25.140]   day when he does not expect him, and at an hour which he does not know,
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.260]   and will cut him in pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites. In that
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:32.500]   place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:37.460]   It's a startling passage because there are two different types of servants.
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:44.740]   The reality is this is the master. The reality is God is God. And two people
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:49.940]   can both proclaim the same truth that God is God. But the difference is there
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:53.060]   is one who is able to say, "He is my master." And
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.940]   there is one who knows and recognizes and able to
[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.780]   distinguish with his lips that he is indeed the master. He is
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:08.020]   indeed God. But he is not his God. He lives however he wants to.
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:14.180]   He looks and he's like, "Oh, he's not coming. Oh, it's not the way I thought."
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:17.700]   He's not just being self-aware and like doing things because he knows
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:24.180]   he's being watched. His heart has not been captivated, drawn
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:27.860]   to this master he loves and serves.
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:34.420]   There are two types of servants, faithful and sensible ones.
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:38.980]   And then there are ones that this, in this passage, Jesus calls
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:45.140]   evil. And they both proclaim to follow God.
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:51.940]   And so even with us we can pray and we can have the right theology.
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:40:00.020]   But what will betray us is our lives. It's our heart.
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:06.740]   So tonight is a night not to be hanging our heads because of that. Tonight is a
[00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:11.540]   night to remember that our desire,
[00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:17.620]   if we really want what God wants in the lives of our unbelieving friends,
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:24.340]   in this church, in whoever it is that we're praying for,
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:30.420]   that we need to be the first one to step up and offer our lives as sacrifices to
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.660]   God.
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:37.620]   And there cannot be any place of compromise in us.
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:43.220]   And to pray that because he is in fact our master.
[00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:53.380]   I want us to remember tonight that we have a mission to do here.
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:57.140]   The reason why we do communion, we're going to do communion in a couple weeks.
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:01.540]   The reason why we do communion is to remember back at what Jesus did,
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:06.100]   but there's a second part to it, is to continue to do so until the day he
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:11.380]   returns. We're waiting. We're not setting up shop
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:17.140]   here. We're waiting for our true Christ, our true home, our true heaven. Not the
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:20.580]   fake ones that we set up here. We're waiting for that.
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:24.340]   So we in fact have a mission statement.
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:30.340]   That we have one goal here. That our will, our desires need to
[00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:36.340]   align with God in the very same way. That he desires for all things to be
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:41.060]   saved. He desires for all of the world to come
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:49.060]   into wholeness and peace. And that it is through his judgment
[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:56.500]   that this will occur. And in all of that, that we need to see that our prayers
[00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:00.420]   are going to be very much compromised. Very much.
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:04.420]   We're going to feel the inability to muster up any kind of
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:09.940]   desperation and urgency until we are ready to lay it all down.
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:16.180]   So the format is going to be the same. We're going to have prayer requests up
[00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:18.900]   here. And these prayer requests, you don't have
[00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:22.340]   to pray through it. First, I would really encourage you to
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.780]   pray for your own heart. And to examine your heart. And to go into
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:29.700]   a deep time of prayer. Seeing where it is that you might be
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:34.740]   holding on to things. And tonight would be the time to let it go.
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:38.740]   Not just think about how we've been living unfaithfully, but
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:44.740]   to come to a place where we say, "God, I want to be faithful to you."
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:48.900]   And to pray an introspective prayer. And so there are going to be
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:52.420]   three different slides up here though. That if you
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:56.100]   don't have anything to pray for, so please don't feel obligated
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:00.340]   to this. Don't feel shackled to these three PowerPoint slides.
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:04.100]   If there are things that God has put on your heart to pray for,
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:07.380]   please pray for that. These are going to be here for you to
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:11.780]   for a help and an aid if you need it. We're going to be giving you about 20
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:14.980]   minutes of unhindered prayer where there's going
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:17.940]   to be some music. And again, the same thing. We're going to
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:22.100]   be asking you also to feel free to move around. To go find
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:25.300]   a place. We're going to be moving the white chairs again. And
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:28.660]   there are little strips of carpet here. And that's just there if
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.940]   if you wanted to sit and to kneel or whatever it is. But
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:35.780]   make this a time where you can actually engage with the Lord.
[00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:40.260]   And to come before him. And not just flippantly say like, "Oh I know the
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:44.020]   theology of God's grace and I could come and he hears and he's my father and he's
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:47.140]   he's going to do all things to the good of those who love him." But
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:51.220]   but today to actually come before him. To actually look up at him.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:56.260]   And to actually surrender. And to actually then pray.
[00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:59.620]   And so after about 20 minutes I'll be coming back up here.
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:03.300]   And we'll the elders will be up here. And that's going to be a time also
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:08.100]   if you are in need of prayer to come up and to receive prayer from the elders.
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:11.620]   And you may also use that time to pray for one another.
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:14.740]   To move around. If there's somebody you need to pray with. If there's someone
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:18.020]   that you've been walking with. You've been praying for them. You can go
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.900]   and pray for them. And so we're going to be cutting it up
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:25.860]   into those two portions. Okay. So let me just pray for us here.
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:29.460]   And then we'll go into a time of personal prayer for about 20 minutes.
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:35.860]   Heavenly Father I pray God that as you instructed us to.
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:39.860]   God that we would pray your kingdom come and your will be done.
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:44.260]   And Father before anything else. Before anything else our hearts could come up
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:47.700]   with to pray for. We know that it is our heart itself that needs
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:51.540]   to be changed. And so Father I pray that you would help
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:54.660]   us. Help us God to be able to draw near to
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:58.260]   you. And Father to come in true repentance so
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:04.260]   that we can actually draw near to you in confidence. In Jesus name I pray. Amen.
[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:18.260]   So we're gonna move. Sorry. We're gonna move the chairs first and then we'll pray.
[00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:22.260]   [Praying]
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:26.260]   [Praying]
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:30.260]   [Praying]
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:35.260]   [Praying]
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:43.260]   [Praying]
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:51.260]   [Praying]
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:55.260]   [Praying]
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:46:01.260]   [Praying]
[00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:08.260]   [Praying]
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:20.260]   [Praying]
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:24.260]   [Praying]
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:37.260]   [Praying]
[00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:51.260]   [Praying]
[00:46:51.260 --> 00:47:05.260]   [Praying]
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:09.260]   [Praying]
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:23.260]   [Praying]
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:27.260]   [Praying]
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:42.260]   [Praying]
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.260]   [Praying]
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:59.260]   [Praying]
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:03.260]   [Praying]
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:12.260]   [Praying]

[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:26.260]   [Praying]

[01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:34.260]   Okay, so afterwards we're going to be putting the chairs back, so if you could stick around and help us a little bit with that, that would be appreciated.
[01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:36.260]   Let me close this night in prayer.
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:46.260]   Oh Father, God, we come to you very grateful, and we pray, God, that there would always be a good fruit that is produced from times of prayer.
[01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:57.260]   Oh Father, we pray that you would cause us, Lord, to long for the coming of your Son, and Lord, that we would live lives that reflect that.
[01:28:57.260 --> 01:29:03.260]   God, I pray that all the things that we prayed for tonight, we would continue to pray for in urgency and desperation.
[01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:06.260]   That over and over again we would approach that throne of grace.
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:09.260]   And God, thank you that you listen to us.
[01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:12.260]   Father, we give you glory, honor, and praise.
[01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:14.260]   There is none like you, and we love you.
[01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:15.260]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:16.260]   Amen.
[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:27.260]   [music]
