[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.340]   Just for the sake of those who are farther back

[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.700]   we're just going to remain seated.
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:07:00.180]   But as you get situated, let's join our hearts
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.260]   in a word of prayer.
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.500]   And then we'll get started with some songs of worship

[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.740]   Heavenly Father, we lift up to you our hearts
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.100]   of gratitude and thanks.
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.780]   God, we regularly want to acknowledge
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.420]   what a privilege it is that, God, we know you,
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.260]   that we can hear your word.
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.500]   And God, to hear just of the many blessings
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.100]   you impart to us through your son.
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.940]   Thank you, God, that we have the assurance that, Lord, you
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.940]   know us.
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.660]   And God, you're guiding us.
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.340]   And Lord, ultimately, you have granted to us all things.
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.980]   And Lord, you're leading us that we would be blameless and holy.
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.100]   Father, in this process, God, of growing together,
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.140]   would you truly bless our time invested
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.780]   into learning and sharing and cause
[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.020]   it to be fruitful in our faith, Lord.
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.500]   We also lift up to you with our hearts joined
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.100]   and our voices joined together.
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.380]   Our worship may be pleasing to you, Lord.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.660]   It's in Christ and we pray.
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.160]   Amen.

[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:58.060]   It draws me.
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:08.420]   Son of God, prophesy of the hope,

[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.900]   The first is that if you search your email for the Second Peter
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.180]   schedule, there is a shared spreadsheet
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.060]   where you can log in your name for volunteer opportunities
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:13.100]   that include everything from parking to child care
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.100]   and setup and greeting.
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.860]   We're going to send a reminder email out
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.340]   to all the participants here.
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.060]   So please make sure you take a look at that spreadsheet
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.780]   and put your name down.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.740]   If you feel like you're going to forget, just do it today
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.660]   at the end of our study.
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.860]   The second thing is that today we have a few things going on
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.580]   that need your help.
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.940]   So after the Bible study is done,
[00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.660]   typically you're in shortly after 9.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.460]   So around 9, 15, I'm going to give out a call.
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.340]   And we need help in making sure that we get ready
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.940]   for the move of our crime room.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:49.700]   So first, we need people in our previous cafe, the crime room
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.860]   now, just adjacent to us.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.460]   We're going to need help just carrying tables and chairs
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.940]   and clearing out the room.
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.540]   If some of you guys will, after the Bible study is over,
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.940]   head to the current cafe in the sanctuary side,
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.420]   we'll start grabbing chairs, moving it over.
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.980]   And we also need help--
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.620]   you know those little flip-down tables in the sanctuary?
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.100]   We're going to try to put all those back now
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.380]   that we don't have to keep setting things up and stuff
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:12.880]   like that.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.500]   So we have three distinct areas that you can just go right away
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.780]   and start helping.
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:21.540]   So you know how they say, many hands make the workload light.
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.060]   If you are available, if you guys
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.540]   don't have already pre-scheduled meet-up or something,
[00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.540]   please make sure you go and lend a hand, OK?
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.660]   For the people who are listening out on the overflow room,
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.900]   let's give them a big round.
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.340]   They're kind of toughing it out over there.
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.660]   I hope you guys hear that.
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:41.660]   Cool.
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.860]   Just remember, you too have to put away your table and chair
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.540]   after you're done.
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.140]   With that said, at this time, if you would,
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.420]   go just directly into your discussion
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.340]   from your personal inductive study,
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.460]   sharing your questions, observations.
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.580]   At 8 o'clock, we'll circle back together here
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:02.660]   for Pastor Peter's lesson on the passage say for verses 1
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:03.340]   through 4.
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.500]   Thanks, everyone.

[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:32.380]   If I can have you guys come back.
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:34.100]   I know those of you guys who are in the rooms.
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:41.340]   Going to wrap up where you guys at.
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:44.580]   You guys will have enough time to go back.
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:47.780]   So if I can ask the people in the rooms to come back out.

[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:18.780]   You'll have time to wrap up your small group afterwards.
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:23.260]   You'll have discussion time, prayer time afterwards.
[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:26.060]   So if you guys can come back and grab your seats.
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:33.060]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]

[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:05.100]   Oh, I heard-- what is that?
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:10.580]   I just had some watermelon.
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:16.380]   This is my third can.
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:17.180]   Homemade?
[01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:17.680]   Wow.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:20.680]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:43.120]   I don't want to spill it.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:43.840]   Oh, it's good.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:44.340]   Thank you.
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.340]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:50.300]   OK, it's 8 o'clock.
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.220]   So we're going to get started.
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:57.820]   All right, so my goal in doing an overview of the text
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:00.580]   is not to go through every single meaning of the text,
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:02.380]   because it'd be redundant.
[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:05.140]   I'm sure you guys already have covered it.
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:08.180]   So what I'm going to do is kind of highlight some of the things.
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:09.900]   And then if there are some verses that
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:11.940]   may be a little bit more difficult to understand,
[01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:14.060]   I may spend a little bit more time in that.
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:16.820]   So as I'm going through, my goal is
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:19.900]   to kind of show you how inductive study-- at least
[01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:22.220]   I do inductive study, and then the insights
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:23.700]   that I've gotten from that.
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.740]   And then so, again, I may not cover everything
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:28.700]   that you guys have covered.
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:29.860]   But that's not my goal.
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:31.860]   So some weeks I may, some weeks I may not.
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:34.380]   Next week's-- not next week, but the following week
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:37.660]   has a lot more verses.
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.780]   But you have two weeks to do it.
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:43.620]   So if you cram, next week is praise and prayer.
[01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:47.580]   So if you don't touch your Bible until right before Bible study,
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:50.300]   it's going to be probably too much for one week.
[01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.660]   So you're going to have to break that down into two weeks
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:53.780]   and kind of spread it out.
[01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:55.980]   Do first half one week, and then next week, and then
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:57.260]   the other half before you come.
[01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:59.660]   And then you'll be able to cover all of it.
[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:02.980]   So again, I just want to make sure that you understand that
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:06.420]   and say, hey, you didn't talk about this issue.
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:07.780]   Again, so that's not my goal.
[01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:10.980]   My goal is to kind of help you to be better students
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:13.420]   of the word yourself.
[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:14.880]   So I won't be covering everything.
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:18.780]   But as I mentioned last week, one of the first things
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:20.980]   that I do when I look at a text that
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:27.540]   helped me to break down the text is by sentence structure.
[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:31.780]   Simon Peter, obviously he's the main subject,
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:34.340]   a bond servant and apostle.
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:36.100]   I'm going to make it a little bit smaller.
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:41.420]   Can you guys see back there?
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:43.380]   If I do that, like way back there, you guys can see it?
[01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:43.880]   OK.
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:50.700]   If you squint, well, keep squinting then.
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:09:04.980]   All right.
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:09.540]   Simon Peter, a bond servant and apostle of Jesus Christ.
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:16.140]   To those who have received--
[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:18.540]   of faith-- again, there's no one way to do this.
[01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:19.860]   This is just to kind of--
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:21.660]   when you look at it, you can kind of
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:23.740]   see the sentence structure.
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:28.420]   Received a faith of the same kind as ours.
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:31.860]   You know what, I'm going to have to make this font a little bit.
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:32.740]   It's not working out.
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:33.240]   Hold on.
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:38.980]   Let me do this.
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:42.380]   [AUDIO OUT]
[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:45.680]   OK.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:54.420]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:55.500]   No, don't need to.
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:10:02.300]   I still-- I need more text on that.
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:03.300]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:04.940]   All right, let me try this again.
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:20.820]   A Simon Peter-- Simon Peter, a bond servant and apostle
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:27.860]   of Christ to those who have received a faith.
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:30.220]   What kind of faith?
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:31.860]   Of the same kind as ours.
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.460]   Right?
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:35.460]   How did you receive the same faith?
[01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:39.660]   By the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ.
[01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:42.940]   So for me, when I break down the text like that,
[01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:44.900]   it's easier for me to see the thought flow.
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:47.500]   Because you can see Simon Peter's the one speaking.
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:49.700]   He calls himself bond servant and apostle.
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:53.940]   To the people who he's talking to.
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:54.940]   Right?
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:59.620]   And then of the same faith, a same kind of ours.
[01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:02.260]   A same kind of ours.
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:06.940]   So these are all like describing each line going down.
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:08.940]   So when I break it down like this,
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:11.180]   it helps me to see, oh, this is the thought flow.
[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:13.340]   So it helps me to focus when I'm going
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:16.500]   into do the inductive Bible study, because the thoughts are
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:17.460]   separated.
[01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:20.060]   Instead of looking at it as one sentence or paragraph,
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:21.400]   because it's separated like that,
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.820]   it helps me to kind of hone in on the verses.
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:24.460]   OK?
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:28.340]   So if you keep doing this as a habit of doing that--
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:30.580]   and I know some of you guys may not do this and say,
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:31.580]   that's not helpful.
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:33.980]   I would say of all the things that I
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:38.380]   do for inductive Bible study, Bible study, sermon prep,
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:41.420]   this is probably the most helpful thing that helps me.
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:42.100]   OK?
[01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:43.700]   So if in the beginning you may think,
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:44.740]   like, oh, it's a lot of work.
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:45.620]   I don't get much out of it.
[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:46.900]   I can just do it looking at it.
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:49.500]   It's like, I would highly encourage
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:52.020]   you to persevere in that.
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:54.220]   And if you get in the habit of doing this,
[01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:55.620]   I think it will help you a lot.
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:56.140]   OK?
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:58.780]   It causes you to slow down, look at the verses,
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:00.860]   look at each line separately, instead
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:02.100]   of looking at the whole verse.
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.060]   OK?
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:06.060]   It's just like, if you memorize scripture,
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.500]   you'll memorize, but there's things
[01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:10.380]   that pop out at you when you memorize it
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:12.140]   versus when you just read it.
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:12.860]   Right?
[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:14.340]   If you've never memorized scripture before,
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:15.900]   you don't know what I'm talking about.
[01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:17.300]   But if you've memorized scripture,
[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:19.960]   you know that certain words get repeated in your head
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.380]   while you're memorizing.
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.540]   And then the verse sounds very different.
[01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.100]   Certain things get emphasized that you
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:27.460]   didn't think about when you weren't memorizing.
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:29.380]   And so it's the same way in the Bible study.
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:31.220]   If you're not in the habit of slowing down
[01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:33.580]   and just kind of read it, then you're always just kind
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:35.100]   of skimming the superficial.
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:39.660]   So this helps me to break down each verse, each word,
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:41.060]   and then helps me to focus on that.
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:41.580]   OK?
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:45.980]   So I'm going to go over this quickly.
[01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:49.100]   Grace and peace, that's the subject,
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:53.540]   be multiplied, how?
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:56.940]   In the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
[01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.220]   Right?
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:06.340]   Seeing that his divine power has granted to us everything.
[01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:12.420]   Everything pertains to life and godliness.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:13.340]   How?
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:18.660]   Through the knowledge, through the true knowledge of him
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:19.660]   and who is he?
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:23.380]   Who called us by his own glory and excellence.
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:33.500]   For by these, these meaning up there, he has granted to us--
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.340]   what did he grant us?
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:38.580]   His precious and magnificent promises.
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.260]   Why?
[01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:47.500]   So that by them you may become partakers
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:54.460]   of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:55.580]   is in the world.
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:56.080]   OK?
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.980]   I'll leave it here.
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:13.580]   All right, so doing this helps me to see the outline.
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:14.740]   And then when I--
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:17.220]   so before I do any kind of like note taking,
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:18.700]   this is the first thing I do.
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:21.100]   So whenever I look at the text, I'm looking at this page,
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:22.020]   like this.
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:22.860]   OK?
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:24.740]   And then from here, I break down.
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:28.340]   And I'm not going to go through all of it, like Simon Peter.
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.460]   And I start asking questions like,
[01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:32.940]   he calls himself bond servant and an apostle.
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.380]   Like, why does he use this title?
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:36.580]   Because in 1 Peter, he only says he's an apostle.
[01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:38.140]   What's the distinction?
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:42.860]   Another thing that's different between 1 Peter is that--
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:43.700]   oh, sorry.
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:46.740]   He uses Simon Peter instead of just Peter.
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:48.700]   1 Peter, he just says Peter.
[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:49.260]   Right?
[01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:51.580]   Now, it may not be anything.
[01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:53.580]   You may just be like, oh, he's just writing it.
[01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:56.220]   There might not be any specific significance to this.
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:57.780]   But there also may be.
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:58.660]   Right?
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:01.340]   So what do we know about this letter
[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:04.780]   that makes this very special?
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:07.500]   Remember we talked about that last week?
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:12.140]   What would make this letter a very special letter?
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:13.580]   It's the last letter.
[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.260]   So imagine if you're sitting in prison,
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:16.620]   and you know you're going to die,
[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:18.280]   and you're writing this letter, knowing
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.060]   that it's your last letter.
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:23.140]   You probably put a little bit more thought into it.
[01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:25.180]   And I would think that you're very
[01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:27.780]   conscious of what you're saying.
[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:30.420]   One of the things that--
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:33.540]   the distinction between 1 and 2 Peter--
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:36.340]   1 Peter, they believe that they had a--
[01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:37.220]   what was his name?
[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:39.540]   Silvanus.
[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:41.780]   Silvanus was the one who was dictating.
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:43.580]   He was saying it, and then he was dictating.
[01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:47.500]   So it was written in his verbiage.
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:50.660]   2 Peter, they believe that Peter himself wrote it by hand.
[01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:52.260]   And the reason why they believe that
[01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:58.140]   is his grammar and vocabulary is very low.
[01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:00.860]   So it's an uneducated fisherman who's writing it.
[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:03.260]   So some people debate that maybe Peter
[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:05.060]   didn't write the second letter, or Peter
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:07.180]   didn't write the first letter, because the grammar
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:10.660]   and the education level is very different between 1
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:11.900]   and 2 Peter.
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:14.500]   But there's a clear explanation for that,
[01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:17.020]   because 1 Peter clearly says Silvanus
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:18.820]   was the one who was taking dictation.
[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:21.660]   He was writing it down in his own words,
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.580]   where 1 Peter, they believe that he wrote it himself.
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:28.220]   So you can think, why would he do that?
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:30.700]   Because this is his last letter, most likely.
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.460]   He's writing his last letter.
[01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:35.460]   So everything he says here, I think he's being thoughtful.
[01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:37.020]   So even here-- again, I'm not going
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:38.740]   to spend this kind of time in every verse.
[01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:40.660]   But even here, it's just the title.
[01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:42.860]   Even the way he addresses himself,
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:45.980]   it's interesting, because he calls himself Simon Peter.
[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:50.340]   Remember, Peter is the name that Jesus gave to him.
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:52.380]   Simon was his birth name.
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:59.500]   Simon is his Hebrew name, which means hearer or listener.
[01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:02.780]   Remember what Peter's name is?
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.540]   Rock.
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:08.220]   So again, these are just passing thoughts.
[01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:10.260]   And I'm thinking Simon Peter.
[01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:12.060]   Like, why does he address himself?
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:15.140]   Some of you guys may have two names, like I do.
[01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:17.140]   When I was born, I was given a Korean name.
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:20.300]   And when I came to the States, some random pastor--
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:23.700]   I don't even know who he is-- gave me my name, Peter.
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:25.980]   All my brothers say, you shall be Paul.
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:26.820]   You shall be Peter.
[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:29.860]   You shall be Philip.
[01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:32.860]   So our names were given to us.
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:34.700]   And it didn't become my legal name
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:38.900]   until I was naturalized in, I think, my early 20s.
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:40.340]   I got naturalized.
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:41.980]   And so when I got naturalized, I didn't
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:45.060]   want to use my Korean name, because growing up,
[01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:47.780]   living in the East Coast and the Midwest,
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:49.860]   they didn't know how to pronounce my name.
[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:52.860]   So I changed it, because I was called Peter
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:54.020]   by all my American friends.
[01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:56.060]   And all my FOP friends would call me
[01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:58.540]   Con-ho, which is my Korean name.
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:00.540]   So I always went by two.
[01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:03.380]   And so after I changed my name, I'm called Peter.
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:05.660]   You guys probably never even heard my Korean name.
[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:08.660]   But my legal name is Peter Con-ho Kim.
[01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:10.820]   That's my full legal name.
[01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:14.700]   So when I write something in legal document, anything
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:18.140]   that's permanent, anything that requires identification,
[01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:20.460]   I have to put my full name on it.
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:22.900]   Now, I may just be reading into this.
[01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:24.660]   Peter may be writing this letter,
[01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:25.980]   knowing it's his last letter.
[01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:27.940]   And he's putting his imprint on it,
[01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:30.860]   because Peter was his given name.
[01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:31.820]   And it's common.
[01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:34.380]   Simon is also a very common Hebrew name.
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:36.540]   And by calling himself Simon Peter,
[01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:38.340]   I think maybe he's making sure that people
[01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:41.340]   know that this is coming from his hands.
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:44.060]   It's also interesting that the meaning behind this,
[01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:48.860]   because the word Simon in Hebrew means hearer, listener.
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:50.380]   But Jesus says, from now on, you're
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:53.740]   going to be called the Rock.
[01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:55.820]   And so Jesus' name's in that, because he
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:59.780]   was going to be the first apostle among the Jews.
[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:04.100]   And these two names are kind of like very humble,
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:06.860]   hearer, rock, the leader.
[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:09.700]   Even the way he introduced himself here, a bond servant,
[01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:12.300]   not just an apostle, but a slave of Christ.
[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:15.180]   And so the tone here, even in his introduction,
[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:18.060]   is very humble.
[01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:20.420]   He says, I'm writing to you, these people.
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:23.660]   You have the same faith, same kind of faith that I do.
[01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:25.340]   And we were partakers.
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:26.300]   We were granted this.
[01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:27.220]   We were given this.
[01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:28.780]   We received this.
[01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:32.020]   And so his whole tone is very humble.
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:35.060]   And if you think about it, Paul's name--
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:37.660]   Peter's name that was given to him as a rock,
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:38.940]   a leader that doesn't move.
[01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:41.100]   He said, I will build my church, and gates of Hades
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:43.340]   will not prevail against it.
[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:47.100]   But was Peter ever known as a rock?
[01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:49.380]   You think about it.
[01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:52.300]   If you think about Peter's character that's
[01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:57.020]   portrayed in the Bible, I mean, it's anything but a rock.
[01:19:57.020 --> 01:19:59.460]   He's the guy who jumps out, and he's like, oh my gosh,
[01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:00.260]   I'm going to drown.
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:03.260]   And Jesus has to save him.
[01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:06.420]   And he confesses, I will build my church upon this rock.
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:10.900]   And then next thing you turn around, he's rebuking Jesus.
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:12.580]   And then he's telling, they're all going to fail,
[01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:13.660]   but I'm not going to fail.
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:15.660]   I mean, he's not a humble man.
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:18.180]   And then he's the one who denies Jesus to his face,
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:20.860]   right after he said, I'm never going to deny you.
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:23.980]   Then even after Jesus is resurrected,
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:26.860]   remember, Apostle Paul calls him out in Galatians,
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:29.300]   because he was compromising with the Judaizers.
[01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:34.860]   So if you sum up Peter's life by character,
[01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:37.780]   he's not much of a rock, right?
[01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:40.060]   So he wasn't a humble man.
[01:20:40.060 --> 01:20:43.500]   I think he became humbled, right?
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:46.980]   He was humbled by life, by his mistakes.
[01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:49.180]   And so I think even in the introduction,
[01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:51.380]   here's a man who said, they're all going to fail,
[01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:52.700]   but I'm not going to fail.
[01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:54.500]   But even the way he introduced himself
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.220]   in the very last letter, you can kind of
[01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:58.900]   see a man who's been humbled, right?
[01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:01.300]   And he's kind of telling them, even though I'm writing this
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:03.300]   to you as an apostle, we have the same faith.
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:04.820]   Everything I have, you have, right?
[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:06.300]   That's the kind of tone that we see.
[01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:11.020]   So I share this because these are type of things
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:13.700]   that you don't have to be a scholar to know.
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:17.220]   You don't have to read the commentaries to gain insight.
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:19.660]   If you just spend time, give enough time
[01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:21.300]   in front of the Bible, asking questions,
[01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:23.820]   keep digging, digging, digging, you
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:25.660]   may not find the answer to all of it,
[01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:30.180]   but you'll be surprised how much insight you can gain by thinking
[01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:31.660]   about it over and over again.
[01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:34.940]   And so most of the commentaries that you read
[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:38.100]   are not because they studied the Greek and Hebrews,
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:41.620]   and they know how to put all the languages together.
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:43.700]   After you do this kind of study, and you go back
[01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:46.040]   to the commentary, you're going to see the same insights
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:47.660]   that you have, they have.
[01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:50.020]   90% of what they say in the commentaries
[01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:52.780]   are just coming from this kind of study,
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:55.180]   not because of deep insight into Greek
[01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:58.220]   or because they know Greek grammar.
[01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:00.140]   So I'm not going to do this to all of you,
[01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:02.900]   but I'm just kind of giving you some insight so that you can
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:04.980]   be encouraged in your Bible study.
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:09.660]   So all of this, one of the main things that I found
[01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:12.780]   is the tone of grace.
[01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:13.340]   Tone of grace.
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:16.460]   Everything he says here, he says, you have received this.
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:22.540]   You have received this.
[01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:26.220]   And then he says, this has been granted to you.
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:27.500]   Oh, did I make it bigger?
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:28.000]   OK.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.620]   This has been granted to you.
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:34.740]   This has been granted to you.
[01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:42.780]   We have become partakers, having escaped the crush.
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:45.100]   So all of this is kind of like description
[01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:46.700]   of what God's given us.
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:50.460]   Not what they have achieved, but what God has given them.
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:51.540]   So why does he say that?
[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:54.260]   Why does he say repeatedly over and over again,
[01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:56.900]   there's no, it's like, we did this, we worked hard.
[01:22:56.900 --> 01:23:00.780]   But he begins by saying, everything we have,
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:01.940]   we've been given.
[01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:03.140]   We've received it.
[01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:06.140]   It's been granted to us.
[01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:08.100]   Now, why does he say that?
[01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:11.860]   Considering what we've already read, what's coming.
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:15.260]   What was the main thing that he's going to be pushing
[01:23:15.260 --> 01:23:16.340]   through 2 Peter?
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:22.260]   Let's review this again.
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:26.660]   I think three chapters can be broken up into three parts.
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:27.620]   What's the first part?
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:35.580]   Pursue sanctification.
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:38.420]   Be diligent to pursue sanctification.
[01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:42.940]   Chapter 2, in your pursuit of sanctification,
[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:44.580]   watch out for these false prophets.
[01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:48.340]   They're going to come in and spread delusion.
[01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:51.900]   And then third, Jesus is coming.
[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:54.940]   So live like you know that Jesus is coming.
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:59.300]   So all of it is in the context of work hard.
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:01.500]   Strive, be diligent, pursue Godliness.
[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:03.500]   So if you look at next week's text,
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:06.580]   all of it is about adding to your faith,
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:09.420]   like moral excellence.
[01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:11.660]   And so you're supposed to strive after all this.
[01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:15.320]   But before he jumps into telling them to strive,
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.340]   what does he remind them?
[01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:18.260]   What's the foundation of our striving?
[01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:21.300]   God's grace.
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:25.140]   The foundation of our striving is the grace of God.
[01:24:25.140 --> 01:24:27.780]   It's because you've been given the grace of God
[01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:30.180]   that you are capable.
[01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:32.900]   You're capable of pursuing righteousness.
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:35.900]   So if you convince yourself that you're not capable,
[01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:37.300]   you're denying the grace of God.
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:40.540]   So according to that, what is the grace of God?
[01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:46.120]   According to 2 Peter, what is the grace of God?
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:51.320]   Your ability to pursue righteousness.
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:56.360]   It begins by justifying us, but the grace of God
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:00.160]   is giving you the ability to pursue holiness
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.680]   and righteousness.
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:06.120]   So if we somehow convince ourself justification
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:09.680]   is from God, and so sanctification is like,
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:13.380]   ah, I'm gonna struggle, and I don't have the ability.
[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:15.700]   Some people do, some people don't.
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:18.360]   And then once you tell yourself that,
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:21.600]   you've already given yourself an excuse not to pursue it.
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:24.480]   He said everything that's been, you've been given to it.
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:28.140]   So if you say, oh, it's easy for them, not for me,
[01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:31.000]   what you're saying is God's given them grace, but not me.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.720]   He says, no, everybody has been given the same grace.
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:37.480]   If you're a child of God, you've been given the same grace.
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:38.540]   That's what Paul says.
[01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:41.380]   The faith that I have is the same faith you have.
[01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:45.100]   So if you say it's easy for you, but it's not easy for me,
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:48.280]   it's you're basically saying God's grace is abundant for you
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:50.180]   but God's grace isn't abundant for me.
[01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:54.140]   At the end of the day, that's what you're saying,
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:56.460]   that God's grace isn't enough.
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:00.040]   Grace is the ability to pursue righteousness.
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:02.520]   And then, I mean, that's why I believe
[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:07.060]   that this verse is the central verse of this letter.
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:09.720]   He said grace and peace, right?
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:12.680]   That's what grace and peace is God's justification.
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:15.700]   He chooses us, given us, through the grace,
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:17.340]   He's given us peace with Him.
[01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:19.280]   And as a result, He says,
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:22.960]   continue to multiply this grace and peace.
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:24.920]   That's our sanctification,
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:27.280]   which is what He's gonna be getting at the rest of the letter.
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:28.120]   How are we doing that?
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:31.080]   Knowledge of His Son, Jesus Christ.
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:34.600]   I believe that this kind of is the central verse to me.
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:37.340]   It kind of wraps up the whole letter, right?
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:40.480]   May God's grace and peace be multiplied to you.
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:41.320]   How?
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.480]   In the knowledge of His Son, Jesus Christ.
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:45.120]   So everything that we need and understand about salvation
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.120]   is contained in this verse, in verse two.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:50.600]   Yes?
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.320]   Okay.
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.260]   So I don't know about you,
[01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:56.640]   but understanding that empowers me.
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:00.840]   I think the first thing that deflates
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.960]   my desire to pursue righteousness
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:05.120]   is the thought that I can't do it,
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:06.600]   or this too hard for me.
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:09.480]   It's easy for you, but it's,
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:11.580]   oh, you're a pastor, so it's easy for you.
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:15.860]   I didn't become a pastor because it was easy for me.
[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:16.700]   Do you know what I mean?
[01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:18.940]   I mean, same human being like you.
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:20.180]   Everything you have, I have.
[01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:22.360]   Everything I have, you have, right?
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:25.000]   Everything I have, you have.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.100]   So it's not like there's certain people
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:28.860]   that's easy to be a Christian,
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:31.100]   easy to pursue, easy to love,
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:33.140]   and so those people became pastors
[01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:34.980]   and missionaries or whatever,
[01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:37.100]   and the rest of us, like, oh, God doesn't expect that.
[01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:39.180]   He didn't give us the same grace.
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:42.100]   He said, no, God has given you the exact same grace.
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:43.980]   If you're a child of God, you have the Holy Spirit.
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:45.660]   Everything I have, you have.
[01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:47.980]   Everything I'm able to pursue, you're able to pursue.
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:51.180]   That's why, maybe because I've been studying the Bible
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:53.020]   much longer than you have, it's easier for me
[01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:55.100]   to gain insight to certain things,
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.380]   but I started where you started,
[01:27:57.380 --> 01:27:59.940]   and it didn't come because I woke up one day
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:01.780]   and studying the Bible became easier.
[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:06.420]   It just became more, I don't know how to use the word fun,
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:08.820]   but it is fun because you,
[01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:11.740]   yeah, because you gain, I feel like I gain treasure,
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:15.180]   and I get to know God more the more I study,
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:18.060]   and I've just been doing it longer than most of you,
[01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:18.900]   you know what I mean?
[01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:23.540]   But most of what I know about the Bible came through this,
[01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:26.340]   like doing this, but doing this every week
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:28.180]   for many, many years, right?
[01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:33.180]   So this is not unique to pastors or other people, all right?
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:38.140]   All right, I'm just gonna stop there for the sake of time,
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:40.900]   and then I'm just gonna give you a little bit of directive.
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:43.540]   I'm not gonna break up this text for the sake of time,
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:48.960]   but I'm probably gonna email this out to you,
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.880]   so it's just, I wanna give you some directive
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:53.340]   for the next text that's coming up.
[01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:56.240]   So next text is verse five through 11,
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:59.540]   and so if you know that text,
[01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:02.900]   obviously there's a list applying all diligence,
[01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:04.620]   knowledge, self-control, perseverance,
[01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:06.180]   godliness, brotherly kindness, love,
[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:09.180]   and whenever you see a list of things like that,
[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:13.540]   slow down and ask, like, is there purpose
[01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:16.700]   for the order of this list, right?
[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:20.740]   Like, you know, maybe when you and I write,
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:23.740]   we may just kind of wing it and randomly put things together.
[01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:25.420]   This is written by the Holy Spirit,
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:27.600]   who has full control, right?
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.220]   Nothing is random.
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:31.120]   So when you see a list like this,
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.380]   the first thing you wanna ask is,
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:37.500]   is there a purpose to this list and this order?
[01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:38.620]   And in order to know that,
[01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:40.520]   you have to know the meaning behind each one.
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:42.500]   So this is one of those situations
[01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:44.260]   where it would be helpful to you
[01:29:44.260 --> 01:29:46.460]   to maybe dig a little bit further.
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:48.620]   And go to, you know, Pastor Peter Chung
[01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:52.740]   has been sending out different translations, right?
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:56.180]   You have the ESV, NIV, NASB, and then I think LSB,
[01:29:56.180 --> 01:29:58.460]   and I forgot what other, King James.
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:00.140]   And so this is one of those things
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:02.060]   where you wanna look at the different translations
[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:05.420]   and see if it say they use the same word.
[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:08.180]   You understand what I'm saying?
[01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:09.020]   See if they use the same,
[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:11.300]   but because if you see certain words
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:14.420]   that sound very different than the words that's used in NASB
[01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:16.160]   you already know that that word
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:19.460]   is probably difficult to translate with one word.
[01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:21.080]   Or there's some sort of a debate as to like,
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:24.460]   oh, maybe there's several ways to translate this.
[01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:26.900]   So every once in a while you'll come into a verse
[01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:28.440]   where it'll sound very different
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:30.500]   from translation to translation.
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:32.160]   So when you come across something like that
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:34.580]   it means for you to take your time.
[01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:36.700]   There's something going on that even the scholars
[01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:41.020]   couldn't be unified in the way they translated it, okay?
[01:30:41.020 --> 01:30:42.760]   So when you have a list like this
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:45.660]   and there's descriptive words,
[01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:47.500]   again, slow down, ask questions.
[01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:50.660]   Is there a purpose to the order of this list?
[01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:53.940]   Why is this word first, right?
[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:55.640]   Why is this word last?
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:59.500]   And why is it in this particular order?
[01:30:59.500 --> 01:31:02.260]   Does the one before it and one after it,
[01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:05.740]   does it have some sort of a connection, right?
[01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:07.660]   Or is it just random?
[01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:10.500]   Pretty sure it's not random, okay?
[01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:12.700]   So watch out for that.
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:18.360]   Are there any parallels or comparisons, right?
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:19.980]   So if you look at this text, it'll say,
[01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:22.640]   if you do this, this will happen.
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:26.220]   If you don't do this, this will happen, right?
[01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:28.580]   So look at parallels, it's comparing.
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:32.500]   In our pursuit, if you pursue sanctification in this way,
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:37.500]   it will cause you not to be unfruitful and useless, right?
[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:41.020]   But if you don't do this and you're not pursuing,
[01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:42.980]   what does it say, right?
[01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:44.940]   You've forgotten where you came from,
[01:31:44.940 --> 01:31:46.300]   you forgot what you have.
[01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:47.520]   You forgot the grace of God,
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:49.380]   basically that's what it's saying, right?
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:50.860]   So look at the comparisons.
[01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:55.020]   How is it comparing, you know, and then just chart,
[01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:56.900]   you know, where is this taking me?
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:58.580]   Ask probing questions.
[01:31:58.580 --> 01:32:02.260]   This is one of those verses you really wanna ask,
[01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:05.440]   the cross-references, okay?
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:08.360]   So certain key verses, look for cross-references.
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:12.140]   What do other texts say about this?
[01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:15.740]   Because somebody can come out of this text
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:18.340]   and then say, salvation is by what?
[01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:21.380]   Works.
[01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:24.140]   If you look at certain language that he uses here,
[01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:26.700]   somebody can look at, jump into this text and say,
[01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:29.980]   hey, look at this text, it says salvation by works, right?
[01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:32.260]   So make sure that you look up verses.
[01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:33.660]   And then you have other people say,
[01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:35.940]   one saved, always saved, right?
[01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:40.820]   So our works doesn't matter, it's just legalism.
[01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:44.020]   And so make sure that as you're studying this,
[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:47.100]   that you're able to wrestle with that, right?
[01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:48.220]   If somebody was to ask you that,
[01:32:48.220 --> 01:32:50.420]   how would you answer that from this text
[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:52.380]   and then go to cross-references, see what it says?
[01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:53.760]   Do you understand what I'm saying?
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:55.500]   Yeah, so this is one of those texts
[01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:57.180]   that you wanna compare with other texts
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:32:59.380]   to make sure that you get the full understanding
[01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:01.700]   of what he's saying and not just this, okay?
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:07.140]   Then obviously, like every study that you do,
[01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:08.460]   you wanna ask a practical question.
[01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:10.980]   How does this apply to you, right?
[01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:12.020]   How does this specifically,
[01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:14.780]   but don't just approach it academically.
[01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:20.660]   Are you pursuing moral excellence, right?
[01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:22.380]   Is your knowledge of God growing?
[01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:26.260]   Do you have growing self-control?
[01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:29.980]   Can you say you've been persevering?
[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:31.460]   Is there godliness?
[01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:33.500]   Is there brotherly kindness?
[01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.020]   And ultimately, is there love?
[01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:35.940]   Is it increasing?
[01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:37.140]   Not just do you have it,
[01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:39.180]   but are you actively pursuing these things?
[01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:41.860]   So make sure that every inductive Bible study
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:46.020]   concludes with application, okay?
[01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:49.100]   All right, so you guys have two weeks.
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:52.300]   Don't cram this, there's too many verses to cram, okay?
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:53.580]   So let me pray for us,
[01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:56.740]   and then you guys can go and finish your Bible study.
[01:33:56.740 --> 01:33:59.020]   I think if you have children,
[01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:02.180]   you're supposed to pick them up at 9.15, okay?
[01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:05.580]   Oh, and then I have, again, some discussion questions.
[01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:10.380]   I was debating whether I should give it to you or not,
[01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:11.780]   but since we're in the beginning,
[01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:13.900]   I may not do this every week,
[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:18.260]   but for today and maybe for the first few weeks,
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:20.940]   I'm gonna direct you to some discussion questions.
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:22.700]   Lists all the things that God has given us
[01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:23.900]   for the life of godliness.
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:25.740]   He says everything has been given to you,
[01:34:25.740 --> 01:34:28.980]   specific as to what you know the Bible says
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:32.380]   is given to you for the purpose of godliness, okay?
[01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:34.820]   What areas do you think you are weak in?
[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:37.320]   How much of your energy is focused on what you have
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:38.740]   versus what you don't have,
[01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:40.020]   and how does that affect the way
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:42.740]   you live your Christian life, okay?
[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:44.780]   If we have everything we need for life of godliness,
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:48.100]   why does it seem so hard to bear fruit sometimes?
[01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:49.700]   That's a very practical question.
[01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:52.140]   What has caused you to grow the most in your walk with God
[01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:54.500]   in the past year or months, okay?
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:56.060]   So these are some application questions.
[01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:59.020]   So if you have your own questions that you wanna discuss,
[01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:01.620]   obviously, you're more than welcome to do that,
[01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:03.140]   but I'm just kinda giving you some guidance
[01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:04.540]   since we're in the beginning, okay?
[01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:05.980]   Let me pray for us, and then I'll let you guys
[01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:07.140]   go to your Bible study.
[01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:13.780]   Heavy Father, I thank you so much for your Holy Spirit
[01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:17.500]   and your living word that you give to us.
[01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:19.540]   Help us to glean from your word,
[01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:22.700]   not to turn from it to the left or to the right,
[01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:25.780]   and especially, Lord God, as we see our culture around us
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:27.340]   drifting away from you,
[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:29.660]   help us to cling to the truth of your word.
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:32.900]   We pray, Lord God, that it would truly judge
[01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:35.300]   the thoughts and intentions of our own heart,
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:37.140]   that we may be sanctified,
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:39.220]   that we may be better worshipers,
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:42.940]   that we may pursue holiness, Lord God, with all diligence.
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:44.600]   We praise you and we ask for your blessing
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.660]   over our time of small group.
[01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:48.400]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:51.560]   (footsteps)
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:53.880]   (footsteps)
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:56.200]   (footsteps)
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:59.860]   (clears throat)
[01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:02.020]   (silence)
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:04.180]   (silence)
[01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:06.340]   (silence)
