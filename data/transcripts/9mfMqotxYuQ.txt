[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   [ Laughter ]

[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   >> All right.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Let's compose ourselves.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   All right.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Let's compose ourselves.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   All right.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   I'm going to go ahead and open us up in a word of prayer.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Father, as we have just discussed,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   help us not to forget the why behind all these applications
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   we're exhorted to have in our lives.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Ultimately, it's for your glory,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   for adorning the doctrine of our God, our Savior,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   and help us, Lord God, to leave here after the teaching,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   after the sharing and the praying,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   just longing to just be better representatives of your truth.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   So would you minister to us in this time of short feeding
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   and help us to really apply appropriately
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   in all these things we pray in Jesus' name?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   So the first couple slides is a review of last week,
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   but I felt like it's important because the context
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   of what we're looking at today is the same.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Okay?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   So the whole thrust is how should we behave as Christians?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And if you guys noticed the repetition of good deeds
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   and show yourself, that showed up twice today.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Najarez, if you saw that, show, show, right?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It's to be measurable, right?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Are Christians supposed to judge Christians,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I mean, in the best of ways?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Absolutely, right?
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Our works are supposed to be visible.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   So how should we behave as Christians
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   is what we're looking at in chapters 2, verses 1 through 10.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   And as we looked at the why should we behave as Christians
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   is actually more important.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   So one, it's to be a good example to the next generation
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   of Christians, to be faithful stewards of the word of God,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   nonbelievers and scoffers, that they may be silenced,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   and that we as Christians can make the doctrine of God
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   attractive and beautiful to nonbelievers.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   So that's, like, all the qualities,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   even if you're an older man, some of the things
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   that are in the qualities for younger women,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   we should strive to excel at those things too, right,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   where appropriate.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   So the ultimate point in chapter 2 really is
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   the evangelistic impact of a spiritually healthy congregation.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   It's not for our well-being, it really is for God's glory,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   and that's the thrust.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And like I shared with you last week, when I break it down,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   I look at all the--like, I'm just doing this in English,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   and I look at this, and I have all the commands on the side.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And I discovered today that in chapter 2, verse 9,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   that urge is not in the command.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   So then I'll go back, and I will--
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   and you guys notice that? It's italicized.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   It's implied from previous verses.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   But all of these are commands given to Titus.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   These are the groups.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And today we looked at young men, Titus himself,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   and bond slaves, and there are four hinnas,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   the so-that's, right?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And that's the reason why we are called to do these things.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   And so whenever you look at a chapter,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   it's also important not to get lost in the nitty-gritty details
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   of, like, one particular verse.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   You want to look at it in the context of the whole.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   All right?
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   So because a lot of what we looked at today
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   is similar to elements for the elders in chapter 1
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   and the things that we looked at last week,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I'm going to do something a little bit different today.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I'm going to go over one word, "sensible,"
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   and then I'm going to look at bond slaves
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   and how it relates to us, and that's--
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   hopefully it's going to be a little bit shorter.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   So here's chapter 2, verse 6.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   It says, "Sensible, likewise urge the young men
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   to be sensible," and this word "sensible,"
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   now it's the fourth time it's shown up.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   It's going to show up again next week in an adverb form.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Okay?
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   So the word "sensible" is "sophron,"
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   and it's very--it's a very talented word
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   because it can take the shape of many different meanings.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Okay?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   So the way I read the word "sensible," "sophron,"
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   it really is having the mind of Christ.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Okay, having a balanced mind of Christ,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   being sound, spiritual mind.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   All right?
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   So here the definition is "possessing mental
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   and emotional composure," not being distracted,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   not impulsive, but focused,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   and this was a requirement for pastors, elders.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   It's a requirement for older men, for younger women,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   and here for the younger men as well.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Okay?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And this is how elsewhere in the New Testament
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   the word "sensible" has been used.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   So to give you the multi-talented usages
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   of this word "sensible," to kind of give you a mean--
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   like a better feel for the meaning of the word "sensible."
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Mark 5:15, this is the demoniac, okay?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   "They came to Jesus and observed the man
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   who had been demon-possessed sitting down,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   clothed and sophron."
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   The very man who had the legion,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   and they became frightened.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   So this is almost made whole, restored.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Demon has been cast out.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   He is now sophron.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Another way it's being used, Romans 12:3,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   "For through the grace given to me,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I say to everyone among you
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   not to think more highly of himself
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   than he ought to think,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   but to think so as to sophron,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   have sound judgment,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   as God has allotted to each man
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   each a measure of faith."
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   So here is an objective humility as well, right?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Humility is not insecurity or like inferiority complex.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   If you are really good at something,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   saying you're not is not humility.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   That's just disguised pride, right?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   But here, understanding that
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   all that we've been given is from the grace of God,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   just being a humble person
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   with a sound mind, okay,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   is also a way sophron is used.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   2 Corinthians 5, 13-14,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   this is Paul talking about his cohorts,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   "For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   If we are of sound mind, it is for you.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   For the love of Christ controls us,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   having concluded this, that one died for all,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   therefore all died."
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   So here's an element of a very contained,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   controlled zeal, okay?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   1 Peter 4, 7,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   "The end of all things is near, therefore be sophron."
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   So thinking clearly.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And in Ephesians 5, 18, like we looked at last week,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   being filled with the spirit.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Really, right?
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Like just don't be drunk on wine,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   or Netflix, or video games,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   or the internet, or Facebook,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   or social media, nothing.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Just be filled with the spirit
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   is another way I would describe sophron, sensible.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   It's a fruit of the spirit.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   The word sophron doesn't show up in the fruit of the spirit,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   but its adjectives, or its, what do you call it,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   synonyms do, alright?
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   And the reason I wanted to do it like this
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   is because sophron is mentioned often
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   in all these lists, okay?
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   And it comes in different shapes and colors,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   but all of it really is having the mind of Christ, okay?
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   And not being, not having that mind
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   distracted or perverted in any way.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   So I'm gonna get to some fun stuff here.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   We're gonna look at verse 9 and 10.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   "Urge bond slaves to be subject to their own masters
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   "and everything to be well-pleasing,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   "not argumentative, not pilfering,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   "but showing all good faith
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   "so that they will adorn the doctrine of God,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   "our Savior, in every respect."
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   I'm just gonna be looking at the word masters.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   The Greek word is despotis.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   It sounds like what?
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Despot, okay?
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   So it denotes a person with absolute power and authority.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Now the slavery, or the master-slave relationship
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   that we think of in more modern history,
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   it is different from that of biblical times, okay?
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   So there is more of an employee-employer feel,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   just minus any kind of union protection, all right?
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Just think of it like that.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   You have no rights.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   But it's not like the slavery that we're thinking of
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   when we're looking at, like, Civil War, okay?
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   So a despotis really is a master.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   One question that I asked as I was preparing this was like,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   in Colossians, there's actually requirements
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   for Christian masters, too.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   How come in Titus there's nothing about masters?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   I thought that just was interesting.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Were there no Cretan Christian masters at this time?
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Only bond slaves?
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Bond slaves seem to have a lot of freedom.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   They can pilfer.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   They can talk back.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   It's like, how dare you, right?
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   So there's stuff that these masters have power over
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   in terms of a person.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Okay?
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   And here's just something that, like, on his commentary on Titus
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   that John MacArthur wrote that I just wanted to share.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   If bond slaves are obligated to submit to their absolute
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   and often cruel and arbitrary masters,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   how much more are free believers obligated to submit
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   to an employer, even one who is mean, unreasonable,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   and overbearing?
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   And we're going to--I'm going to talk about this toward the end.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   But in your workplaces, there is a master figure, right?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   So I want to see how verses 9 through 10 apply to us, okay?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   So verse 9, it talks about, "In everything to be well-pleasing."
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Okay?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Then that causes you, if you're a very good Bible student,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   to start asking all kinds of inductive questions.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   What does "in everything" mean?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Right?
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   If they tell us to go kill somebody, do we do that?
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   If they tell us to lie and change this form
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   or submit a faulty report, is that what we do?
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Right?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   And you guys inevitably may come to situations
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   where you're actually asked to do stuff like--
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   that goes against your conscience, right?
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   So one thing that's tricky about making absolutes--
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   we're going to get to one in chapter 3
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   where it says, "Remind them to be obedient to the authorities."
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   It's like, "Ooh, but what does that mean?"
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Right?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   So when the Scripture commands us to do something like this,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   and then we also know in Scriptures, like Acts 5:28-29,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   we must obey God rather than men.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Wait, which one are we to apply?
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Right?
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Acts 25, 28-29, saying, "We gave you strict orders
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   not to continue teaching in this name,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   and yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   and intend to bring this man's blood upon us."
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   But Peter and the apostles answered,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   "We must obey God rather than men."
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   So now there are probably going to be many,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   like, "But what about..." kind of questions
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   that come into your mind.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   But I'm going to try to keep it simple.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   As far as it doesn't cause you to have to sin
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   or compromise, truth.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Here it says, "Be subject to your masters in everything."
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   As far as--however far you have to go,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   "Be subject to your own masters in everything
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   to the point where, or as long as,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   it doesn't cause you to have to sin or compromise truth."
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Okay?
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Now, there's tension already.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Okay? I'm going to unpack this a little bit.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Titus 2--or 1 Peter 2, 18-19 in Colossians 3
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   also give us additional instructions
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   on how bond slaves are to be toward their masters.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   1 Peter 2, "Servants, be submissive to your masters
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   with all respect, not only to those who are good
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   toward God a person bears up under sorrows
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   when suffering unjustly."
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Colossians 3, 1-3, and then 22-24.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   We're looking at our identity first,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   and then the exhortations to slaves.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   "Therefore, if you have been raised up with Christ,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   keep seeking the things above,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Set your mind on the things above,
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   not on the things that are on the earth.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   For you have died, and your life is hidden
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   with Christ in God."
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   So that's the premise of the beginning of Colossians,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   and here's one application for slaves.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   "Slaves, in all things obey those
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   who are your masters on earth,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   not with external service as those who merely please men,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Whatever you do, do your work heartily.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Ask for the Lord rather than for men,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   knowing that from the Lord you will receive
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   the reward of the inheritance.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   It is the Lord Christ whom you serve."
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Now, obviously, there are going to be some differences
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   between the situation of the bond slaves in Crete
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   to our situations being workers
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   in Orange County, United States in 2021,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   but just draw the appropriate parallels, okay?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   If you are an employee, and you have an employer, okay?
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Can that be--
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   can the bond slave master illustration
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   be applicable to your situation, yes or no?
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Yeah. Raise your hand if you have an employer.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Okay, that's most of you.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   If you're a boss, there's nothing in here about bosses,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   so we're going to leave you alone for tonight, all right?
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   But most of us are employees.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   So when you're trying to figure out how to honor the Lord
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   by applying these verses in Titus, 1 Peter,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Colossians appropriately, there are going to be times
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   where it's very uncomfortable trying to figure out
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   what is the best way to, like, be faithful
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   to what the scriptures are telling me to do
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   and being very unhappy at work, right?
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Like, the owner is nudging me towards
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   some kind of a compromise.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   How do I--right?
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   There's going to be a lot of situations
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   that will make you feel uncomfortable,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   and that's normal, okay,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   because we're living in a fallen world.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   But in Colossians, at the end, it actually says
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   it's the Lord Christ whom you serve.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   So have you thought about this question?
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   At your workplace, are you serving the Lord?
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   If you've never asked this question, shame on you,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   because you've, like, you've--what do you call that?
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Like, just divided your spheres of life, right?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   I'm at work.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   I'm all in it for me and my future and my career
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   and blah, blah, blah.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   At church, I'm a holy, moly Christian.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   At home, kind of like a combination of the two.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   I don't know.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   But one thing that I wanted to emphasize tonight
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   is that if you are an employee anywhere,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   you are a missionary.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Nod your heads if you understand.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   It's not try to be a missionary.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   You are.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   You are a representative of Christ in that place.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Just by default.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Unless you've never shared with anybody about your faith,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   about church, okay, then that's a different problem
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   in and of itself.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   But in this area where there is a human master
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   under whom you're supposed to be subject at work
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   for some kind of compensation, obviously,
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   you are a Christian bond slave.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   And as a Christian bond slave,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   it is the Lord Christ whom you are serving in that arena,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   whether you realize it or not.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Okay?
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   So the thing that I want to emphasize,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   because we don't need to go into all the, like,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   what does this word mean, what does that word mean,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   because this section has kept it, for the most part,
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   pretty simple.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   But the things that I wanted to challenge you with,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   tonight's more of a pastoral, like,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   let's really get to the nitty-gritty of where the rubber
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   meets the road.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   In your workplace, in your mission field,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   are you regularly preparing for and engaging
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   in spiritual combat?
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   In your mission field, are you gearing up really
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   for spiritual combat?
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Are you there to make money or to glorify the Lord?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Are you there to put in your time,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   or in your mission field, do you have a concern
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   and a care for souls?
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   And if you're going to, we're going to look at verse 11,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   and you're going to see why I'm making this jump.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Okay, it's not a jump.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   It's a natural, logical flow.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Are you caring about the souls that are at your job?
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   So for me, sometimes I wonder, people who prefer
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   to work remote.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   You're so selfish, and I don't know who you are,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   so I can just say that at a blanket.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   If you consider the totality of your life
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   as a missionary while you're here,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   and the obsession for every Christian
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   is the Great Commission, making disciples of all nations
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   by going, baptizing, and teaching them to do everything
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   that Christ has taught, right?
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   If the obsession of your life is to glorify God
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   and to build his church and to save the lost,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   are you handling the place where you are spending
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   most of your week well?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Shame on you if you prefer working remote.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   And again, commute and all this stuff,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   I'm just throwing out as a blanket statement,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   because how are you going to reach those people
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   if you don't get face-to-face time with them?
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   How are you going to build relationships
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   to win them over to Christ
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   if you don't want to have anything to do with them?
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   And you're more worried about your comfort
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   and your convenience, be able to work on your pajamas,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   wake up and just do this with your eyes
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   and just get to work.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Second question, in your mission field,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   are you making progress in silencing
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   every anti-Christian critic?
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Or are you the one that, like, you're a Christian
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   and everyone knows you're a Christian,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   but people don't think you're that great a worker?
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Are you well-pleasing?
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Or are you argumentative?
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Are you pilfering your boss's time?
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Okay, those are things that you need to consider.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Third, are you showing yourself
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   to be trustworthy in everything
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   when the boss is not looking at your workplace?
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Because remember, it is the Lord Christ
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   whom you are serving.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Are you being a good witness to other fellow bond slaves
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   who might not be Christian bond slaves,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   but they're also there?
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Are you a good bond slave,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   making the gospel attractive to other bond slaves?
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Are you willing to make sacrifices
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   to be a more effective missionary?
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   If you were to say, "Hey, Pastor Peter,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   I want to go to China,"
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   most likely, I'll tell you,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   have some sellable skill,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   because people aren't going to--
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   like, they're not always down to support you,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   and that financial support, it's going to dry up.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   So if you want to do mission work,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   one of the best things to do is to be a tent maker,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   which means you're just a Christian
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   in a cross-cultural context,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   and the only reason you're working
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   is just to make ends meet,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   because your job there is not your goal.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   What is your goal in the mission field?
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   To be a missionary.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Why is that different here?
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Right?
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   So we're willing to make sacrifices
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   to go out of our comfort zone
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   only if he calls us abroad to be a missionary,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   but you don't realize that same call
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   is for you where you're at right now.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   You're supposed to, even if it means,
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   "I will stay at this job
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   "even if that job can offer me better, like, package.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   "I will stay here because there are souls to be won here."
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Are you actively looking for opportunities to share?
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   And I think this is such an important topic
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   to discuss with us,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   because a lot of us think of our careers
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   being something that exists for our happiness
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   and our comfort.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   That's a worldly desire.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   That's ungodliness.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   If you guys have memorized Titus 2,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   you know what happens in verse 12?
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   "For the grace of God has appeared,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   "bringing salvation to all men," verse 12,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   "instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   "but to live sensibly, righteously, godly in the present age."
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Okay?
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   So we're going to get there.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   This is like a--just--we're transitioning into that.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   But you thinking your career is for you
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   is a very immature Christian thought.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   Nod your heads if you understand what I'm trying to get at.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Your job is a vehicle to give glory to God
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   and to save souls.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Think of that next time you look at the packages
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   that are offered to you.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Hey, but because if someone goes to China as a missionary,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   someone decides to go to India as a missionary,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   you're not expecting them to take the best financial package.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Oh, no.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   They've forsaken the world.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   They've taken up the cross,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   and they've committed to follow Christ.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   But that's for those guys.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   That's not for us here.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   And that's a lot harder to shake
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   than anything else in our culture where we live.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Okay?
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   So I'm picking on verses 9 and 10
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   because sometimes when we look at this
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   and we scrutinize it academically,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   we kind of forget the heart behind this.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   You as a bond slave with an earthly master,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   you as a missionary in whatever mission field you're in,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   you're supposed to make this doctrine of God our Savior
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   attractive in every respect.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Is that verse 10?
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   To cosmeo the doctrine of God in every respect.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Are you faithful to that
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   where you're spending 40-plus hours a week?
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Okay?
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   And so I want to close with this Romans 12, 1 to 3.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Romans is the book we all go to for just pure gospel,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   like doctrinal richness.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   And then if you guys have studied Romans,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   1 through 11 is a lot of theology and doctrine.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   12 and on is application.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   So here's chapter 12 of Romans.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   This is, like, where it transitions, okay?
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   "Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   "to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   "acceptable to God,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   "which is your spiritual service of worship.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   "Do not be conformed to this world,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   "but be transformed by the renewal of your mind,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   "henna, so that you may prove what the will of God is,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   "that which is good and acceptable and perfect.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   "For through the grace given to me,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   "I say to everyone among you,
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   "not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   "but to think so as to have sofron,
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   "as God has allotted to each measure of faith."
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   You're not the first Christian on this planet.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   You don't exist for you.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   You're created by God and for God to love God and to serve God.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   That's your identity as a Christian.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Amen?
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   So are you going to be so--
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   are you going to have a sofron mentality?
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Here's just two things recently that I found
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   that was very helpful for me.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   So just kind of think clearly here.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   The gospel, Paul Washer says,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   does not call us to receive Christ as an addition to our life,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   but as our life.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Amen?
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   But is that true of you in your workplace?
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Martin Luther uses this word "bondslave,"
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   so I think that's why it caught my eye.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   "The will of man without the grace of God is not free at all,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   "but is the permanent prisoner and bondslave of evil,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   "since it cannot turn itself to good."
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   But you know what Titus teaches us?
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   We've been free because of who?
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Because of Christ.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   So you're no longer a slave to sin.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   It's also elaborated on in Romans 8.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   On earth, you may be a slave,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   but you're not a slave to sin.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   So live as free men.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   So the question today is,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   as you are called to be a bondslave who is a missionary
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   in your earthly master's home,
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   are you trustworthy?
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Are you excellent?
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Are you adorning the gospel in every respect?
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Or are you pilfering?
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Are you argumentative?
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Are you selfish?
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Because there are gospel ramifications
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   to your witness at work.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   And your families.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Some of you guys, I mean, sometimes you come in for counseling
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   and say, "Oh yeah, I'm having trouble with my non-Christian mom
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   "or my non-Christian dad."
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   And maybe you consider maybe it's your fault.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Maybe you're the one hindering them
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   with certain attitudes.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Or maybe they see you as more religious and kind of insane
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   than sound.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   So today, that verse 9 and 10 of this bondslave mentality
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   will bleed into the doctrine-heavy section next week.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   And I want to just give us a little bit of a head start, okay?
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Urge bondslaves to be subject to their own masters in everything
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   to be well-pleasing and not argumentative, not pilfering,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   but showing all good faith
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   so that they will adorn the doctrine of God our Savior
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   in every respect.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   Why?
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   and to live so fraught, sensibly, righteously, godly in the present age.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   The point of all these lists
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   is not to be a better Christian.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   That's a natural byproduct.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   The point of all of this is to say,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   God is real, God is good,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   he died for me, not just to save me,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   but to transform me, to make me a new creation.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   The old is gone and the new has come.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   And that's changed every fabric of my being.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   So whether I eat or drink, I do it all for the glory of God.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Whether I'm filling out a spreadsheet or doing a presentation,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   whether I'm driving a client,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   whether I'm fixing up something that's completely meaningless,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   if there's a coffee spill, I don't wait for someone else to do it,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   I'll come and do it.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   And guess what happens?
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   Your non-Christian workers will have nothing bad to say.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   They will look at you and be like,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   "Dang, what does that person have that I don't?"
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   I'm not going to embarrass this person,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   but one of the most encouraging things I heard
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   about 17, 18 years ago at Berean
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   was there was a person whose co-worker came to church
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   and was there for about a month.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   And the reason, like, the person said that they came to visit the church was,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   this individual, this person is such a beautiful person.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   I had to come to the church to check out what makes him/her tick.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   And I was like, "Dang, that's a good witness."
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   That person comes in on Saturday?
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   That person, before I even ask, takes care of stuff?
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   And again, I'm hearing this through other channels.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   But I remember 17, 18 years ago hearing that, I'm like,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   "Wow, this person's pretty cool."
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Can you be that kind of a witness at your job?
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   So that even without saying anything,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   that there's something magnetic about the way you do your work.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   When people see you, there's an aroma of Christ.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   And they can't quite put a finger on what it is, but you're weird, you're different.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   Is that how you can work?
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Because whether or not you realize it,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   you're either a good missionary or a horrible one.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   You guys following this?
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   And why is all of our behavior and action important?
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Verse 11, salvation is here.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   And for some mysterious reason, God chooses to use man
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   to bring other men to the place where their eyes are open
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   and see the glory of God.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   So what I want you guys to do in your groups,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   a lot of this is not heavy, it's just like a little slap to be like,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   "Oh yeah, we're missionaries here."
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   To think through, what is--like, I need to fix this.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   I need to be more sensible.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   One, in what ways is our workplace a mission field?
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Have we been faithful missionaries?
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Two, how are you in your speech, in your doctrine?
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   In what areas do you need prayer coverage to help you to be sensible?
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   One thing is, I don't like sharing prayer requests.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Not me personally.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   But sometimes when I hear your prayer requests,
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   I'm like, "That's not a prayer request.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   That's like a wish list to Santa."
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   What a prayer request is, is I'm in spiritual warfare,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   trying to figure out how to--
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   like, my struggle is not against flesh and blood,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   it's against the principalities.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   I need help.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Right?
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   I struggle with pride.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   I struggle with anger.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   I struggle with addiction.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   I struggle with just resentment toward my boss.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Help me.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   And maybe tomorrow will be a different day.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   Okay, so those are what I call prayer coverage,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   in order for you to be more so front.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   All right?
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   So next week is this doctrinal, 2.11-15.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   We're just going in five-verse clumps now.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   But I would like us to wrap up with this.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   Okay?
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Let me pray for us.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Father, help us to represent you well to this dark and dying world.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Lord, not for our benefit, but ultimately for your joy
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   and for your glory.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   And I pray, Father God, that you would help us in this endeavor,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   for it's easy for us to get distracted, to drift, and forget.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   Lord, we love you and help our lives to really match
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   just the things that we say, we believe,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   and the things that we feel.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Help it to match.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   And by your grace, Lord, would you save souls through just our prayers
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   and through our witness.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   I pray these things in Jesus' name.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   Amen.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   [end]
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   [applause]
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   [music]
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   [music]
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
