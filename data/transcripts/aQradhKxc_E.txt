[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   We will now begin our service.

[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   >> All right, good morning.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   We have announcement from our college ministry.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Pastor Nate's going to come up here and give the announcement.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   >> Okay, good morning, everybody.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   If you are of the college age, we will be having next Sunday after third service.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   So we're saying 1.30, but it's going to be directly after third service,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   over there in the youth chapel, a welcome event.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And at this welcome event, we hope that you're able to join us,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   because we're going to be explaining some of the events,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   how college ministry kind of works, when we have our Bible studies,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   how to get rides, things like that.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   So if you can come to that, we'll be providing food for you,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   and you'll be able to meet some of our staff, our small group leaders,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   and hopefully I'll be able to meet you as well.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   So it's after third service.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   This is second service, so you would have to, if you come to this service,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   wait until after third service.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   But please do put that in your calendars, make it something that you set to go,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   because it's going to be very helpful for us to get to know you,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   but also for you to get to know this church.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   So hope to see you there next week.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Thank you.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   >> All right, a reminder, next Sunday is Communion Sunday,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   so please prepare accordingly before you come.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Next Sunday there's a Vine, our youth group lunch fundraiser,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   and they're raising funds for the retreat that's coming up.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   It'll be Mediterranean chicken bowl, they say, and $10 for adults and $5 for kids.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And, again, we do this every time we have a members meeting.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   So following the lunch, we're going to have our church members meeting.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Our new members will be presented, and also, again,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   there's going to be a service fair at church.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   So after our members meeting, we're going to be going out to the courtyard,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   and you can visit and see what kinds of ministries are out there,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   how you can get involved.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   So that's happening at 2 p.m.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   And so the lunch will be preceding that so that you don't have to go out,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   and afterwards at 2 p.m. we're going to be having members meeting.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And then women's ministry event, that's happening on October 19th on Saturday, 8:30 a.m.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   It's going to be in this room.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   And, again, if you haven't signed up, the cost of it is $10.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   So please sign up for that, and, again, on October 19th at 8:30 in this room.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   That's a Saturday.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And then, finally, family ministry picnic on Sunday, October 20th,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   and they're going to be holding it from 11 to 3.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   So it's kind of an open event, just opportunity to meet other family ministry members.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   So you can just grab your lunch and go to Bill Barber Park,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   and you just need to show up, and there will be other family members there
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   that you can get to know them better.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   It's a casual opportunity just to see who's in the ministry.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   So this is open for anybody in this ministry.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   So it's going to be from 11 to 3 p.m. at Bill Barber Park.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   So if you brought a physical offering, again, our physical offering box is in the back to the right
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   as you're exiting the sanctuary.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   But otherwise, for the rest of us, let me pray for us,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   and we'll give you a minute to give your offering electronically.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Then afterwards our brother Dominic is going to come up and give his testimony
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   and be baptized this morning.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Let's pray.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Father, we praise you and thank you for this morning
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   and for all that you are doing that we know of,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   many things, Lord, that you are orchestrating behind the scene.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And we pray, Father God, that as you drew us to yourself
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   and opened our eyes to see who you are,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   that you continue to allow us to see a greater and greater glimpse of your glory
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   so that all that we do will be an overflow of the powerful work that you are doing in us.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I pray that even in this giving, I pray that you would bless us,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   remind us, Lord God, that ultimately all of it is yours,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   and that our act of giving would be an expression of our love, our worship, and our lordship to you.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   May it be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Oh, okay. Hello everyone.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   My name is Dominic and this is my testimony.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   So, like many others, I grew up in the church.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   I went to Sunday school, like, every Sunday.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   I even attended a Christian school for my elementary school years.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   These were fun times, just growing alongside fellow children
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   from high school.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   In fifth grade, the year before, I transferred to public school.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   If I was asked what I believed in regards to religion,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   I would have said, "I am a Christian
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   who believes that Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   died for all sins on the cross and rose to life."
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   My belief in this statement was strong at the time,
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   but, of course, I was just a young child
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   and so I was a blank canvas still yet to be painted on.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Moving on to middle school,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   I was placed in a really new environment
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   that I wasn't accustomed to.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   However, I managed to find my footing
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   and I managed to finally graft myself in with all the other people.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   This was really good for me socially,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   but it was incredibly damaging spiritually.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   The reason for this is because public school
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   is quite literally a cesspit.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   In 1 Corinthians 15, verse 33,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   it says that bad company corrupts good morals.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   As I continued down the path of destruction,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   my faith was tainted.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Sin had taken hold of me and I began living a hedonistic life
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   like there was no end.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   My pride and ego ruled over my life
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   and sexual sin ran rampant in the background.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Starting high school, I was basically indistinguishable from an unbeliever.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Although I was still going to Sunday school,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   the information I received didn't pierce my heart.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   It didn't convict me to change in any way.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   And then COVID hit and all my church activities ceased.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   All I had left during that time was just my life,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   built on fully ego and just full pleasure,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   all for myself.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   My faith was essentially reduced to ashes.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   And even when things were back in person during the year,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   I didn't go back.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Fast forward to senior year college acceptance letters.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   I was sobered by the results, having only been accepted by UCI.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   I was relieved that, of course, a college of such a caliber accepted me.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   But the reality check came when I realized that it was far from home.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Questions filled my mind like, "Oh, what is my life going to be like?"
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   or "What is my life going to look like?"
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   This was UCI's academics.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   But a question I didn't expect to come to mind was,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   "What if I went back to church?"
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Oh, dang.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   In that very moment, I pondered that question and asked,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   "Well, what if? What if I went back to church?"
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   And now looking back on that moment,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   I know that it was God who was looking after me,
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   even though I had basically just given up all over.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   I gave up on him.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   But he never gave up on me, even though my sin ran so deep.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   I can't tell you if I repented once during those seven years of my life in public school.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And yet, as Psalm 136 says 26 times,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   God's loving kindness is everlasting.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   And by his mercy, he has brought me to Berean,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   where I have been blessed to walk alongside such wonderful brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   With their help, my faith has been restored.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   I have come to truly recognize and repent from my sins.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   And although breaking sinning habits is incredibly hard,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   I am willing to surrender everything
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   so that I might become more like him, just as he has commanded us,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   to be holy, just as he has commanded--
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   just be holy, for I am holy.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Thank you all.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   [applause]
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Do you understand when you go into the water, you're being united to Christ's death?
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   And when you come out, you're being united to his resurrected life?
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Yes.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Amen.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   [applause]
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   All right, Dominique, thank you for that encouraging testimony.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke 9.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   We're going to be reading from verse 23 up to verse 27.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Luke chapter 9, verse 23 to 27.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   "And he was saying to them all, 'If anyone wishes to come after me,
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   but whoever loses his life for my sake, he is the one who will save it.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   For whoever is ashamed of me and my words,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   But I say to you truthfully, there are some of those standing here
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.'"
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Let's pray.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   Father, we pray for deeper understanding.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   We pray for your grace to lead us and guide us.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   May your word and your word alone go forth, Lord God, from this pulpit.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   I think a few of you may or may not remember
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   there was a show back in the '70s called Tell the Truth.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   And it was--I think it had reruns in the '80s,
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   but the show started in the 1950s and '60s,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   and basically the premise of the show was
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   they would have somebody of what the world would consider
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   a significant show up,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   and this is before social media and computers,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   so even if somebody won the Olympics,
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   you wouldn't know what they looked like
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   because you would only see them on the newspaper.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   So you would bring maybe an Olympic gold medalist swimmer,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   and they would have them sitting among, like, six or seven different people,
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   and the whole show was basically they would pretend to be that one person.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   And so at the end of the show, after interviewing them,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   asking a bunch of questions,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   so the contestants would basically have to guess,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   "Who's the real one? Who's the real gold medalist?"
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   And so at the end, whoever it is that stands up,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   and if they got them right,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   then they would be the winners of that show.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   And so the premise of that thing is that
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   how do you discern who is genuine,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   and how do you discern who are just playing the game?
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   In our culture, I think in our generation of where you and I live,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   the biggest challenge that's facing the church today
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   is not external.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   It's internal.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   And that internal challenge is,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   who is and is not a Christian?
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   How do you identify a genuine follower of Christ
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   versus those who are just pretending?
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   How do you identify people where the warning of Jesus says,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   "Not everyone who calls me Lord, Lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven,"
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   when our churches are filled with people
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   who may have never committed their life to Christ?
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   And so obviously, I think most of you are sophisticated to know
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   that just coming to church doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Just because you've been baptized doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Just because you are a member of the church or serving the church,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   or maybe even a Sunday school teacher, it doesn't make you a Christian.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   You know that the Bible is clear on that.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   So how do we determine in a post-Christian culture
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   who is genuinely following Christ and who is not?
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Who are the people who are going to die,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   and then they're going to face the truth and the reality of who they are
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   when they meet the resurrected Christ for the first time?
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   So it's imperative that in a post-Christian culture
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   where our church belongs, that we help people.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   And maybe some people are genuinely deceived
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   because you were raised in a church and you just assumed.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   And you hear so many people who stand up here who are being baptized
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   and they give you the same testimony because they grew up in the church.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   They just assumed they were Christians.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   And once the Word of God began to get open to them,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   they realized that they were far from Christ.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   So how do we identify genuine Christianity versus cultural Christianity?
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   If you ask the general population in the United States,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   a number is as high as 75% to 78% that claim to be Christian.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Now, most of us know that that's not the case, 78%.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   So if it's not 78%, it's maybe 5%.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   But even the 5%, how did we come to that number 5%?
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   What was the criteria to determine that it's not 78% but it's actually 5%?
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   What was the litmus test that determined it's 5%?
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   We need to know because the question of who do you say I am
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   and how you answer that question and how you respond to that answer
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   will determine if you are a genuine follower of Christ or not.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   We looked at last week, Jesus was given his credential
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   and after he showed his power to the multitudes and to his disciples,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   he turns around and he asked them, "Who do you say that I am?"
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Not what the crowd say but who do you say that I am?
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And the response of the disciples, "You are the Christ of God."
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   So the first criteria of determining if somebody is a genuine follower of Christ
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   is do you know the Christ of the Bible?
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Not a cultural Jesus, not a Jesus that is convenient to follow,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   but do you know the Christ of the Bible?
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Do you have his identity correct?
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Yes, we are saved by grace, by faith alone,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   but it must be faith in the right Jesus.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   So that's the first litmus test,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   that we're not just confessing a Christ of our own making,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   but it is the Christ of the Bible.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   And the second that we're going to be looking at today
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   is that if you are a follower of Jesus Christ,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   you must actually follow Jesus Christ.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   No duh.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   But for whatever the reason, we have created a culture,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   a generation of people who have no interest in following Jesus Christ
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   other than using the title, "I'm a follower of Jesus Christ."
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Oh, you're actually following him? Not really.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   So the second criteria is are you following Jesus?
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   And then the third criteria is do you speak?
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Are you on the same mission that he's on?
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   And we'll look at that next week.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   The first we looked at last week,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   the second that we want to look at is come from Luke 9.23.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   It says, "If anyone wishes to come after me,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   "he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me."
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   He says the condition upon how you determine if somebody is following Jesus or not,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   he says he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   That's a prerequisite.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   Now, I'm going to get to this at the end,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   but I want to introduce a question to you here.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Who would want to follow Jesus if this is what he presents?
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Consider how the gospel is being presented today.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Give Jesus a chance.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Would you open your heart and receive him in your life?
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Would you accept Jesus?
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   And so the gospel is presented.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   God loves you.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   You have sinned.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   He wants to cover you with his blood.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Anybody want to accept that?
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   And if you accept that, please come down the aisle,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   and if you come down, we'll give you a free Bible,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   and you are saved.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   Hopefully, you'll make it to church.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Hopefully, you'll be a follower of Jesus Christ.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   And so we have a generation filled with people who have accepted Jesus Christ
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   but never truly repented.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   You will never find any language in the scripture where the gospel is presented
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   and at the end of the presence of the gospel where it says,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   "Do you want to give him a chance?"
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Would you accept Jesus?
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   It's not in the Bible.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Every place where the word of God is taught, where the gospel is presented,
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   it concludes by saying, "Repent and be baptized."
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   That's what John the Baptist preached.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   That's what Jesus preached.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   And that's what the apostles preached.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Repent and be baptized.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   Repentance basically is another word for saying what Jesus is saying here.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   Repentance isn't simply saying, "You know, I lied.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   I shouldn't have lied.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   I stole.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   I shouldn't have stole."
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Repentance basically is saying you are pursuing a life where you are at the center.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Our whole rebellion is a pursuit of what we covet.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   That's why Satan fell.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   That's why Adam and Eve fell.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   It's the rebellion of mankind where he wants to take the place where only God can sit.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   And so repentance is recognizing that my whole pursuit in life was for me.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   And so I repent of the direction that I was headed,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   and now I am headed toward Christ to make him my king.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   That's why he says you must repent.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   Not just repent of an act.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Not just repent of a thought.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Repentance of our whole pursuit.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   If you look at the Ten Commandments,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   every single one of these commandments, at the root of it, is our coveting.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   The first commandment, "You shall have no other gods before me."
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Why would the Jewish community ever even be tempted to worship other gods?
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   I mean, do you ever see the idols of the Old Testament?
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   They're as ugly as you can get.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   It's just like a piece of wood that just carved out.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   It's just a piece of stick.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   And they worship it.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Why were they tempted to worship these idols?
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Obviously, it wasn't the appearance.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   It was periods when they were going through a drought, or they faced an enemy,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   or they weren't getting what they wanted.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Something that they were coveting wasn't getting.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   And then it looks like the Canaanites have it, but we don't have it.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Their field is growing wild, but we don't have anything.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   And so they decide, since God's not answering our prayer,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   maybe their god is better for us.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   So every time they turn to an idol is because they coveted something,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   and God wouldn't give it to them.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   The second commandment is, "You shall make no graven images of God."
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Meaning, you may worship Yahweh by name,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   but the Yahweh that you worship is not the Yahweh of the Bible.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   So making a graven image of him is basically calling him Jesus,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   but you attach characteristics of Jesus that doesn't come from the Bible.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   You make him whatever you want him to be.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   And so that's why we have a culture in our generation that would say,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   "Well, my Jesus would never do that. My Jesus would always do this."
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   And yet, they know nothing of the Scripture.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   They've never studied the Bible.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   They've created an image of Jesus that would fit whatever it is that they're coveting.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   And so they make graven images, and at the root of it is their coveting.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   "You shall not take the name of the Lord God in vain."
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   How often do people use his name and say, "God wanted me to do this"?
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   In Christian circles, "God wants me to date you."
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   "God wants me to date you." "God wants me to have this business."
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   "God wants me to have that." And we use the Lord's name in vain
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   because we covet something, and we attach the name of God and make it godly.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   That's what the third commandment is, using his name in vain.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   But the root of that commandment is coveting.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   They want something, and so the God of the Bible is not answering them.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   So I create a God in the name of the God of the Bible, but it has nothing to do with him.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   "Keep the Sabbath day holy." Why is he saying to separate it?
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Because all other days to separate and devote it to God.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   But because they covet whatever it is that they can get from work, they refuse.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   "Honor your father and your mother."
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   Why does dissension and hatred and discord happen in the family?
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   Because the child is coveting something that the parents are not going to give them, so they rebel.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   "You shall not murder." James makes that very clear.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   You covet what you do not have, so it leads to arguments and then ultimately even to murder.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   "You shall not commit adultery."
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   "You covet someone else's wife." "You shall not steal."
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   "You covet what they have."
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   "You shall not bear witness against your neighbor."
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   And you covet your own reputation and how you are viewed.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   And then finally he says, "You shall not covet."
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   And every single one of the Ten Commandments, at the root of it, is because we have desires that are unmet.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   We want something. So we rebel, we lie, we steal, we slander, and ultimately even choose our own God.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   Even in the church, even in the church, we call his name Jesus.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   But oftentimes the Jesus that Christians call looks nothing like the Scripture.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   That Jesus of the health and wealth gospel, and oftentimes even Bible teaching churches,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   doesn't look anything like what we see in Scripture.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   When he tells us, "If you want to follow me, you must deny yourself,"
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   it is a call to repentance, to bear fruit in accordance to repentance.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   To not simply say, "I won't do this, this, or this," but it's to surrender our life.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   Metanoia. Repent means to change the direction of my life.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   It's not simply, "I'm going to keep going down this direction, but I'm going to make some adjustments."
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   No, that's not repentance. That may be sanctification, but that's not repentance.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   Repentance is my whole pursuit. I was at the center of my whole pursuit.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   It is my happiness that I was most concerned about.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   I am the king of my world, and I repent of that.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   And I acknowledge you as my Lord and Savior.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   So when he says, "If you want to come after me, he must deny himself," it's just another call to genuine repentance.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   Not just simple words, not just raising of hands, but to turn from a self-centered, self-pursuing life to pursue him.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   Galatians 2.20 says, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   My old life is dead, but Christ lives in me, and the life which I now live in the flesh.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me."
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   I didn't simply add Jesus to my life. The old life is gone.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   When Christ was crucified on the cross, he lived a life that I could not live.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   But when he was crucified, we were crucified with him.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Our old life is gone, and so now we live a new life.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   And that's why every time somebody gets baptized, we ask them, "Do you understand that when you go into the water, you are being buried?"
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   You're being buried. You're not just getting wet.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   And that's why we believe that this is the biblical teaching of true baptism.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Because symbolically, you are dying with Christ, and then when you are coming out of the water,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   you are saying you're being united to the resurrected life of Christ.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   But an individual who continues to live his life independently for his own pursuit,
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   other than the fact that he attends church, other than the fact that he says,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   "You know, I believe that this is who Jesus is," cannot claim to follow Jesus.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   Imagine if two people are getting married, and they're entering into a covenant.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   And in a traditional Christian wedding, and less and less people are doing this now,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   but in a traditional Christian wedding, you have the mothers come in and they light two candles,
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   representing the two families where the children are coming from.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   And then they would light the candle in the middle, and then what do they do?
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   They blow out the other two. What does that symbolize?
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   That now, the two independent lives are becoming one, and so there's a part of the ceremony.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   He says, "What God has put together, let no man separate."
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   For the purpose of this union, he says, "You all leave and cleave to each other."
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   Can you imagine if two people come into a covenant and they say,
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   "You know what? We're going to get married, but I'm going to have everything that I had before I got married.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   You know, I love playing basketball. I used to play six times a week, and I'm going to maintain that."
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   Or say, "You know what? I'm so used to just using the money any time, any way that I want,
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   and I hope that doesn't change."
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   Now, I could already tell you, if in marriage counseling, if any of you said that,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   we would cancel that wedding right there.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   But I can guarantee you 100% you're going to have a hard time in your wedding.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   When two people come together, you're basically saying that you're going to put away your old life,
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   and then you're going to learn to become one.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   You don't have to put away things that you cannot bring to this covenant.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   When we become followers of Jesus Christ, we enter into covenant marriage relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   You cannot retain your old life and then add Jesus.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   That's why the Bible says, "If you are in Christ, the old has passed away. Behold, the new has come."
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   So to be a follower of Jesus Christ, to be in union with Christ, He says first you must deny yourself.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   You must take up the cross daily.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   Whenever we study this text, and I'm sure you've heard it many times, we try to contextualize this.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   Like, what does the cross mean to you?
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   And so I've heard people say, "You know, my cross is my husband because he's so lazy.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   I mean, he doesn't take away the trash. That's my cross I need to bear."
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   And the husband would say, "You know, my wife is my cross because she nags me every day.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   And every day I've got to pick up my cross. And I'm not saying that it isn't."
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   They say, "You know, I'm going to bear it, and I'm going to do the right things. I'm going to pick up my cross."
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   But before we get into the application of how it's applied today, we need to understand the context.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   When Jesus said this, the literal cross was down the street for Him when He said this.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   He's about eight months away from experiencing the most excruciating pain,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   a torture device that was made up and practiced in order to deter any rebellion against the Roman government.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   He had that in mind, and He's preparing His disciples that, "I'm headed down this way,
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   and if you don't deny yourself, if you don't pick up your cross, you're not going to be able to follow Me."
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   As you and I know, that's exactly what happened.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   Jesus was about to go to the cross, and Peter could not comprehend.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   "You are the Christ of God. You're here to make everything right.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   You're here to feed the hungry, to heal the sick, to raise the dead.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   I don't understand why you would go to the cross."
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   So when Jesus told them that He's going to head to the cross, Peter, in Matthew 16, 22, takes Him aside and rebukes Him.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   Now, I want you to understand the boldness of what's happening, the arrogance of Apostle Paul.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   He's the one who confessed to Jesus, "You are the Christ, the Son of the God."
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   It's that Peter who made that confession, "You're God. You're the Son of God.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   You're the one that all the prophets and all the forefathers have been prophesying, but Jesus."
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   Let me set you straight. Let me tell you how this world works.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   And he turns aside, he says, in verse 22, "Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke the Son of God.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   'God forbid it, Lord. This shall never happen to you.'"
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   Let me stop right here. As arrogant as this may sound,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   you know how many times confessing Christians try to correct Jesus?
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   You can't possibly mean what you say here.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   There's no way that that is meant to be applied here.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   Maybe it meant that 2,000 years ago, but it can't mean that today.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   You don't think that's just as arrogant to come to the Word of God and say,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   "Maybe it was relevant then. It's no longer relevant today."
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   This is our version of Peter.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   "But he turned and said to Peter, 'Get behind me, Satan.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on God's interest, but man's.'"
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   So you're not thinking about the kingdom. You're not thinking about me.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   You're not thinking about His mission. You're thinking about you.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   You're thinking about this kingdom.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   You're thinking about the life that you worked so hard to build,
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   and you are hoping that I would make it better.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   Christ says, "You have no idea what's about to happen."
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   So initially, when Jesus went to the cross, they all ran,
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   because it didn't make any sense.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   How can He fulfill my dreams?
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   How can He lift us up to sit on the left and to the right if He goes to the cross?
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   How can He be that Messiah of Isaiah 61 that He said was going to be fulfilled?
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   Injustice will be taken care of. The sick will be healed. The prisoners will be released.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   How can you go to the cross and fulfill that?
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   Because of that, they ran.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   And just like Jesus warned them,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   "If you don't deny yourself and take up your cross daily, you cannot follow me."
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   So the immediate context that Jesus was telling them was literal.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   And that's exactly what happened to the disciples.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   Peter was crucified upside down.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   Andrew was crucified.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Simon the Zealot was crucified.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   James was beheaded by King Herod.
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   John was thrown into a burning pot of oil, survived,
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   and then lived out the rest of his life in misery and pain,
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   and ended up writing the book of Revelation.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   Philip died hanging in Turkey.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   Bartholomew was flayed to death in India.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   Thomas was killed in India.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   James, the son of Aphaeus, was stoned to death.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   Thaddeus was shot to death by arrows in Persia.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   Matthew also gave his life, but we don't know exactly the method.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   Every single one of them suffered severely.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   So when Jesus said to them, "If you don't deny yourself and pick up your cross daily and follow me,
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.000]   you will not be able to follow me," because that's where he's headed.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   The only one that wasn't martyred was Judas.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   Judas could not understand the cross.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   Why is he going to the cross?
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   So in his attempt to salvage three years of his life,
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   he sold Jesus for 30 pieces of silver, which was the price of a slave at that time.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   But guess what?
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   After selling, and once he came to his senses, he ended up hanging himself.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   So they all died.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   All of them died.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   But the difference between the disciples and Judas was Judas,
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   in his attempt to live better, to salvage something,
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   he ended up dying anyway and went to eternal judgment.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   All the other disciples also died.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   But at the end of their life was glory waiting for them.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   See, when he tells us to deny ourselves, he's saving us from ourselves.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   In Luke 9, 24-25, it said, "For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it,
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   but whoever loses his life for my sake, he is the one who will save it.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   For what is a man profit if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?"
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   You see, living in this fallen world, we are deceived.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   The things that we think is going to cause better life, it actually produces death.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   Let me give you some examples.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   When social media was created, why was it created?
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   It's called social media.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   It's to help people connect, right?
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   People on college campuses, to help them connect,
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   and people from this neighborhood, that neighborhood to connect,
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   people from country to country to connect.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   And so social media in every format was created to bring the world together.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   But in every study since social media, what has happened?
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   There's more isolation, more loneliness, more division than ever before.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   The very thing that was supposed to cause community and utopia has done exactly the opposite.
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   Think about our passions and our desires.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   We eat. We have to eat to live.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   But what has eating done to us?
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   Eating is killing us.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   The very thing that was created for the purpose of giving us life,
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   and in a rich country, is the largest source of health problems in our culture.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   You know, people after work, you know, you're so fatigued and tired,
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   and because you're tired, you sit there and veg,
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   and then you watch television, and next thing you know, you're too tired,
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   so you've got to go to sleep, and then you wake up next day,
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   and then you're tired, and then your fatigue causes you to rest,
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   and the solution to that is to exercise.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   But our natural desire to rest, ultimately, is what's leading to death.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   I'm going to give you some more examples.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   You know, people who desire to be noticed,
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   and they want to be recognized, are the hardest people to follow.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   If you raise a child to be the center of the universe, and your whole goal,
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   every decision you make is you want to make your child happy,
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   what's going to happen to that child?
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   You're going to ruin that child.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   Because as soon as you are gone, as soon as they are grown,
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   they're going to be a difficult person to be around.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   And so what you've created was a child who is very difficult to love and accept.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   And so your desire to give them a better life is ruining them.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   Let me give you a final example.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   50, 60 years ago, Korea, China, Japan, Taiwan were all very, very poor countries.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   And in one generation, they've had so much money pour into these countries,
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   and they have become one of the wealthiest countries in the world.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   Every single one of them, if their birth rate doesn't turn around in 30 years,
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   they said, "The country itself is just going to dissolve,"
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   because they don't have enough children being born.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   And you could see that visually in Japan.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   You're starting to notice that in Korea and China and in Taiwan.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   And if you ask every single one of them, "Why aren't you guys having children?"
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   the typical answer that they will give is, "Because we can't afford it."
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   Because the life that they want to have, if you bring a child into that,
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   they're not going to be able to give them what we think they need.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   And so as a result of their pursuit of this level of convenience,
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   it's destroying their countries.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   What we think is going to bring life, ultimately, our pursuit is killing us.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   So when he says, "If you want to come after me, deny yourself and pick up your cross,"
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   he's actually telling us that what you think is going to bring life is what's causing the death.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   The coveting in your heart is causing you to run away from God, to reject Him.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   What does dying to yourself look like in our culture?
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   Denying the desire to be recognized, that coveting in your heart to be somebody,
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   the need to slander back when somebody slanders you, that's hard.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   Loving someone that doesn't love you.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   You can be in the church and surround yourself with friends, with people that you like.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   And anybody that makes you feel uncomfortable, you won't tolerate it.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   But our very identity, the Bible says, is the love that we practice, that He practiced with us.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   Serving someone without anybody noticing.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   You know, how much of the service, when we are doing it to be recognized,
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   eventually leads to a greater bitterness.
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   Because we serve to be recognized, and when we don't get recognized,
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   whatever good you did ends up turning ugly.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   Because even the service was self-centered.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   Having integrity when there doesn't seem to be any tangible immediate benefit,
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   just simply because our God is holy.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   Whatever that may be, an individual who avoids suffering at all costs will suffer because of that.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   Now let me ask you, why would anybody want to follow this Jesus?
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   The Jesus that's presented in our generation is He loves you unconditionally.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   You don't deserve it, so He died for you.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   And so if you want to accept Him, raise your hand, come down to the aisle, give you a Bible, you're good!
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   Now hopefully you'll behave, hopefully you'll have some integrity, hopefully you'll be able to love people.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   But you're not saved by that, so go live your life, fulfill your dreams, and hopefully Jesus will help you.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000]   Who wouldn't want that?
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   Even if you're an atheist, you hope that that God exists.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   Even if all the evidence points to the fact that maybe He doesn't exist,
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   but even if you're an atheist, who wouldn't want that?
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   I really hope that that God that you are telling me exists, because I want that God.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   But the God who says, "If you want to follow me, deny yourself. Pick up your cross daily."
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   Who wants to follow that Jesus?
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   Who wants to come to a church that is preaching this?
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   The problem is, if you look at the Scripture, that's exactly what He's preaching.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   That's exactly what He's preaching.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   You tell me otherwise.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   You search the Scripture to see if He's saying anything else.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   The reason why people reject this is because they think somehow that what Jesus says is preventing me from having an abundant life.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   When Jesus is telling us the abundant life is being prevented because you're pursuing your own life outside of Christ.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   When He tells us to pick up our cross and to deny ourselves,
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   He's telling us to move away from the very things that are killing you.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   To pick up and follow Him.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   There are two things that need to be in order for this to be true.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   Who would want to follow this Jesus?
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   One, you would only follow this Jesus if you actually believe what He says.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   You have to have genuine faith.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   Otherwise, you're going to pick and choose what you want.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   You're going to create a Jesus of your own.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   But if you want to follow the Jesus of the Bible, you have to actually believe what He says.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   When He says in Romans 8 24-25, "For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   For who hopes for what he already sees?
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance we wait eagerly for it."
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   If you don't believe that, if you don't believe that there's true hope waiting for us after we die,
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   why would we sacrifice anything here?
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   Only those who genuinely believe that the promises that Jesus made is true.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   And who He said He was. 2 Corinthians 4 17-18.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   "For momentary light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal."
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   If you don't believe that, you confess, "Yes, Jesus died on the cross.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   He was resurrected and then He died for my sins.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   And so I have eternal life in Him." Right?
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   The difference between a Christian and the devil is not his theology.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   It is not his theology.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   See, the devil didn't repent.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   A Christian repented.
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   Why did we repent?
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   Because I believe in the promises that Christ made.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   Because I believe Him.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:38.000]   I believe Him that even in the suffering there's greater glory waiting for me.
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   But the second reason why somebody would follow this Jesus
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   is that you see the beauty in Christ above every other temptation.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   In Matthew 13-44 it says, "The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field which a man found and hid it again.
[00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   And from joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field."
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   He's making a trade.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   He's trading a lesser glory that he's been tempted by all his life for a greater glory in Christ.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   Because he sees the treasure in Christ.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   The treasure that is Christ worth selling everything to follow Him.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   But if you don't believe that, if you don't see the treasure in Christ, how can you follow this Jesus?
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.000]   All you're going to hear, if you don't believe that, if you don't know that, is to suffer for Jesus.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   That's all you're going to hear.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   The thing that you want, you can't have it.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   You need to discipline yourself to make sure that you don't get what you want.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   The things that make you happy, don't have it.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   That's all you hear.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   But if you have seen and tasted the goodness of God,
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   then what He's telling us is to let go.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   Let go of the rubbish so that you can have the treasure in Christ.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   Matthew 13-45-46, "Again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   and upon finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it."
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   If Jesus is not your treasure, Jesus becomes your servant to get your treasure.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   Then eventually when Jesus doesn't give you the treasure that you want, you end up questioning Him.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   You become bitter at Him and then eventually you will leave Him.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   Because if Jesus is not your treasure, Jesus will become your servant.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   And if the servant doesn't listen to what I want, then I don't need Him as my servant anymore.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   Is He your King or is He your servant?
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   That's the difference between a Christian who confesses and is not following Christ, but a genuine disciple of Jesus.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   That's why Apostle Paul says with all that he had, I mean, Apostle Paul was living a good life.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   Roman citizen, highly educated, maybe already famous even before he met Jesus.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   Had the highest scholar as his teacher, a Roman citizen.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   And then he spent a huge chunk of his time being beaten, stoned, sitting in prison,
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   and eventually beheaded because he met Jesus.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   Because he met Jesus.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   And yet he says, in light of the surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ,
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   all of that stuff, I don't regret it.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   I don't regret it.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   I had a friend back in high school.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   We weren't good friends, we just knew each other.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   He ran in a crowd that I did not run in, which was, he was very studious.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   So he was the top of his class.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   He was that valedictorian of the year that I graduated.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   And he ended up making it to Stanford, right?
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   And even back then, Stanford was like, you can get into UCLA, Berkeley, but you made it to Stanford.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   Whoa, he made it to Stanford.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   So he got into Stanford, and then, you know, obviously we all, he was like the talk of our class.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   And, you know, he went to Stanford, and then we heard that by his second year,
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   sophomore year, he made it to the dean's list at Stanford.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   You have to understand, Stanford back in the '80s,
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   like this is when the computer stuff was just coming around.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   So, I mean, if you graduated Stanford with a computer degree, I mean,
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   you know, that's why all those Silicon Valley guys are making all this kind of money.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   And so he made it to Stanford, and people were saying,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   wow, this guy, you know, he made the dean's list at Stanford sophomore year.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   And then about a year later, we found out that he dropped out of school.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   So why did he drop out of school?
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   And found out that he gave up everything, and he became a full-time missionary.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   And we've never heard from him since.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   I don't know where he went.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   I don't know.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   But I remember all my classmates graduated were talking about this fool.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   What did he do?
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   Did something happen?
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   Did he get somebody pregnant?
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   What happened?
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   Because they couldn't understand why would somebody who had all of that drop everything.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   And a lot of times, even in the church, people would say, what a fool.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   He's just finished, and you can make all this money, and then climb the ladder,
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   become a multibillionaire, and you can use that platform to preach about Christ.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   Because they don't understand.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   Why would Apostle Paul give up everything and die preaching Christ?
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   Why would this guy who was on top of the world and had possibly a multimillionaire
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   give up all of that so that he can live the rest of his life preaching Christ?
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   If you have not met the resurrected Lord, and if you've not seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   you will not understand.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   I can explain it to you.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   You can hear someone else's testimony.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   You can admire Jesus from a distance, but you won't understand his decision.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:11.000]   Why would you drop everything and live your life suffering in a foreign country,
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   speaking a strange language, raising your children in a difficult area?
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   For what reason?
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   This command of Jesus only would make sense, or even attempt to practice it,
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   if you believe what Jesus says.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   And Jesus is a greater treasure in your life than anything else in this world.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   The goal of this church is to help you to see that,
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   not to simply change your behavior, not to simply so that you can have better theology,
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   it's so that you can recognize the beauty of Christ.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   That just like Apostle Paul, in light of the beauty of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   the treasure that we have found in Christ,
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   that all of a sudden everything else in this world becomes rubbish.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   And honoring him, glorifying him, proclaiming him,
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   becomes a central passion of every single follower of Jesus Christ.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   If all we did was cause you to attend church,
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   if all we did is cause you to study the Bible,
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   if all we did was to cause you to be just better people,
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   then you've missed the whole point.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   Jesus said, "If you want to follow after me, deny yourself.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   Pick up your cross daily and follow me."
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   Let's pray.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   Heavenly Father, we pray that the power of your word would continue to lead us and guide us,
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   restore us and challenge us and sanctify us.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   Help us to be the church that you have created it to be,
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   that you've suffered for, that you've established,
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   and that you've promised that the gates of Hades would not be able to prevail against it.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   Help us, Lord God, as the world becomes darker and darker,
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   that our love for you would not become cold,
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   but our passion would grow even stronger,
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   that the light that you have called us to be would burn brightly,
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   that the world may know that you are a living Christ,
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   that hope is in you and life is in you and you alone.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.

[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:32.660]   Philippians chapter three, verses 12.
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:34.140]   Not that I have already obtained it
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:35.640]   or have already become perfect,
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:38.000]   but I press on so that I may lay hold of that
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.240]   for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.700]   Brethren, I do not regard myself
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:45.300]   as having laid hold of it yet,
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:48.100]   but one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.760]   and reaching toward what lies ahead.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:53.060]   I press on toward the goal for the prize
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:55.780]   of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:58.140]   Let us therefore as many as are perfect
[01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:00.500]   have this attitude, and if in anything
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:01.660]   you have different attitude,
[01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:04.180]   God will reveal it also to you.
[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:06.780]   However, let us keep living by that same standard
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:08.720]   to which we have attained.
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:13.420]   Father, we ask, Lord God, that your glory
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:17.520]   and your life would be at the center of our pursuit.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.180]   I pray that all the distractions,
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:21.340]   all the temptations, and all the coveting,
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:27.820]   Lord, would be completely in light of knowing Jesus Christ.
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:32.060]   It would truly become rubbish that we may live our life,
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:35.540]   this week in particular, for the sake of your glory.
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.220]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
