[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280]   Okay, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 13.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:18.480]   We're going to finish up this text, verse 17 to 19.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.600]   First, Hebrews chapter 13, verse 17 to 19.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.400]   It says, "Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.120]   as those who will give an account.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.160]   Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.760]   Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a good conscience, desiring to conduct ourselves
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.600]   honorably in all things.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.800]   And I urge you all the more to do this so that I may be restored to you sooner."
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.800]   Let's pray.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.040]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.760]   We pray that your word would illuminate us, help us to see a greater glimpse of who you
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.400]   are, that we may submit ourselves, Lord God, to your word, and that your word and your
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.640]   glory will be at the center of this church.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.160]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.680]   I want to read you a poem that I wrote when I was 23.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.000]   Okay, so it's been many years ago.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.640]   And basically I wrote this in a period of discouragement, just to kind of remind myself
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.960]   to give me strength to persevere.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.560]   And basically the poem goes like this.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.560]   I have come too far to retreat, to remain in my defeat.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.620]   I have no other paths to take, for there are too many things at stake.
[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.640]   My soul thirsts to see the only king, to finally know the joy and peace he'll bring.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.640]   The light will fill the darkness everywhere, nothing that I know will compare.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.400]   Though I've fallen more than I can remember, my thoughts go back to that night in December
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.280]   when my soul was snatched from the fire and the only king filled all my desires.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.320]   Not by works, but by grace I will meet.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.600]   I've come too far to retreat.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.080]   I don't even remember the context in writing that, but I do remember the discouragement
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.880]   and thinking to myself, like just kicking and screaming, like I don't want to do pastoral
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.880]   ministry.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.880]   You know, I'll be a missionary.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.880]   I'll be on campus and I'll do whatever else, but pastoral ministry.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.420]   Because every pain and every bad memory that I have with childhood was somehow connected
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.340]   to church because my dad was a pastor.
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.520]   And so when I knew going in that that was going to come, but when it actually started
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.900]   happening and we started, the discouragement started to come, the interpersonal relational
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.880]   conflict started to come, it wasn't just about that thing.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.800]   It was just all the stuff that I remember was, am I ready for this?
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.880]   Do I want to take my kids through this?
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.320]   Do I want to take my wife in this?
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.080]   And so as I was wrestling through that, I just, you know, back then I used to write
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.240]   songs and write poems, and I haven't done that in years.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:10.840]   But as I was writing that, looking back at it now, only if I knew what was coming, I
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.280]   wouldn't have been able to persevere.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.520]   But what I'm thankful for is that because I saw it in my parents, that at least I had
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.480]   some inkling, I had some idea.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.240]   I wasn't necessarily caught off guard.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.160]   It didn't make it like easy, but at least I knew what was coming.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.800]   I knew what I was getting into.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.200]   Many, many years have gone by since then, 30 years have gone by since I wrote that poem,
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.640]   30 some years.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.040]   And again, by God's providence, he only gives you enough to know at that moment.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.440]   If you know what's coming, how many of us would be able to persevere?
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.600]   Whatever it is that you're doing, God gives us the strength that we need to persevere
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   at that moment.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.880]   You know, as we were going through this text, obviously we started out by understanding
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.320]   the biblical calling of leaders in the church, the very high calling in the church.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.560]   And so we take this very, very seriously, sometimes to the point where people are frustrated
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.160]   that we need to have a very high view of the church.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.040]   Doesn't mean that the leadership is perfect, that they don't make mistakes, but at least
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.320]   by our standard, we need to have a very high standard.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.040]   Because if the leaders are compromised, automatically the church will be compromised.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.880]   Along with that, he said, if the leaders are committed to that, the congregation needs
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.080]   to commit to the leadership.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.000]   And so last week we looked at to obey and submit.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.280]   Obey and submit basically means to place yourself under, make it easier for them to lead you
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.040]   and sacrifice for you and pray for you, because it is to your benefit, because God has put
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.840]   the leaders in charge to watch over the souls of the congregation.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:58.800]   Today's sermon is a lot more personal, because I'm basically asking for prayer this morning.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.680]   I'm very encouraged that we have a church that's praying for our leadership.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.480]   I get an email from our sister Helen once a month, representing the family ministry,
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.120]   saying, "Hey, you have any prayer requests?"
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:17.000]   And so most of the prayer requests that I give probably looks the same as the previous
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.320]   months because a lot of things that we get entangled with is kind of hard to share.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.720]   And so we have to sift through what can I share, what can I not share.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:33.120]   But today I wanted to share, representing all the leadership, and this is not just us,
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.160]   so that you can kind of get a better glimpse of what leadership struggles with, and so
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.240]   that when you do pray for us, you can pray for us in more detail, more accurately.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.760]   The prayer request falls into two categories here.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.360]   When Paul says in verse 18, "Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a good conscience,
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.520]   desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things."
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.480]   So the first thing is to pray for our own sanctification.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.120]   Pray for the sanctification and maturity and growth and wrestling with sins in ourselves
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.080]   first, in the leadership.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.920]   Second, to pray for the ministry.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.600]   He says, "I urge you all the more to do this so that I may be restored to you the sooner."
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.880]   Paul, his ministry, his prayer is always kind of centered around his ministry.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.520]   "Give me boldness that the doors may be opened and the gospel may spread rapidly."
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.600]   And so that's the second part.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.160]   So the first part, when he says, "Pray for us, knowing that we have a good conscience,
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.280]   desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things."
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.400]   When he says to pray for that they would have a good conscience, and then he says to conduct
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.200]   ourselves honorably in all things, he's talking about sanctification inside and out.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.000]   On the surface, because this is our job, we have to study the Bible.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.400]   We have to do counseling, we do evangelism, and so everything that pertains to running
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.840]   the church, we can do and be completely a different person internally.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:09.680]   In fact, Pharisees were the godliest people on the surface, probably more than majority
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.980]   of the people in our generation.
[00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.440]   They studied the Bible more than, they memorized the Bible.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.960]   They went witnessing.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.960]   They gave.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.960]   They tithed.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.360]   They did everything that you're supposed to.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.960]   They prayed.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.960]   They fasted.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.200]   And yet when Jesus rebuked them, he said, "You are no different than a whitewashed
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.200]   tomb."
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.400]   Meaning that on the surface, you clean it so that it looks beautiful, but inside it's
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.500]   just filled with dead men's bones.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:43.680]   On the surface, as a job, we can preach and teach and evangelize and counsel and do all
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.680]   that thing.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:50.920]   But if we're not careful, we can ignore our conscience, where we can do all these
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:58.760]   things and make disciples, but inwardly, we are filled with pride, greed, bitterness,
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:04.960]   anger, slander, and we excuse all of that because people don't know about that.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.840]   If I don't tell you, if we don't confess it, you would not know.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.360]   If I don't share that and ask for prayers, you wouldn't know.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.040]   So we can do the work on the external because we're concerned because there's immediate
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:23.120]   consequences if we don't get the external things correctly while ignoring our conscience.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.160]   Paul says, "Pray for us because we are trying hard to have a good conscience and desiring
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.240]   with all our might to conduct honorably."
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:40.920]   This is one thing that you just cannot do unless there is righteousness inside and outside.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:46.120]   Everybody, I mean, you guys are all in different fields, right?
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.320]   If you're a business owner, there's a special kind of skill that you need to make the food,
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:56.080]   to advertise, to manage the money, manage the workers, and especially during the pandemic,
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.080]   you had all kinds of things that you needed to do in order to keep it running.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.040]   Well, on the surface, the church is no different.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.160]   I don't think on the surface, the church is more difficult because there's a lot of
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.160]   things that we can do on the surface, right?
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.160]   If you're a good manager, if you're good with people, maybe you're a good teacher,
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.400]   we can do all of these things.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.240]   But you cannot bear fruit because the Bible says that you cannot bear fruit unless you
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.640]   abide in me.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:32.200]   Unless there is an abiding that is taking place in the leadership, in conscience, and
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.320]   in conduct, he says you cannot bear fruit.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:42.160]   We can fake it, we can get you to maybe thank us and adore us, but the real fruit that comes
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:48.880]   from the conviction of the Holy Spirit isn't going to happen unless the leaders themselves
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.040]   have a clear conscience before God, inside and out.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.040]   Paul says in Acts 24, verse 16, "In view of this, I also do my best to maintain always
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:03.440]   a blameless conscience before God and before men."
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.640]   And then in 1 Peter 3, verse 16, it says, "Keep a good conscience so that in the thing
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:11.800]   in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.800]   shame."
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:20.520]   He said the reason why leaders have to be above reproach is because we have the job,
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.720]   and again, this isn't unique to us.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.440]   The whole church, every single Christian is called to make disciples, but the leaders
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.400]   are to be an example of this.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:34.600]   So we have the job of proclaiming the gospel that basically tells the world that all have
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.760]   sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:44.240]   That you need to repent and humble yourself before this King, and until you turn from
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:50.020]   the empty way of life, there is no salvation, there is no hope beyond this life.
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.920]   So if you believe that, then I've turned you away from your sin to eternal life.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:01.920]   But if you do not believe that, then I've offended you, because I just call your whole
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.520]   way of life empty.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:10.280]   That you are deep in sin, and that there is eternal judgment waiting for you.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:16.240]   So this message that we've been given to preach to this fallen world is a very offensive
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.500]   message if they do not believe, if they do not receive it.
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:25.280]   So because if the people do not receive it, the natural response is going to be, "Well,
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.720]   who the heck are you to tell me that?"
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.700]   So we invite criticism.
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.780]   We invite reviling.
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:39.880]   I think maybe another way to put it is, if somebody comes into your room early in the
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.480]   morning and they flip the light on, right, it's still dark, five in the morning, they
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:48.020]   flip the light on, how will you respond?
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.100]   It depends, right?
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.560]   You have a job at 5.30, and if you don't get there in time, then you're going to lose this
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.560]   job.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.260]   So if somebody comes in and flicks the light on, thank you, because if you didn't do that,
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:03.620]   I would have just slept through, and I would have lost this job.
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:08.260]   You may respond that way depending on the context and what you believe and why they
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.260]   did that.
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.300]   But let's say it's Saturday morning, you know what I mean?
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:17.500]   And you woke up early all week, and then the only day you have to sleep in is Saturday,
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.220]   and maybe the person flicking the light on forgot that was the case, and they flipped
[00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.220]   the light on.
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.220]   How would you respond?
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.940]   "Thank you, I know you meant well."
[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:28.300]   Okay, can you please turn that off, right?
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.300]   Maybe.
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.180]   "What are you doing?"
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.180]   Especially if that's your sibling, right?
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:38.820]   "Saturday's the only day I was able to sleep in, the best dream of my life, and you woke
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:39.820]   me up.
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.100]   What are you doing, you jerk?"
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.260]   The kind of response that you're going to get when the light gets turned on, it depends
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.700]   on what the light does for you.
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:55.140]   Does it wake you up to save you, to get you to the place you need to go?
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:59.700]   Or is it disturbing you, or where you want to stay?
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.140]   That's exactly what the gospel does.
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:05.980]   When you turn the light on, it'll cause you to get you to move from where you are to somewhere
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.980]   else, but if you don't want to move, the gospel is very disturbing.
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.100]   It's irritating.
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.060]   It's offensive.
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:18.180]   And so because of that, if the elders were called to preach the gospel, flick the light
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:25.100]   on, some people will thank us, and many will find ways to accuse us.
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:30.540]   So if the leaders of the church are not above reproach, and that thing gets turned around
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:36.700]   and say, "Well, look at you," and if any of that sticks, they nullify the message because
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.860]   they've nullified the messenger.
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:46.300]   In 1 Timothy 1.5 it says, "But the goal of our instruction is love."
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.860]   The goal of our instruction is love.
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:54.260]   Right before this text, Apostle Paul tells Timothy to go fight against these false teachers,
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.260]   command them to stop teaching these false doctrines.
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.300]   So he's telling Timothy to gear up for this fight.
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:06.260]   But as he is commanding him to do that, he says, "Remember that even in the midst of
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.500]   this fight, the goal of it is love."
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.020]   The goal of it, the reason why we're fighting is so that we can establish love.
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:19.540]   But he says, "But from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith."
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:24.880]   In order to be effective in this struggle to keep the truth, we need to have our eyes
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.660]   on the reason why we're doing that, that Christ came and says what characterized us as disciples
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.980]   of Christ is love.
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:38.540]   And what I've experienced through the years is when I'm not doing right, and I don't have
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:46.300]   a clear conscience, the first thing that is impossible to do is to love people.
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:53.900]   It takes every ounce of energy in me because it takes so much out to love people that I
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.820]   don't want to love.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.220]   It's easy to seek justice.
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.380]   You did me wrong, so you deserve this.
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.220]   It's easy to do that.
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:08.040]   You hurt me, so I'm going to hurt you because that's our natural reflex.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:14.660]   But to pray for them, to seek what's best, to do your best to love them, it goes against
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.660]   my nature.
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:19.940]   So it's nothing more humbling that we can do in the flesh than to love somebody that
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.780]   you do not want to love.
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.340]   It requires a good conscience.
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.900]   I don't know how many times I'm on my knees just being broken because everything in my
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.020]   flesh is fighting against this.
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.820]   But I know that if I don't practice this, that whatever sermon that I give, that I'm
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.040]   a fake.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:48.660]   I present the facade of loving Christ, that this is the most important thing, and it's
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:52.500]   with my mouth, but not with my life.
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:57.020]   There's a huge difference between a sermon that you hear from the mouth versus a sermon
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.820]   you hear from their life.
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:06.540]   And a leader cannot do this until his conscience is clear, inside and out.
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.140]   Now who's able to do this?
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:14.500]   This calling for the leadership in the church is not something that we can muster up.
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:19.020]   Are there just few good men who just happen to be good in soul, who just happen to be
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:23.640]   better in intellect, who has more courage than the average person?
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.340]   It's beyond us.
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.860]   We're just like you.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:32.580]   And sometimes because we're in ministry and we have this title of leader or whatever it
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.580]   may be, you're a pastor.
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.620]   It's like, "Oh, your family's like this because you're a pastor.
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.140]   Oh, you struggle, you don't do this because you're a pastor."
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:43.380]   So a lot of times we have to tell our elders, you know, sometimes they follow you more than
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:48.620]   they follow us because our life looks different, right?
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.020]   But we're not any different.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.240]   Every temptation you struggle with, I struggle with.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.000]   You want the best things for your kids.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.160]   So do we.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.840]   You want to live in a nice house instead of a shack.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.060]   Me too, right?
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.520]   You don't want your cars breaking down in the middle of the road.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.000]   Me neither.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.520]   I want to make sure that there's enough to retire on.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.040]   I want to make sure that my wife is taken care of, my kids are taken care of, that I
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.700]   have stuff to leave behind them.
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:19.040]   You struggle with that.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.040]   You're tempted by it.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.000]   So am I.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.840]   I have to constantly fight against my own flesh.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:32.640]   And I'm not saying any of that stuff is wrong, but that's not our priority.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:38.800]   Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and it says, "All these things shall be added unto you."
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.160]   I don't know how many times I've repeated that verse in my own head to fight my own
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.800]   flesh because I'm tempted, you know.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:53.040]   I need money, you know, to make it easier for my mom and for my dad.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.040]   And I remember as a young kid promising, "We're going to make sure that you ride limousine
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.440]   and you're going to get your Cadillac."
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.760]   And, you know, I know Cadillac is not popular now.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.840]   Today's version was, "I'm going to buy you the best Tesla.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.960]   You know, we're going to make sure because you suffered enough."
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.920]   And, you know, just like a lot of the kids do, we did the same thing.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:19.240]   But when we decided to go into ministry, we have to wrestle with that, right?
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.240]   And I had to go against all the promises, right?
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.000]   We're going to have to let that go and give it in God's hand.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.820]   But the temptation has never gone away.
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:34.440]   I never thought that I would, because I don't feel like I'm materialistic, right?
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:40.000]   I think if I went into business, like, I would have been obsessed.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.200]   That's just my personality, you know?
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.480]   But I don't have like this longing to live in a big house, you know?
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:55.600]   In fact, my dream is, you know, Esther knows, is to live in a van, you know?
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:01.360]   Have very little clutter and then just move and just wake up in the morning at the beach.
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:02.360]   You know what I mean?
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.360]   Like that's my dream.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.520]   So I don't have this like big vision of like I want nice things, right?
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:13.200]   But after you have kids, it's different because it's not just me, right?
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.240]   I want my wife to have nice things.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.800]   I want my kids to have nice things.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:24.920]   And I really remember, you know, when we started having kids, the temptation because we didn't,
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.720]   I mean, we really had nothing, like literally nothing.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:32.220]   We had to calculate even to buy groceries.
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:38.000]   And then not having air conditioning in the car when my child was an infant and every
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.400]   time he rode that car, he would come out just in sweat.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:49.080]   And I remember really wrestling with like I wish I had more money, you know?
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.960]   And I had to fight.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.560]   Sikhi first, the kingdom of God.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.240]   And all these things shall be added unto you.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:03.720]   So throughout the years, I had to repeat that in my head because the struggle and the temptation
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:10.080]   to chase after that, you know, is always there.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.080]   It's not gone now.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.180]   You know, it's there.
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:19.720]   But I know that this is not something you can do part time.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:27.760]   Like either I believe it and give my life like Apostle Paul or I do something else.
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:32.600]   Paul says to Timothy, 1 Timothy 1.18, "This command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son,
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:37.480]   in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you fight
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.480]   the good fight."
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:45.640]   He called Timothy to fight, not just to check in and check out.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:51.520]   So the temptation for us as pastors is to approach this like a job, you know?
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.880]   Because you get paid, you do certain things, and then so we do certain, we preach and we
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.160]   manage the church, do counseling, and we get paid, so that's how we take care of our family.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:03.240]   But this is not a ministry that you can do as a job.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.640]   This is a ministry where you have to be called.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.320]   That you need to be consumed with this, that there's nothing more important than to get
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.400]   the gospel out and to establish a church.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.760]   Sometimes you may eat well, sometimes you may not.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.420]   Sometimes the bills are paid, sometimes you are not.
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:24.520]   But if our commitment to this is if we can take care of our family, then we'll do it.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:30.400]   If we can't, we can't, then sooner or later you're going to end up walking away.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.940]   This is not something that you can do just by doing it as a job.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:42.480]   And after years and years of doing this, the temptation for that is very real, right?
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.840]   Especially now that the church is a certain size and we have so many pastors and so many
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:51.600]   people volunteering and helping out, it just kind of runs, right?
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:57.040]   I don't have to like strive in prayer so that Sunday service was going to happen.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.960]   I don't have to wrestle and there's a sense of urgency to get you gathered because you're
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.120]   going to come.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.600]   So the temptation is to just get it done, right?
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:17.120]   But I know when I'm sober that the urgency to get the gospel out is no different whether
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:23.040]   we are a thousand or ten, whether 40 years ago or now.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.320]   It's just that there's a temptation for us to settle.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:31.400]   In fact, Paul says in 2 Timothy 4, 9 through 11, he says, "Make every effort to come to
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:38.000]   me for demons loving this present world have deserted me and gone to Thessalonica.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.840]   Crescent has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.360]   Only Luke is with me."
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.480]   This is the very last letter Paul wrote before he died.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.240]   You know, oftentimes we think of Paul going out, planting all these churches and then
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.320]   he went out in glory.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.240]   He did it.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.480]   Some of the last letters that he wrote was very depressing.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.840]   And for whatever the reason, I gravitate toward those letters the most, 1 Corinthians and
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.160]   2 Timothy.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.960]   Because I see a real man.
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:14.600]   I see a real struggle that he, you can almost say he's like, he's discouraged.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:15.760]   Because they've all gone.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.240]   He said, "Only Luke is with me."
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.280]   And then he's telling his next generation young pastors, "Make sure this doesn't happen
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.320]   to you.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:26.160]   Entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.160]   Don't get entangled with civilian affairs so that you may please the commanding officer."
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.280]   And he's begging with them.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.000]   He's saying this in the context with all these other people.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.280]   Demas is mentioned in Philemon as his co-worker.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.400]   He went through all these trials with him.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.880]   But he says they're about to go.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:49.440]   That's why Paul said in 1 Corinthians 9, 26, "I run in such a way as not without aim.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:54.280]   I box in such a way as not beating the air, but I discipline my body and make it my slave
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:59.440]   so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified."
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.080]   That's Apostle Paul writing that.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.200]   There's a man who was beaten, shipwrecked.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.280]   He was bitten by scorpions.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.600]   He was starving at some point.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:15.600]   And you would think if anybody was sober, if anybody didn't struggle with him, he almost
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.240]   seemed like a Superman.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.760]   And he says, "After I preach to others, I need to discipline my body and make it my
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:31.160]   slave because the temptation to compromise, to give in, is real."
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.280]   We need your prayers because this is beyond us.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:40.160]   This is not something we can do by our own might because we found talented men.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.840]   Oh, these men are more courageous than average people.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.280]   We are not.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.360]   We're not more courageous.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.520]   We are not smarter than other people.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.200]   God convicted us.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:25:00.800]   He opened our eyes, showed us the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and that Christ
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.200]   that we met, we want to tell other people.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.360]   It's not because we're more gifted.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.600]   It wasn't because we were stronger.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.280]   It's not because we're more disciplined.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.960]   We were just convicted.
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:23.140]   So pray for us that our conscience, our life, inside and out, will be pleasing to the Lord.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.520]   We are being sanctified as you are being sanctified.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:30.680]   Secondly, he says, pray for the work.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.680]   Pray for the work.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.000]   Hebrews chapter 13, 19, he says, "I urge you all the more to do this so that I may be restored
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   to you the sooner."
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.400]   Now, I think this is a possible.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.440]   There's a lot of people who think it's Barnabas and various other people, but I've gone through
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:49.320]   this text verse by verse for about five or six times now, and I see traces of his thinking.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.000]   It may not be him.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.720]   Some people believe it is, and some people believe it's somebody else, but I'm going
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.760]   to talk to you like it is.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:05.720]   Apostle Paul had ... He was just one track mind.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:09.600]   Life or death, he needs to preach the gospel.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.960]   Life or death.
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:18.040]   This man, who literally was sitting in prison, and he ended up getting beheaded, and he had
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:22.880]   prophets from God, true prophets, not fake prophets, right?
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.120]   Not prophets who just kind of say this.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.120]   I got this impression.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:30.520]   This is a true prophet who is telling truth, told Paul, "If you go to Jerusalem, you're
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.840]   going to be bound and put into prison."
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.760]   He says, "Not only am I willing to go to prison, I'm willing to die."
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:43.280]   He got on that boat, and he went, and he's sure, just as he said, he got bound, and he
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.760]   started spending his time in prison.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:52.880]   This man almost seems superhuman to us.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:58.880]   He says in Ephesians 6, 19, "Pray for boldness to preach the word in season and out of season."
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:03.360]   If any man had boldness, you would think Apostle Paul had boldness, right?
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:09.840]   Can you think of another person who literally got stoned, dragged out to die, right?
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.760]   And you say, "Oh my gosh."
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:17.960]   The thought that somebody is going to throw one pebble at you probably will keep us away
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.160]   from the doors closed in that village.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:26.280]   When we say, "Lord, open the door for the gospel to enter," oftentimes we're praying
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.640]   for a red carpet to be thrown out.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.680]   "We'll give you this money, all the food's ready.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:36.440]   We have a church there, and here's a pulpit ready, and people are asking for you to come."
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:40.240]   It's like, "Please open the door."
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.920]   This is a guy, when he says, "Open the door," he's talking about people who's trying to
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:47.920]   kill me, help me to stay safe so I can get over there.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:52.720]   And yet, he says, "Pray for boldness."
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:58.600]   I think he's asking for boldness because he was struggling with that, because he's human.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.320]   He remembers the pain of getting hit by rocks.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:06.440]   He remembers not having food to eat.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.560]   He remembers being shipwrecked, almost dying.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.960]   He remembers being whooped to the point of death.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:21.160]   And on top of all of that, his fellow countrymen and the very church that he spent, risked
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:26.240]   everything to plant in Corinth was questioning, "Who are you?"
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:31.000]   Mostly because they didn't like what he had to say, because he came out hard in 1 Corinthians.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.480]   "Shall I come to you with a whip?"
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.920]   He said, "Who are you?"
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.920]   Calling us out, "Who are you?
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.360]   You're not even an apostle.
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:44.040]   Your letters are strong, but your presence is weak."
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:48.640]   And you see 2 Corinthians, he's agonizing, trying to defend his apostleship to the very
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.900]   people that he risked his life to get the gospel to.
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.680]   You think that didn't bother him?
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.760]   You think he just shrugged that off?
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.520]   "I love Jesus, so it doesn't bother me?"
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.840]   No.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:07.200]   He said he prayed to the Lord three times to take the thorn away from his side.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:13.280]   I think, and most commentators believe, that he's referring to his objectors.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.020]   People were constantly, and he says that in Philippians.
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:20.960]   Some people preach Christ out of envy, just to make it harder for him.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.320]   Why would you do that?
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.880]   But Paul says people were doing that.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.860]   Other Christians, professing Christians, were simply preaching the gospel just to make it
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.040]   harder for him.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.840]   Do you think that didn't bother him?
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.840]   He's human.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.240]   You think he didn't agonize before that?
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.240]   And I think he agonized before the Lord.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.240]   Please take that away.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:43.560]   I don't think he was talking about physical suffering.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.080]   I don't think he was talking about being shipped there.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:52.360]   I think he's talking about the people that he loved, that he was agonizing over.
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:57.160]   He says in Colossians 4, 3-4, praying at the same time for us as well, that God will open
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:01.520]   up for us the door for the word, so that we may speak from the mystery of Christ, for
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:05.400]   which I have been imprisoned, so that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:11.040]   The revelation is coming to him, and every pastor, every leader struggles with that.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:15.280]   We know what the word of God says, but how do I make this clear?
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.800]   Paul, the revelation is coming through him.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.280]   He says he's praying, "Make it clear so that I can do a good job presenting the truth."
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.800]   He's a man just like us.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:29.400]   Philippians 1-20, "According to my earnest expectation and hope that I will not be put
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:34.680]   to shame in anything, but that with all boldness Christ, even now, as always, be exalted in
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:38.000]   my body, whether by life or by death."
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.120]   Paul's sitting in prison, possibly about to die, get martyred, and he's asking.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.120]   Pain's coming.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.160]   Struggle is coming.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.360]   Pray for me.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:57.240]   Possibly has fear, concern for the pain, the people he is going to leave behind, and
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:01.440]   the torture that he may experience to get him to deny Christ.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:06.840]   Just like any other human being, he says, "Pray for me so that I don't fail this, whether
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.920]   by life or death."
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.840]   He was a man just like us.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:18.480]   Even Jesus, it was prophesied, prepared.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:23.880]   He deliberately came to die for us, and yet the night before he went to the cross, he
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.920]   prayed to his Father, "Lord, is there any other way?"
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:34.720]   And he agonized in his prayer, in his humanity.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.160]   This is beyond us.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:45.080]   If we do not pray, and God does not supernaturally support us through your prayers, this is not
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.440]   something that man can do by being smart.
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:54.480]   In fact, I would stay away from people who think they can do it, because the next step
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.920]   is disaster.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.080]   God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:07.920]   So when you see a proud man in the front, get in another line, because disaster's coming.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.720]   Paul says in 2 Corinthians 3, 5 through 6, "Not that we are adequate in ourselves to
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:17.280]   consider anything as coming from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God, who also made
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:22.680]   us adequate as servants of a new covenant."
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.680]   Church is impossible.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.440]   I mean, think about how God put the church together.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.080]   He didn't bring the smartest, right?
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.120]   Clearly, he didn't bring the smartest.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.400]   You read the New Testament, right?
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.400]   They're not the smartest.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.400]   In fact, Paul says, whenever they started getting proud and competing with each other
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.560]   in 1 Corinthians, he's like, "Did you forget how dumb you were?
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.960]   Why are you trying to be so smart?
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:50.400]   Did you forget that God chose you because you were of no repute?
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.880]   Nobody knew who you were.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.920]   In fact, God chose you because you were dumb.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.160]   God chose you because you didn't have anything to offer."
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:03.160]   He said, "Why are you trying to up one on another?
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.160]   I'm going to compete with righteousness, compete with knowledge."
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.440]   He said, "Humble yourself."
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.940]   He said, "The whole reason why the church is falling apart is because somehow you see
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.840]   yourself better than you really are.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.080]   He chose you because you have nothing."
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:23.000]   If you look at the early church, he chose people who were going to get out of the way.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.240]   He deliberately chose people who were going to be humble.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.800]   He even allowed them to fail.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:35.880]   Whatever pride that they had, whatever pride that Peter had, he said, "Okay, they're all
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.560]   fair to you, but not me."
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.520]   He just lets him fail, miserably.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:44.200]   In fact, he failed the most miserably than any other disciples because he had the greatest
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.440]   pride.
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:51.880]   He was trying to show them this is impossible, and then the moment you think it's possible,
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.440]   that's when you are in the greatest danger.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.440]   That's when you are the weakest.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:34:00.520]   That's why Paul says, "When I am the weakest, he is the strongest."
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.920]   Look at this church, the church that we run.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.720]   You know why church is difficult?
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:14.240]   Because this room is filled with a bunch of weirdos.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:18.200]   It's true, including myself.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:22.040]   Some of you guys may be thinking, "Yeah, those people.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.040]   I know some people."
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.040]   No, you.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.040]   I'm talking about you.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.480]   I'm talking about me.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:32.560]   The reason why I say that is that no matter how socially well-adjusted you may be, you're
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.520]   weird to somebody.
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.520]   You're weird.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.400]   If you like Disneyland, you're weird.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.400]   You are weird.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.440]   I don't get it.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:48.180]   So it doesn't matter how well-adjusted you are, you're weird to somebody.
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:53.320]   We come from all different backgrounds, different paradigms, and what we value, what is right
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.680]   and wrong.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.400]   Outside of Christ, we all have different opinions.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:00.360]   Look at the way the pandemic is handled.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:05.880]   Some of you are angry that we're not wearing masks.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:09.120]   How dare you?
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.920]   And then some of you are like, "We're not communists."
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:15.080]   How dare you?
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:18.800]   And we're in the same room.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.080]   We're serving the Lord together in the same room.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.680]   We're all weird in some way.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:31.720]   I remember when we were doing the building, I realized how separate the world becomes
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.720]   easily.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.880]   We have a tendency, starting from, I think in junior high school, there's still some
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:37.880]   diversity.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:41.160]   You'll have friends all over the place, but as soon as you enter high school, people start
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.800]   to kind of make clicks.
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.280]   So if you're athletes, you kind of hang out with the athletes.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.040]   If you're trying to get into Stanford, you have your group of friends.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.400]   There's a name for that.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:58.280]   There's a group of people that go that direction.
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:02.880]   If you're good at tissue or if you're into rap music, whatever it is, you slowly start
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.120]   to go your direction.
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:09.720]   And then by the time you get into college, you're completely segregated.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.720]   Engineers are with engineers.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:15.160]   And then if you are blue collar, you end up going to with blue collar people.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:20.360]   And then when you graduate, you go to work, you don't even see other people.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.760]   So if you're a blue collar worker, and that's it, those are the guys you relate to.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.920]   These are the guys, I hate these white collar guys.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.400]   If you're an accountant, that's the world you're in.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:35.800]   When we were building this building, I realized how difficult this job is to be a general
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.280]   contractor.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:43.680]   Because you have the engineers and the contractors who are trying to come to an agreement.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:51.680]   And so what I noticed was the engineers are concerned about the integrity of the building.
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:55.000]   They don't care how it looks.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.060]   Contractors are concerned about the functionality.
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:03.200]   So the engineer built it so that the door is a certain size because you need these beams
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.520]   and this in order to keep the building up.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.480]   But the contractors looked at the drawing and said, well, if you build it like that,
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:12.680]   it may be sturdy, but no one's going to go through this door.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.360]   It's not useful.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:18.800]   So what's the point of having a strong structure when you can't use it?
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:25.200]   And the engineers, what's the use of having a door people use when you're going to die?
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.400]   There's a point that both of them have.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:33.520]   So you have engineers and you have contractors who have their view and they have truth, and
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.780]   both of them have realities that you need to abide by.
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:41.900]   But when you try to bring these two people together, after experiencing this building
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.840]   and the other building, it's a wonder how they don't kill each other.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:51.720]   I mean, literally, I've seen fights break out in both this building and that building.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:55.480]   I'm in the middle watching this and like, how do they ever come together?
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:59.880]   This is the reason why these guys just hang out with their friends and these guys hang
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:00.880]   out with their friends.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:07.160]   We have engineers in this building, right, or sitting with contractors.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:11.400]   And the only time you will rub shoulders with them, because in any other context, you guys
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.680]   are like, oh, man, what are they doing?
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.680]   They're so disorganized.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.280]   You know what I mean?
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.400]   All they care about is the functionality.
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:23.560]   And then you have some of you guys just live on spreadsheets.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.560]   Everything had to make sense.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:32.200]   Tomorrow, 8 a.m., 8 15, 8 17.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:36.640]   Every once in a while we take a trip and I ask some of our engineer types, like, hey,
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.040]   can you give me some suggestions on where to go?
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.440]   They give me 15 pages of their itinerary.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:48.200]   Seriously, they wake up at 6, it's 6 o'clock, wash your face, 6 o'clock, 7, you know what
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.440]   I mean, get the pot, 6 15, do this.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.320]   And it's like, oh, my gosh, why would I even go on vacation?
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.360]   I'm tired looking at this.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.300]   I didn't want to take a test.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:03.880]   The church is filled with diverse people who have different perspective.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:09.920]   And if they're not mature, they will not yield.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.020]   My perspective is right.
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.720]   This building's going to fall if we don't do this.
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:13.720]   My perspective is right.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.940]   It's useless if we build it this way.
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.360]   And they're unwilling to give in.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:26.520]   So so much of what we do in the church is managing different personalities so that we
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:31.320]   can come together and love Christ.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:36.720]   But humanly speaking, you would never rub shoulders with a lot of people in the church.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.680]   Only reason why you're here is because we're attracted to Christ.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:45.600]   So the moment that you lose that attraction to Christ, your personality is going to come
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.800]   out.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.480]   Your selfishness is going to come out.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.520]   It has to be done your way.
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:56.560]   And you think everybody is stupid because they don't do it your way.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.640]   Imagine managing that.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:03.160]   I remember years ago I gave a sermon and I got two phone calls that week.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.880]   One couple called me out.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:09.040]   Obviously I can share this because they're not here.
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.520]   They called me out and they said it was urgent.
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:18.320]   So I came out 10 o'clock and they were lecturing me and saying, "Your sermons are too difficult.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:23.680]   So you need to give more illustrations because I want to invite my non-Christian friends
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.560]   and when they come, it goes over their head.
[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.280]   So you need to change the way you preach."
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:33.440]   And I said, "Well, that's just the way I'm going to preach."
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.480]   Sorry you don't like it because it's your preference.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.600]   I'm not going to say you're wrong, but that's just the way I believe.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:42.280]   That same week I got called out by another guy saying, "Your sermons are too shallow."
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:48.880]   I mean, the text that you exposed, there's so much going on here and you only touch this
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:52.520]   and you need to do this and you need to get deeper.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:58.280]   Remember, as I was talking to this individual, I was thinking, "I want to introduce you to
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:08.000]   that couple so that you can get into this room and see who wins.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:16.240]   And then you come to an agreement where everybody's happy and then we'll have another conversation."
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:22.960]   You'd be surprised how often that happens.
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.560]   Let me tell you another funny story.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.080]   I have so many stories.
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:31.080]   I have to cut it off because we have communion today.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:38.800]   Years ago, it was November and it was Pastor Appreciation Month and our church was a lot
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:45.480]   smaller at that time and so people had an idea, "Let's encourage our pastors."
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.440]   Some of you guys remember.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:51.480]   So without our knowledge, they started planning this thing and I just kind of hearing through
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:55.340]   the grapevine, "Something's going to happen on this particular," and they borrowed the
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:42:01.800]   space at Turtle Rock and they say, "Yeah, we're going to try to encourage our pastors."
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.920]   And then I started hearing, "There's trouble."
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.280]   I was like, "What's going on?"
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:09.840]   He's like, "Dude, it's a mess.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:14.360]   There's a group that wants to encourage you guys this way and then there's this group
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:18.480]   that wanted to encourage you this way and they couldn't agree."
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:22.240]   And then as the week's going by, it's like, "Oh, they're fighting.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.800]   They are heated."
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:29.720]   Yeah, and then one group is thinking, "I never want to do anything with that group
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:30.720]   again.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.880]   Don't put me in that guy's small group."
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:41.000]   And so by the time we got to the encouragement and we're sitting there and they made this
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.480]   video and the whole time I was sitting there thinking like, "Oh my gosh, don't ever
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.480]   do this again.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:52.280]   This is the most burdensome, discouraging pastor's appreciation day I've ever experienced
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.920]   in my life."
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.920]   They came out of that thinking like, "Oh, we want to appreciate it.
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:05.160]   Thank you so much and I hate you."
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:13.880]   That happens at the church sadly more than you would think.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:25.400]   It is humanly impossible to do what God calls us to do by our own strength.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.920]   On top of that, our church is run by volunteers.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:29.920]   This is not a corporation.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:34.640]   They can say, "Oh, if you get an MBA and you organize this and do that and do that."
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:38.600]   Well, the difference between a corporation and this, in a corporation, if you do a bad
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.600]   job, you're fired.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:43.480]   And you just get the money and hire another guy.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:49.800]   So we can make the quality go up and up and up, but the church, whether it's 30 or 3,000,
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.120]   the church is like a family.
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:57.600]   So even if that person may not be doing the best job, it's like raising kids.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.960]   Even though they may not be, we can hire somebody to do the best job, but we don't do it that
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.840]   way because we're trying to raise up people.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:12.080]   And so the church with volunteers is not going to run as well as a corporation because they
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.360]   get paid and if they don't do, there's immediate consequence.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.220]   You get fired and somebody else who's skilled gets done.
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:21.440]   People may be grumbling and hate being there, but the company's making a lot of money.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.360]   So as long as that's happening, then we're successful.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.560]   But that's not how the church runs.
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.880]   Church is filled with people who may not be the best at what they're doing, but because
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:35.520]   they volunteered and we want to raise them up and make disciples and we allow them to
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:36.520]   function.
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:45.860]   So when the church is run with volunteers, when they're not focused, they drop the ball.
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:47.360]   When they're busy, they drop the ball.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:50.280]   When they're discouraged, they drop the ball.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:53.240]   When they have relational problems, they drop the ball.
[00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.820]   When they're tired, they drop the ball.
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:59.240]   When you juggled well in your 20s, but you start dropping the ball in your 30s.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.560]   You did well when you're single and then all of a sudden you're dating, you drop the ball.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.040]   You do well before you have kids and then you have children, then you drop the ball.
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:10.100]   You did well in your 30s, but then 40s come and you drop the ball.
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:13.600]   So a lot of the work is picking up the balls, right?
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.420]   Because it's volunteers.
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:19.480]   And on top of that, it keeps changing on us, right?
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:23.360]   I've never passed in a church that's almost a thousand people.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.720]   I've never done this before.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:28.240]   When you ask us, "What's your vision for the next stage?"
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.480]   I have no idea.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.040]   Because I've never done it before.
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:37.220]   I've never passed a church this size before.
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:41.760]   If we stayed 30 and I did it for 30 years, you tell me I'll write a book on how to pass
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.740]   a church of 30 people.
[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:45.740]   But it changes.
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:50.440]   Like, "Oh, certain things were doing fine when it was 200, but it doesn't work at 500.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.880]   And then 700, it was fine, but it doesn't work at a thousand.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.200]   I don't know what it's going to be like when it gets beyond that."
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.320]   We're just kind of making do.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:03.360]   On top of that, we don't get trained for any of this.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.640]   We don't get trained for any of this.
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.640]   Managing money?
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:10.160]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.200]   We have to figure it out.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:16.680]   Pastors go get trained how to interpret the Bible.
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:21.640]   So as long as I stay right here and I don't get off the pulpit, right?
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:25.080]   Because this is what the seminary prepared me to do, right?
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:30.840]   And even this gets difficult sometimes because I have to adjust to you, right?
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.840]   But it keeps changing.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:36.280]   Not only does it change because of the size, the culture keeps changing.
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:39.240]   What was acceptable 30 years ago is no longer acceptable today.
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:45.440]   What I could preach with confidence five years ago is no longer acceptable today.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:49.040]   I remember in the earlier part of the church when the Seeker Friendly Movement was blowing
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.920]   up, you know, people were coming out because our church is struggling.
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.520]   They said, "Peter, you should be so stubborn.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.520]   You need to follow what they're doing, what they're doing.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:58.400]   You should be more cutting edge and doing this and that."
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:02.400]   And it's already hard enough to kind of manage, but like I'm constantly, "You should do this.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.400]   You should do that."
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.240]   It's like, "I'm not going to do that."
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:06.240]   He's so stubborn.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:09.840]   It's like, "I admit I'm stubborn, right?
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:10.840]   I am stubborn.
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:11.840]   I admit it.
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:14.120]   At least I admit it.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:18.040]   You don't admit it."
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:22.440]   But I remember how discouraging that was because we're struggling as it is and it's like, "Oh,
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.400]   maybe it's because you're just being stubborn."
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:30.000]   But by that time I was already burned out and I'm not going to play games anymore.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.080]   I'd rather dig ditches.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.480]   And I used to say that a lot.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:38.760]   I'd rather dig ditches because at least at the end of the day you have a big hole and
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.920]   you did something.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:47.600]   But to have a church and fill it with people and all of that, for what purpose?
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:51.280]   To keep everybody who's nominal satisfied in the church so they can say, "Oh, this is
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:54.960]   a great church and places to raise children."
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.680]   But my conscience is not clear because the truth is not being told.
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.120]   We're not practicing what he told us to practice.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:06.080]   Then at the end of the day, I committed to being fake.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:13.080]   So it's interesting because people would come and they would ask, "Does your church believe
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.080]   in predestination?"
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.080]   And I would say, "Yes."
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:18.240]   "I can never go to a church that practices or teaches that."
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.240]   And they would walk away.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:24.760]   And then all of a sudden, the Young Resident Reform Movement come in and then people younger
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:29.280]   would come into the church and say, "Do you guys practice church discipline?"
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:32.120]   Younger people were asking me this and say, "Yeah, we try to."
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.120]   "Are you guys Calvinists?"
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.120]   It's like, "Yes."
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.120]   "Okay."
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.120]   And we'll call them your church.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.120]   That's interesting.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:42.680]   Five years ago, no one would come because we believe in predestination and all of a sudden
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:44.880]   it became the "it" thing.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.440]   And then as a result, the church started to grow.
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.480]   There was nothing that we changed.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:49.480]   Right?
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:55.240]   So not only does the church change, the culture changes, and you're constantly changing.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.440]   You're not faithful all the time.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.640]   You're not unfaithful all the time.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.120]   Right?
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:05.160]   This is impossible by our own strength.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:10.600]   The only way that the church can be the church is if God's doing something supernatural in
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.160]   us.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.680]   If all we're doing is gathering people and sing some songs to encourage you, we don't
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:20.000]   need the Holy Spirit.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.520]   We don't need to be truthful.
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.520]   Right?
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:24.080]   Why disturb people?
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:28.680]   If I take certain things out and say it in a certain way where more people will come,
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:31.040]   yeah, on the surface we're successful.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.800]   If we're 2,000, we're more successful.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.160]   Where for 10,000, we're very successful.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.960]   But so what?
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.620]   If it's fake.
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:45.200]   If the truth is not being told.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:50.240]   If people are not being shaken out of their comfort zone so that they can meet the true
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.360]   resurrected Christ, it's all for nothing.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:57.140]   And this is not something that I can do because I'm bold.
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:00.560]   It's not something that the leaders can do because they're more disciplined or knowledgeable
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.380]   or more courageous.
[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:04.560]   It's supernatural.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:10.440]   The only way that the church can be the church that he intended the church to be is if this
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:16.400]   is a gathering of regenerate people whose eyes have been opened to the gospel of Jesus
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:22.960]   Christ and despite our differences, despite our struggles, despite our temptations, despite
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:29.720]   our shortcomings, we become a community that worships God in spirit and in truth.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:31.920]   That's why we need to pray.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:34.080]   We have to pray.
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:37.800]   We cannot build this church by our strength.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.760]   So please pray for us.
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.920]   Pray for the leadership.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.680]   Pray for times when we are discouraged.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:47.800]   And I know this is not unique to us.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:51.520]   I know there's times when you are discouraged and we pray for you.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:56.680]   And I know even now, we know many people in this room who are dealing with some heavy
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:00.120]   stuff in your life and we're praying for you.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:05.400]   And I pray for our younger pastors, you know, discouragement comes and there's this always
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:11.240]   this constant gnawing at everything that they're doing and discouragement because there are
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.560]   people like everybody else.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:17.720]   They have young children at home they're struggling with trying to raise them.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.880]   Pray for us so that we are not discouraged at our own sanctification.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:24.080]   Lift us up for us because we are men.
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:27.920]   We live in a culture where everything that Christ teaches is going against the principles
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.560]   of this world.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:33.240]   So do it for a short period of time.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:38.680]   Yes, but to do this year in and year out, we need your prayers.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:47.040]   So I'm going to again, before we open up the communion table, right?
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:53.760]   And I'm going to read this really for myself, right?
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:52:00.240]   But I hope that as you remember this poem that I wrote, that these are the things that
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:04.440]   we struggle with that maybe it'll help you to pray for us more specifically.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:08.520]   I have come too far to retreat to remain in my defeat.
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:12.600]   I have no other paths to take for there are too many things at stake.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:17.320]   My soul thirst to see the only King to finally know the joy and peace He'll bring.
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:19.560]   The light will fill the darkness everywhere.
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:21.520]   Nothing that I know will compare.
[00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:26.120]   Though I've fallen more than I can remember, my thoughts go back to that night in December
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:31.300]   when my soul was snatched from the fire and the only King filled all my desires.
[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:33.360]   Not by works, but by grace I will meet.
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:35.560]   I've come too far to retreat.
