[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.860]   Let's take a moment to gather up,
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.340]   bow our heads for a word of prayer.
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.760]   For prayer, I'm gonna take a moment
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.640]   to read yet another Psalm,
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.100]   expressing the kind of attitude and the heart
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.100]   that we wanna have as we approach each Bible study.
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.540]   The scripture is in Psalm 19, verse 33, says,
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.240]   "Teach me, O Lord, the way of your statutes,
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.560]   "and I shall observe it to the end.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.460]   "Give me understanding that I may observe your law
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.560]   "and keep it with all my heart.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.800]   "Make me walk in the path of your commandments,
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.900]   "for I delight in it.
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.680]   "Incline my heart to your testimonies
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.860]   "and not to dishonest gain.
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.620]   "Turn away my eyes from looking at vanity
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.020]   "and revive me in your ways.
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.580]   "Establish your word to your servant
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.460]   "as that which produces reverence for you.
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.900]   "Turn away my reproach, which I dread,
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.060]   "for your ordinances are good.
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.440]   "Behold, I long for your precepts.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.940]   "Revive me through your righteousness.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.000]   "May your lovingkindness also come to me, O Lord,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.340]   "your salvation according to your word."
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.500]   Heavenly Father, when we take time to study the Bible,
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.660]   it is our prayer that you help us learn,
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.300]   give to us fortitude of mind,
[00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.940]   but please, God, help it not to be
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.400]   just an intellectual exercise.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.860]   Let it be thoroughly spiritual.
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.320]   Would you, God, refresh our hearts?
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.080]   Would you make it strong so that, God,
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.660]   we would not live according to sight
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.980]   and according to the wisdom of this world,
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.900]   but rather according to yours?
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.500]   So we thank you this evening,
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.020]   and again, we lift our voices to you in praise.
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.920]   It's in Christ's name, amen.

[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.700]   Lord, you have given promises
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.620]   and you have kept every promise.
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:25.480]   Lord, we thank you that you have given us your word,
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:30.020]   a word that revives the soul,
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.940]   a word that makes wise the simple,

[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.900]   I pray, Lord, as we sing, we pray, we discuss your word.
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.520]   May we continually intake your word
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.400]   so that when it goes forth to each and one of us,
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.400]   it would not return to you void.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.780]   May it apply deep and root deep in our hearts
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.940]   and through it, may it result in doxology.

[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:26.300]   Really cool passage in the Gospels, right?

[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:34.300]   and obviously I'm not gonna be able to cover everything.
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:37.300]   And the purpose, as a reminder to you,
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:40.300]   the purpose of the study of this series
[00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:43.300]   is actually to learn both the rules
[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:47.300]   and also the good common practice of Bible study, right?
[00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:50.300]   And I hope that by going over some of these things,
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:54.300]   you guys are continuing to practice, you know,
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:56.300]   good habits in exegesis,
[00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:59.300]   whether it's for your personal devotion
[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:03.300]   or in preparation for the discussions in your small groups, okay?
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:07.300]   So let me go ahead and take a moment.
[00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:11.300]   I apologize, I should have actually done this before.
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:14.300]   Go to number two.
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:17.300]   To say to you guys, if you guys,
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:20.300]   I realized even last week,
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:23.300]   ideally there could have been a time for Q&A,
[00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:27.300]   but if you want to,
[00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:32.300]   let me see, there we go.
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:35.300]   There's my phone number, right?
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:39.300]   Some of you guys know I am horrendous at email.
[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:42.300]   It's a minimum of two day wait for that.
[00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:48.300]   But text-wise, I try to reply by the end of the day, okay?
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:51.300]   So if you have questions, please know that you can text me,
[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:53.300]   and then what I'll do sometimes is,
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:56.300]   I may not be able to cover it within the session,
[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:58.300]   but on the following week, I may have a quick follow-up
[00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:03.300]   or even post some of the answers to your questions, okay?
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:04.300]   All right.
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.300]   Let's take a moment to pray
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.300]   and then jump into the study tonight.
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.300]   Let's pray.
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:12.300]   God, we thank you for your grace,
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:15.300]   and we're asking, Lord, that your Spirit would minister to us,
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:19.300]   helping us, Lord God, to glean.
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:23.300]   Lord, I may definitely fumble in trying to articulate
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:26.300]   the right rules or how to apply,
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:29.300]   but at just the simple process, Lord God,
[01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:33.300]   of saturating our minds with your word, let it be fruitful.
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:38.300]   Help us, Father God, to truly make wise and keen observations
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.300]   by applying ourselves to your text.
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:42.300]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:43.300]   Amen.
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:44.300]   Okay.
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:46.300]   So just as a quick review,
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:49.300]   remember that it's so important for us to understand
[01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:52.300]   the authorial intent of a passage.
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:56.300]   Like, we're going to say that till we're blue in the face, okay?
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:00.300]   There are so many ways by which we jump to conclusions,
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.300]   whether it's by word association,
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.300]   whether it's by stuff we've heard,
[01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:06.300]   whether it's by something we read, et cetera,
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.300]   and we draw lines.
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.300]   But remember that the key idea is,
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:14.300]   I want to arrive at the author's intended meaning,
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:18.300]   his tone, his focus, his everything, okay?
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.300]   And one of the first ways we do that is to make sure
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:24.300]   that we understand the genre and the flow of thought.
[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:25.300]   The interesting thing is,
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:28.300]   we have this huge chunk of the New Testament Scriptures,
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:31.300]   and it actually runs from Matthew
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:35.300]   all the way through to the Book of Acts, okay?
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:39.300]   The Book of Acts reads essentially like the Gospels
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.300]   in that it starts off by saying,
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:45.300]   "This is an official account," so to speak, right?
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.300]   To Theophilus, this is an account.
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:50.300]   And so what's really interesting about the Gospels
[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:54.300]   and the Book of Acts is that, in the most simplest sense,
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:56.300]   it is a bunch of stories.
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:58.300]   It's narrative, okay?
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:00.300]   And it's teachings, collections of teachings
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.300]   from either Jesus Christ, the apostles, et cetera.
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:06.300]   And the thing about it is, you guys have probably felt it.
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:08.300]   You're reading, reading, reading,
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:10.300]   and then you get lost in a teaching moment.
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.300]   Let's say you're stuck in, like, Matthew 5 through 7,
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:16.300]   and you forget the fact that this is actually a story,
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.300]   a narrative, okay?
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:21.300]   But another way to look at the Gospels
[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:27.300]   is to remember that this is complementary testimony, okay?
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.300]   It's not just story time,
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.300]   but it's more of the personal account
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:34.300]   and eyewitness story of the people who saw.
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:36.300]   Okay, why am I talking about this?
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:40.300]   It's because sometimes when people look at the Gospels,
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:44.300]   they come at it with different expectations, right?
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:46.300]   Sometimes, because you're reading Matthew,
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:49.300]   you just wish that Jesus said more in His sermon
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.300]   to give us more about the end times,
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.300]   to give us more about how to do church,
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.300]   to give us more about all this kind of stuff.
[01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:57.300]   But what we're gonna say is,
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:59.300]   it's a tough, tough way to study the Bible
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:02.300]   when you come with expectations on the text.
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.300]   One of the primary ways that I've heard
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:07.300]   both non-Christians and liberal Christians
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:08.300]   attack the Gospels
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:13.300]   is to expect the Gospels to be like courtroom testimony.
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:14.300]   Have you guys heard that?
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.300]   You guys have heard of, like, oh, the Gospels,
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:18.300]   it's like courtroom testimony,
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:21.300]   and it should uphold to the scrutiny
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:23.300]   of the courtroom testimony.
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:27.300]   And it's like, no, we're saying that these are more like,
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:30.300]   yes, eyewitness personal testimonies,
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:32.300]   but it shouldn't be read like that, why?
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:37.300]   Because the Gospels primarily are giving the story of Christ
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:43.300]   as the good news of the Gospel to all, right?
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:46.300]   And when we do that, the news editor,
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:49.300]   he's not writing like he's gonna get grilled
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:51.300]   by the prosecutor, right?
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:54.300]   And so sometimes when, let's say,
[01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:57.300]   a counter argument from an atheist say,
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.300]   hey, how come the Gospels are inconsistent?
[01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:01.300]   How come the Gospels are out of order?
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:04.300]   How come the Gospels don't hold to chronology?
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.300]   You can say, I don't think you understand
[01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.300]   the genre of the text.
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:11.300]   I wouldn't read Psalms like that, would you?
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:13.300]   I wouldn't read the Gospels like that either.
[01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:14.300]   Why?
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:17.300]   Because you thought you could be the prosecutor
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:19.300]   and start demanding that there be
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:22.300]   such chronological accuracy
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:24.300]   when the author actually is more making
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:28.300]   a focused thematic presentation of the good news.
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:29.300]   Does that make sense?
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:32.300]   So I hope that I'm trying to draw a line
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:34.300]   between why it's important for us to know
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:38.300]   the genre of a text is because there are people
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:40.300]   who will read it with false expectations
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.300]   when they don't understand that.
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:45.300]   Okay, so then when thinking about the genre
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:48.300]   of the book of Matthew, which is our text,
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:51.300]   we're gonna do a little bit of introduction, okay?
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:54.300]   So if you take a class on New Testament introduction,
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:56.300]   you'll go through every book and look at
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.300]   what are the overarching themes,
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:01.300]   what are some of the ways the author is speaking, et cetera,
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:04.300]   and remember that each Gospel writer,
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:07.300]   if you just read the text and it's full,
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:10.300]   and I wanna encourage you guys,
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:12.300]   sometimes, let's say you're doing your devotions
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.300]   and you do your devotions where it's kind of like
[01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:16.300]   Bible through the ear, three chapters
[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:18.300]   of the Old Testament, one chapter of the New,
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:20.300]   and you're reading the Gospel like that,
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:23.300]   that's great because you're getting through the Bible.
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:27.300]   But at certain moments, you actually wanna sit
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.300]   and read the whole story.
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.300]   Why?
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:33.300]   Because the author is moving you.
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:37.300]   He wants you to actually come to a certain conclusion
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.300]   about Christ.
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:41.300]   Sometimes he wants you to feel the movement of the story
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:43.300]   and you will see that the story moves
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:45.300]   really different from book to book.
[01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:47.300]   You will see that the book of John,
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:49.300]   it moves really fast into the early portions of his life,
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:52.300]   stops at certain very key moments to define
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.300]   who Jesus is and his divinity,
[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:57.300]   and then it takes a screeching halt
[01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:01.300]   and it goes slow through the last week of his suffering.
[01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:05.300]   Well, for the book of Matthew,
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:08.300]   the author is highlighting Jesus as the Messiah
[01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:09.300]   and the King.
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:11.300]   And so you'll see this regular focus
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.300]   at identifying Christ.
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:17.300]   And in that endeavor, he highlights so many
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:20.300]   fulfilled Old Testament prophecies.
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:22.300]   The author, actually, a lot of people believe
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.300]   that it's primarily written to a Jewish audience,
[01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:27.300]   in a sense, because there are so many references
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:30.300]   to Old Testament names, Old Testament prophecies,
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:31.300]   without explanation.
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:34.300]   It just assumes you know.
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.300]   And so in that way, the book of Matthew
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.300]   is connecting the dots and saying,
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:41.300]   this is the fulfillment of the Messianic promise.
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:44.300]   Even when you go to the beginning genealogy,
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:47.300]   the stuff that we just like blow past really fast,
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:50.300]   you will see that there is a direct line
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:53.300]   to the Davidic Messianic promise.
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:55.300]   And so it emphasizes Jesus' role
[01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:58.300]   as the Messianic King from David's line.
[01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:00.300]   What's more, the book of Matthew,
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:04.300]   in its structure, focuses not the movements
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:06.300]   of like miracles that happen.
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.300]   There are for sure some there.
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:10.300]   But those of you guys who have studied Matthew,
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:12.300]   you know that the book has been structured
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:15.300]   by way of the discourse, the teachings of Christ,
[01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:17.300]   the authoritative teachings of Christ.
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:21.300]   For example, the huge chunk at the early onset,
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:24.300]   in Matthew 5-7, the Beatitudes,
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:27.300]   the words of Christ are recorded that way,
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:29.300]   and that's how it's structured.
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:33.300]   So here, the reason why I'm saying this stuff
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:38.300]   is because when we want to appreciate our text,
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:43.300]   here in Matthew 16, I know we kind of did
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:45.300]   a dangerous thing by just jumping down
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.300]   and then start reading.
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:49.300]   But you already see all this stuff pop up
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:52.300]   where when Jesus starts asking the question
[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:55.300]   about who do people say the Son of Man is,
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:58.300]   the good inductive student will ask like,
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.300]   the Son of Man, why does he keep referring
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:01.300]   to himself like that?
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.300]   That's weird, right?
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:07.300]   I mean, there is nobody else who refers
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:09.300]   to themselves as like the Son of Man.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:13.300]   And you guys know it's a rich, rich title
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:15.300]   that comes from Old Testament prophecy.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:18.300]   But then, actually, you look at every other guess
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:19.300]   and a lot of the major terms,
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:22.300]   and you would kind of have to know, right,
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:24.300]   why did they start thinking that it was
[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:25.300]   John the Baptist?
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:26.300]   Why Elijah?
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:27.300]   Why Jeremiah?
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:29.300]   Why one of the prophets?
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:31.300]   Because we know that there is prophecy
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:32.300]   that when the Messiah comes,
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.300]   there will be a forerunner.
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:37.300]   And that forerunner would be in the spirit
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:38.300]   of Elijah.
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:41.300]   So again, knowing that this book has this kind
[01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:44.300]   of thematic or repeated idea of fulfillment
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.300]   of the Old Testament, it behooves us
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.300]   to kind of be ready to know like,
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:50.300]   oh yeah, there's a lot of terms like this.
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.300]   Okay, so you don't have to jot this down,
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:58.300]   but again, there are themes for each gospel.
[01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:03.300]   And you will see that when you do full read-throughs,
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:05.300]   that they move so differently.
[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:10.300]   And again, as just kind of an encouragement to you,
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:13.300]   when you go through the gospel and you walk
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:16.300]   through Jesus' life and His miracles,
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:18.300]   and you're reading the entirety of the gospel
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:22.300]   in one sitting, sometimes you get to Jesus' crucifixion
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:25.300]   and you're already an emotional wreck
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:27.300]   because you've been walking with Him.
[01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:30.300]   But imagine if you're just reading one chapter a day,
[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.300]   and then, you know what I mean,
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:34.300]   you just chop that up, and then you all of a sudden
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.300]   break into His suffering.
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:38.300]   Sometimes there's just a disconnect.
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.300]   Why?
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.300]   Because we will talk about this later
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:43.300]   when we talk about Old Testament narrative,
[01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:46.300]   but narrative has people, place, scene,
[01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:49.300]   all the things that you know of good stories,
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:52.300]   but it also has incredible movement of plot.
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:54.300]   You have to follow that, and the only way
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:57.300]   you can do that is to read it in whole.
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:02.300]   Okay, please note that obviously the gospel
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:05.300]   sometimes is difficult in interpretation
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:08.300]   because there are different features,
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:10.300]   unlike a lot of the other texts.
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:12.300]   We have both narrative and episodes,
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:15.300]   almost like, you know, sitcom episodes
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.300]   where like this happened and that happened.
[01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:20.300]   For our purposes, we have important dialogue
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:22.300]   embedded into the narrative.
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:24.300]   He's moving, He's going, and as He's going,
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:27.300]   He looks to His disciples, and He has a teaching dialogue.
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:30.300]   Who do people say the Son of Man is, okay?
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:33.300]   And then from that, we have various teachings,
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:34.300]   so what do we do?
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:38.300]   So this is both a hermeneutical principle,
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:42.300]   but also good practice, which is we have to learn
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:45.300]   to draw biblical principles from narrative texts.
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:48.300]   We have to learn to draw biblical principles
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:51.300]   for our faith and our sanctification
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:53.300]   from dialogue that Jesus is having
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:56.300]   with His own disciples, okay?
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:59.300]   If you guys are frantically trying to take this down,
[01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:01.300]   reminder, we're gonna send the PowerPoint to you,
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:03.300]   and a lot of this is intuitive.
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:06.300]   It's kind of repetitive, but keep this in mind
[01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.300]   that whenever we're studying the gospels,
[01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.300]   we're always gonna be thinking,
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:15.300]   how did the original audience take this, okay?
[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:19.300]   For example, when we asked the question of
[01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:21.300]   who do people say the Son of Man is,
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:23.300]   we're gonna be thinking from the perspective
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:26.300]   of the disciples, right?
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:31.300]   And when Apostle Peter says, "You're the Christ,"
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:33.300]   we have to be thinking of from the perspective
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.300]   of the disciples.
[01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:36.300]   Why?
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:39.300]   Because for them, they have been in such a tradition.
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.300]   They've been looking for the Messiah.
[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.300]   They've been looking for the Messiah,
[01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:47.300]   and we recognize in one part how it should be,
[01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:51.300]   is they should be elated if Apostle Peter says,
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:53.300]   "You're the Christ," and Christ essentially
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:55.300]   confirms it as, "I am the Son of Man.
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:56.300]   "You're blessed.
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:57.300]   "You're right."
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:58.300]   Can you imagine?
[01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:01.300]   Like, can you imagine the scene, right?
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:03.300]   We always have to be putting ourselves
[01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:05.300]   into their shoes and thinking,
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:07.300]   how did they take this?
[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:10.300]   And it helps us appreciate the text so much more.
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:13.300]   Obviously, we start thinking,
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:15.300]   how are we different, though?
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:17.300]   And there's gotta be some interesting thought
[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:20.300]   through this, is in some sense,
[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:21.300]   there's a lot of difference,
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:22.300]   incredible amount of difference.
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.300]   In some sense, there isn't.
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:27.300]   I mean, people have all sorts of ideas
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:29.300]   of who Jesus is to them.
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:32.300]   People have used Jesus for whatever purposes
[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:33.300]   in their life.
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:35.300]   None of these opinions are very strong,
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.300]   but everybody has one.
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:40.300]   And the important thing is we are asked,
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.300]   who do we say Jesus is, right?
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:45.300]   Number three, what are the theological principles
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:46.300]   that are primary?
[01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:48.300]   Even if it's a narrative,
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.300]   there is typically an emphatic point from the author.
[01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:51.300]   Where is that?
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.300]   How does this theological principle
[01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:54.300]   fit with the rest of the Bible?
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:56.300]   We're gonna be doing cross-references.
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.300]   And then, how should individual Christians today
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:00.300]   live out the theological principle?
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.300]   And this is where, yes,
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:04.300]   the meaning of the text is one,
[01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:06.300]   but its implications for you,
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:07.300]   you have to meditate.
[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.300]   You have to slow down.
[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:11.300]   So, I just walked through this with you guys,
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:13.300]   and I'm gonna just take a moment to say,
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:15.300]   this is a lot.
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:18.300]   Here's my encouragement to you for your Bible study.
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:20.300]   When you come across a passage
[01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:22.300]   like the one we studied today,
[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:25.300]   it's not only okay, but I recommend
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:28.300]   you do that passage for devotions the whole week,
[01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:30.300]   every single day, right?
[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.300]   You read the big chunk, and you meditate.
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:35.300]   You read the small portion of Jesus' question,
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:36.300]   and you meditate.
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:39.300]   You read a phrase that you know so well.
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:41.300]   "Jesus is Christ, the Son of God."
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:42.300]   You know that.
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:45.300]   You sing it every time you come to church, right?
[01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:47.300]   But then you start meditating, thinking,
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:51.300]   "But in what way do I not live this?
[01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:54.300]   "In what way do I not recognize this?"
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:56.300]   And then you start thinking through the response
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:59.300]   and how this story has such a ride, right?
[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:02.300]   You go from like, "Blessed are you, Peter!
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.300]   "Now get behind me, Satan!"
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:07.300]   It's like the worst rollercoaster ride ever.
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:09.300]   It just goes, "Choo!"
[01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:10.300]   You know?
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:11.300]   And you start meditating.
[01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:12.300]   I was like, "Why?
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:14.300]   "Why does that happen to Peter
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:16.300]   "in the moment of his greatest confession?"
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:20.300]   All right, so let's get into some of the nitty-gritties
[01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:23.300]   of the text that we have for today, okay?
[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:27.300]   In thinking about drawing theological principles,
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:31.300]   please know that this is where sometimes
[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:34.300]   the danger of interpretation comes out,
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:36.300]   but the hermeneutical rule is that
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:40.300]   when the Bible has implied biblical principles,
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:45.300]   they are valid insofar as the rest of Scripture affirms it.
[01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:46.300]   Okay?
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:49.300]   So that's why we're gonna do drawing biblical principles
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:52.300]   from a book like the Gospel of Matthew
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:55.300]   and then confirming it with cross-referencing
[01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:57.300]   and making sure that it fits in the context
[01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:58.300]   of the rest of the Bible.
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:01.300]   Okay, so verse 13.
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:03.300]   "Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi,
[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:05.300]   "He was asking His disciples,
[01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:07.300]   "'Who do people say that the Son of Man is?'
[01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:10.300]   "And they said, 'Well, some say John the Baptist
[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:13.300]   "'and others Elijah, but still others Jeremiah
[01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:15.300]   "'or one of the prophets.'
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:19.300]   "He said to them, 'But who do you say I am?'
[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:22.300]   "Simon Peter answered, 'You are the Christ,
[01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:25.300]   "'the Son of the living God.'"
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:31.300]   Okay, so when we look at this,
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:34.300]   we start making some observations.
[01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:37.300]   So clearly, Jesus, what is this?
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:39.300]   Hold on a second.
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:43.300]   This is Jesus' time with the disciples
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:45.300]   and in His means of teaching them,
[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:48.300]   He actually starts to draw stuff out of them
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:51.300]   by way of this kind of questioning and prying.
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:53.300]   And it is interesting that He begins
[01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:55.300]   with this generic question of,
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:57.300]   "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"
[01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:59.300]   And I think we can learn a lot
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:03.300]   from comparing and contrasting the two questions.
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:06.300]   One, we recognize the contrast A,
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:09.300]   that at first, He wants to know what people are saying
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:12.300]   and how the disciples perceive it, right?
[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:15.300]   And then in the second question, in verse 15,
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:18.300]   He says, "But what about you?"
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:21.300]   Okay, I hope that you guys made that observation, right?
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:26.300]   Second, oh man, second, contrast B.
[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:29.300]   Within the question, it is interesting
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:30.300]   that He uses the question,
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:33.300]   "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:37.300]   using, again, a theologically rich title.
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:41.300]   And then later, He says, "But who do you say I am?"
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:43.300]   What's really interesting about that then is
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:48.300]   that Jesus is already giving us a theological equation.
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:51.300]   The Son of Man is already a prophecy
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:54.300]   of the One who would come, okay?
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:56.300]   Of the Messiah who would come.
[01:16:56.300 --> 01:17:00.300]   Bring deliverance, bring power, bring peace.
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:02.300]   And then when He asks the question,
[01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:04.300]   "Who do you say I am?"
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:06.300]   He's already making that question,
[01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:09.300]   or making that connection.
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:13.300]   And then, within the final comparison I want to make,
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:17.300]   it is the comparing and contrast between the answers.
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:21.300]   They say John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah,
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.300]   one of the prophets.
[01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:25.300]   Again, I hope you guys ask the question, "Why?
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:28.300]   "Why did the disciples guess these guys?"
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:32.300]   You know, "Why did the disciples guess these prophets?"
[01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.300]   But in the midst of Jesus' questioning,
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:36.300]   remember, Jesus was, if you kind of picture the scene,
[01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:39.300]   He was asking all of His disciples,
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:41.300]   and Simon comes out and volunteers.
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:42.300]   He raises his hand.
[01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:45.300]   "I've got something to say."
[01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:49.300]   "You're the Christ, the Son of the living God," right?
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:51.300]   It's pretty, like, in my eyes,
[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:54.300]   I picture it as quite the dramatic scene, okay?
[01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:56.300]   Because there's this kind of drama of, like,
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:59.300]   Jesus revealing Himself, revealing His powers.
[01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:01.300]   And as you know, as you walk through the Gospel,
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:03.300]   it's like, "Could this be? Could it be Him?
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:05.300]   "Who is this? How could He do this?"
[01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:06.300]   You know?
[01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:07.300]   And when He meets, like, the woman at the well,
[01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:08.300]   it's like, "If you knew who I was,"
[01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:09.300]   and all that kind of stuff,
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:12.300]   the drama is the revelation of who Jesus is.
[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:15.300]   And here, Simon's like, "You're the Christ!"
[01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.300]   And then Jesus is like, "Blessed are you, Peter!"
[01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:21.300]   You know? It's a dramatic moment.
[01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:23.300]   Now, my question to you is,
[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:25.300]   how do you draw principles of that?
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:28.300]   Do you just go, "Okay, good story,"
[01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:30.300]   and then you move on?
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:34.300]   Well, I think that you can draw principles
[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:37.300]   from these three, comparison and contrast,
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:42.300]   because Jesus is using it clearly as a teaching moment.
[01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:44.300]   And because Jesus has asked the question,
[01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:47.300]   I could ask you the same questions, right?
[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:49.300]   Let's talk about principles.
[01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:51.300]   Let's talk about principles of faith,
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:55.300]   principles of our practice, principles of doctrine.
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:58.300]   And when Jesus asks, "What do you people say?"
[01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.300]   I want to ask you a question.
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:03.300]   Are you satisfied that other people know
[01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:04.300]   about who Christ is,
[01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:08.300]   but you don't have your own conviction?
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:09.300]   Right?
[01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:11.300]   Can we say that a principle for life
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:13.300]   is that it's not enough?
[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:15.300]   And we've been saying it so long here at Brain,
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:17.300]   it's not enough for you to be around people
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:20.300]   who have convictions you have to have your own?
[01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:23.300]   Of course it's legitimate to say that.
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:24.300]   Much of the scriptures tell you,
[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:27.300]   "Stop having so much confidence in your heritage
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:28.300]   "because of my forefather.
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:29.300]   "Stop having so much confidence
[01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:32.300]   "because you're part of this Jewish sect," right?
[01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:33.300]   "Stop having so much confidence
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:35.300]   "because you're a part of this group,"
[01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:36.300]   or whatever it may be.
[01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:38.300]   And here's a question to you.
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:40.300]   There are times in the Christian life
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:43.300]   where you get so drifting in your faith
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:45.300]   that you don't realize much of your faith
[01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:48.300]   is propped up by your community, right?
[01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:50.300]   There is no private spiritual activity.
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:51.300]   You don't pray on your own.
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:52.300]   You don't read on your own.
[01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:57.300]   The only time you do is right here.
[01:19:57.300 --> 01:20:00.300]   And Jesus is gonna say, "That's not enough."
[01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:03.300]   What about your convictions?
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:05.300]   What about your, "I got something to say.
[01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:08.300]   "I think I know," right?
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:11.300]   And that's so important for us to understand.
[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:15.300]   Next, the Son of Man versus I Am.
[01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:17.300]   This conviction is the conviction of good news.
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:22.300]   The focus on the identity of Christ is huge here.
[01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:27.300]   The emphatic point of this story is the confession, right?
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:29.300]   And that, to the Jewish people,
[01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:31.300]   that's like the boom.
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:32.300]   That's like the mic drop.
[01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:34.300]   That's whatever analogy I can give.
[01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:37.300]   I can't think of any more off the top of my head.
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:39.300]   But that's the great reveal.
[01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:41.300]   That's the grand entrance.
[01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:45.300]   They've been waiting for this Messiah all their lives,
[01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:46.300]   all their grandparents' lives,
[01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:48.300]   and all their forefathers' lives.
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:50.300]   This is it.
[01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:52.300]   This is the great shebang.
[01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:57.300]   So to them, the objective identity of Jesus Christ,
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:59.300]   this is the highest level of good news
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:02.300]   and the highest level of doctrine.
[01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:04.300]   And that's what Jesus is gonna say.
[01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:07.300]   There's nothing that's gonna even come close.
[01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:09.300]   I mean, you have various theological doctrines
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:10.300]   in the church.
[01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:12.300]   Last week, we talked about spiritual gifts,
[01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:14.300]   and we talked about what is the perfect
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:15.300]   or something like that.
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:17.300]   Was that two weeks ago?
[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:18.300]   Whoa, okay.
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:20.300]   Last week, we talked about women in ministry
[01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:21.300]   and gender roles, et cetera,
[01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:24.300]   how God provides instruction on that.
[01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:27.300]   And the previous week, we talked about spiritual gifts.
[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.300]   None of the other doctrines come close
[01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:34.300]   to this highest doctrine, who is Jesus Christ, okay?
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:38.300]   And then, in thinking about this idea
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:44.300]   of the, comparing here real fast,
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:48.300]   the prophets and Christ the Son,
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:53.300]   we recognize that to Jesus, if somebody were to say,
[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:55.300]   can you just imagine for a moment,
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:58.300]   are you one of those guys?
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:02.300]   How offensive it would be to him, right?
[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:05.300]   The emphatic point, actually, also,
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:07.300]   is that, yes, there were many prophets,
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:11.300]   but all of them combined are inferior to Christ.
[01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:13.300]   He is the Christ.
[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:15.300]   And there's this question and point for us to take.
[01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:18.300]   When there is such a emphatic point,
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:21.300]   that it's definitive that he is the anointed one,
[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:23.300]   Christ means anointed, right?
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:27.300]   That he is the Messiah, and he's the exclusive Messiah.
[01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:28.300]   Why?
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:30.300]   Because one of the contrasting ways
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:32.300]   that we can read that is this.
[01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:34.300]   Think about what it would mean
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:40.300]   if we said Jesus is a child of God.
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:45.300]   Jesus is a deliverer.
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:48.300]   The difference between the word a and the
[01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:51.300]   is one is an indefinite article,
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:54.300]   and the other is definite.
[01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:57.300]   Does that matter in Bible study?
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:59.300]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:01.300]   Why do I say that?
[01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:05.300]   Because, real fast,
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:09.300]   for us, we've been learning that in good exegesis,
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.300]   the good practice of hermeneutics
[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:13.300]   is that we're gonna go and take a look
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:15.300]   at the biggest and highest level of genre,
[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:18.300]   just picking the whole style of the book.
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:20.300]   Then we're gonna look at the book's context as a whole
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:22.300]   and its general content.
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:24.300]   Then we're gonna look at the paragraph
[01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:25.300]   and its full of thought.
[01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:28.300]   We're gonna look at the sentence and its structure.
[01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:30.300]   We're gonna even look at one single word
[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:32.300]   because it matters.
[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:36.300]   Jesus is the Christ.
[01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:40.300]   You know, in really pushing this point,
[01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:42.300]   I remember a long time ago listening to a sermon.
[01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:45.300]   This was back in like 2010 by Paul Washer.
[01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:47.300]   Do you guys know who that is?
[01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:50.300]   He's like this very serious preacher.
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:52.300]   He never, no, I never,
[01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:55.300]   he rarely ever cracks a joke in a sermon.
[01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:57.300]   I try to stick in at least one, okay?
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:58.300]   He never cracks a joke.
[01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:01.300]   He was preaching the gospel and he was looking so seriously.
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:03.300]   He looked at a group of,
[01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:06.300]   not like non-Christians, but Christians,
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:09.300]   and he said, "Let me show you a way
[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:12.300]   "to avoid all persecution,
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:14.300]   "to go unscathed in this world,
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:20.300]   "to be safe, to be healthy, to be well."
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:26.300]   He said, "All you have to do is change one word."
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:30.300]   In an act of humility say that Jesus,
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:35.300]   to me, just to me, is a way.
[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:38.300]   Jesus is a savior.
[01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:41.300]   Jesus is a good God.
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:44.300]   But just don't say he's the savior
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:48.300]   that I surrender to and you need to too, right?
[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:51.300]   You just change that one word
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:55.300]   and all of a sudden the whole world is your enemy.
[01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:58.300]   And I remember thinking, "That's right."
[01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:01.300]   The rub, the controversy,
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:03.300]   the in-your-faceness about Christianity
[01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:06.300]   is when we say he is the Christ,
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:09.300]   the Son of God, and there's no other.
[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:11.300]   And in the same way I repented to him
[01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:14.300]   and I put myself underneath him, you have to too
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:17.300]   'cause there's no other way.
[01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:21.300]   The exclusivity of this statement is quite profound.
[01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:24.300]   So I wanted to share with you guys
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:27.300]   that when I build my sermon, this is what I do.
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:29.300]   I observe a passage, I observe a passage,
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:31.300]   I think about its breakdown,
[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:33.300]   I think about contrasts and comparisons
[01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:36.300]   and is Jesus, what is he doing with his questions
[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:38.300]   and clearly his comparing,
[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:41.300]   what is the general opinion of me?
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:43.300]   What do you say?
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:48.300]   And then it's like the revelation of God is this.
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:50.300]   And once I've come to some of those conclusions,
[01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:51.300]   then I build my sermon.
[01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:54.300]   And I would entitle it The Lord's Q&A,
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:56.300]   The Identity of the Son of Man.
[01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:59.300]   And then I would have three headings
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:02.300]   because great sermons come with three points.
[01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:03.300]   And the first would be,
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:07.300]   have you made the objective confession about Christ?
[01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:09.300]   And his identity, 'cause you have to.
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:12.300]   There is no subjective, like, who is Jesus to me?
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.300]   And then you're in a circle
[01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:15.300]   and you want to say something different and profound,
[01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:16.300]   it's like, what about to you?
[01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:17.300]   And then, no, there's none of that,
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:20.300]   there's just one objective identity of the Son of Man.
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:24.300]   But what's more, have you made a personal confession
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:26.300]   of who do you say?
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:27.300]   And then finally,
[01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:32.300]   have you made such a loyal, exclusive confession?
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.300]   Rather than out of fear,
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:36.300]   taking the logical implication,
[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:39.300]   if you believe that he is the only way,
[01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:41.300]   you should have courage to say,
[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:44.300]   then I guess all of you are wrong.
[01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:49.300]   Yes, even if your parents worship ancestors, they're wrong.
[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:51.300]   Your parents worship Buddha, they're wrong.
[01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:53.300]   Your parents go to the Catholic Church
[01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:56.300]   and they pray to Mary, they're wrong.
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:57.300]   And you say that
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:01.300]   because you have made the exclusive confession
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:02.300]   that there is no name under heaven
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:05.300]   given to man by which we must be saved.
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:07.300]   And you know the cost of saying that,
[01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:10.300]   that yes, you will incur the persecution
[01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:12.300]   that Christ said will come.
[01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:13.300]   Is this supported in the rest of Scripture?
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:15.300]   Absolutely.
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:17.300]   1 Peter chapter three,
[01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:18.300]   "Who is there to harm you
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:20.300]   "if you prove zealous for what is good?
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:22.300]   "But even if you should suffer
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:25.300]   "for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed.
[01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:28.300]   "Do not fear their intimidation.
[01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:30.300]   "Do not be troubled,
[01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:34.300]   "but sanctify Christ as Lord in your heart."
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:35.300]   Amen.
[01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:37.300]   What a challenge.
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:38.300]   That was the finger,
[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.300]   like who do you say?
[01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:41.300]   That was the encouragement to us,
[01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:43.300]   to sanctify Christ,
[01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:46.300]   which means set him apart completely as holy.
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:48.300]   There's nobody who comes close.
[01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:51.300]   Christ is not common like everything else.
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:54.300]   He has to be preeminent in our hearts.
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:56.300]   What a challenge.
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:58.300]   In moments like this,
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:00.300]   it is good practice of Bible study
[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:02.300]   to stop and meditate.
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:04.300]   It's good practice for us to sit down
[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:06.300]   and start thinking through like,
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:08.300]   dang, how many times do I say like,
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:11.300]   Christ is the Son of God?
[01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:15.300]   Or even just that idea of Christ, you know?
[01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:17.300]   I mean, just as a quick meditation thought for you,
[01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:19.300]   if one of our youth group students came over to you
[01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:22.300]   and was like, "Dude, we use that term all the time."
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:23.300]   He's like, "Is that his last name?"
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:25.300]   You know, that funny moment,
[01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:26.300]   it's like somebody doesn't know that like,
[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:29.300]   is Jesus his first and Christ is his last?
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:30.300]   And you're like, "No, no, no.
[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:32.300]   "Christ is not his last name."
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:34.300]   But what does that mean?
[01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:36.300]   Christ.
[01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:39.300]   You have to sit there and meditate, right?
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:42.300]   Christ is the one
[01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:46.300]   who is the yes and the amen to the promises of old.
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:47.300]   Christ is the one.
[01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:51.300]   I wanted to show you a beautiful passage.
[01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:54.300]   Sorry, I'm doing stuff a little out of order here.
[01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:56.300]   Daniel 7, verse 13.
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:57.300]   "The Son of Man.
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:59.300]   "I kept looking in the night visions,
[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:01.300]   "and behold what the clouds of heaven,
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:04.300]   "one like the Son of Man, was coming.
[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:06.300]   "And He came up to the ancient of days
[01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:08.300]   "and was presented before Him.
[01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:11.300]   "And to Him was given dominion, glory,
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:14.300]   "and a kingdom that all the peoples and nations,
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:17.300]   "men of every language might serve Him.
[01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:19.300]   "His dominion is an everlasting dominion
[01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:21.300]   "which will not pass away.
[01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:25.300]   "And His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed."
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:27.300]   Wow.
[01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:29.300]   And what does Jesus say in Matthew 24?
[01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:31.300]   "And then the sign of the Son of Man
[01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:32.300]   "will appear in the sky.
[01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:34.300]   "And then all the tribes of the earth will mourn,
[01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:36.300]   "and they will see the Son of Man
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:38.300]   "coming on the clouds of the sky
[01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:40.300]   "with power and great glory.
[01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:43.300]   "And He will send forth His angels with the great trumpet,
[01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:46.300]   "and they will gather together His elect from the four winds,
[01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:50.300]   "from one end of the sky to the other."
[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:53.300]   We should have like a robust picture.
[01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:59.300]   That title is so packed with meaning, you know?
[01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:01.300]   And so we want to appreciate that
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:03.300]   and take time to meditate.
[01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:06.300]   It's good practice within our study.
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:07.300]   Okay.
[01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:11.300]   With that said, I want to wrap up by saying
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:13.300]   obviously we don't have time,
[01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:15.300]   I apologize, to go through the rest of the text,
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:19.300]   but we have other sections that talk about
[01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:22.300]   first was the identity of Jesus.
[01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:24.300]   Then from that, we have Him saying,
[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:26.300]   "I'm gonna build my church,"
[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:29.300]   and then blessing Peter, giving him authority.
[01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:33.300]   And then it moves to Peter getting rocked, okay?
[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:36.300]   It moves to Jesus actually saying,
[01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:38.300]   "Don't tell of this news.
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:39.300]   "I'm going to suffer,"
[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:41.300]   radically disappointing the disciples.
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:44.300]   Peter getting like, "But you're my bro, you know?
[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:46.300]   "This is not gonna happen to you."
[01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:48.300]   And then Peter getting rebuked and saying,
[01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:51.300]   "Your concern is for man's and not God's."
[01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:53.300]   Now, in the midst of that then,
[01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:56.300]   there is an interpretive difficulty.
[01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:58.300]   And the interpretive difficulty that is really, really common,
[01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:00.300]   part of the reason why I selected it,
[01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:04.300]   is that there are a lot of people within that middle portion.
[01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:06.300]   Sorry, I should've moved to this.
[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:09.300]   In the middle portion, in verse 18,
[01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:12.300]   when Jesus says, "I say to you that you are Peter,"
[01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:14.300]   it's kind of weird that He does that, right?
[01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:16.300]   Peter is like, "You are Jesus.
[01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:17.300]   "You're the Christ.
[01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:18.300]   "You're the Son of the living God."
[01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:21.300]   And then Jesus is like, "And you're Peter," you know?
[01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:23.300]   It's so like, wah-wah, you know?
[01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:25.300]   In my eyes, it's so wah-wah.
[01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:28.300]   Anyway, sorry, sometimes I have, you know,
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:31.300]   like I read in between the lines and imagine the scene,
[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:33.300]   and it's just funny.
[01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:35.300]   But within that, it says,
[01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:39.300]   "And upon this rock I'll build my church," okay?
[01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:43.300]   So, if you guys either looked at a study Bible,
[01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:45.300]   or you guys looked at a commentary,
[01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:48.300]   or you guys just looked at your, like, reference columns,
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:50.300]   for those of you guys who have references in there,
[01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:52.300]   they'll probably have a number, and it'll say,
[01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:55.300]   "And Peter's name means rock."
[01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:58.300]   So, what's interesting is, to me,
[01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:01.300]   Jesus definitely is doing something,
[01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:03.300]   and the good student of the Bible is asking, "What?"
[01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:06.300]   I'm not gonna be able to expound on it for you today,
[01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:08.300]   but he calls him Simon Bar-Jonah,
[01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:11.300]   which is his previous name.
[01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:15.300]   That was his original name, Simon, son of Jonah, okay?
[01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:19.300]   But it was Jesus in John, I believe, like 114,
[01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:22.300]   he named Peter, Peter.
[01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:24.300]   He said, "You're Cephas now," right?
[01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:27.300]   Which meant rock in Aramaic.
[01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:30.300]   And Peter, Petros in the Greek, means rock.
[01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:33.300]   And then it says, "Upon this rock, I'll build my church."
[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:36.300]   And so now we have an interpretive difficulty,
[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:39.300]   where a lot of people believe that Peter has the blessing
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:42.300]   of being the foundation, or at least the bedrock,
[01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:44.300]   of the building of the church.
[01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:49.300]   And then the extreme version of that is the Pope, okay?
[01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:52.300]   Catholics believe this is an evidence of the fact that
[01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:56.300]   Peter was the first Pope, Pope, whoa, sorry,
[01:32:56.300 --> 01:33:01.300]   was the first Pope and was given the undue authority
[01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:06.300]   in which he is going to be the person who is delineating
[01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:09.300]   where to draw the lines of truth and falsehood,
[01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:12.300]   and where to draw the lines of salvation, okay?
[01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:16.300]   So the interpretive conclusions are pretty simple
[01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:18.300]   in the sense that clearly Jesus is saying
[01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:20.300]   that he is building his church.
[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:23.300]   And yes, he says, "Upon the rock, Jesus will build,"
[01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:25.300]   but what is this rock?
[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:28.300]   And the other question is, does this text support the idea
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:30.300]   that Jesus will use Peter to build his church
[01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:33.300]   and will give the apostles great authority?
[01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:35.300]   That's all there.
[01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:39.300]   It's not incorrect to be like, "Wait a minute.
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:41.300]   "I remember reading that the church is founded
[01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:43.300]   "on the teachings of the apostles."
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:44.300]   And the answer is correct.
[01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:47.300]   That comes from Ephesians chapter two.
[01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:49.300]   But then what is this rock?
[01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:51.300]   Well, this is where I want to say
[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:53.300]   we have to do good cross-referencing, okay?
[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:56.300]   So going back here, remember the hermeneutical rule
[01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:59.300]   that before we look at commentaries
[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:04.300]   and before we look at other pastors' sermons,
[01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:06.300]   we have to allow Scripture to interpret Scripture.
[01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:09.300]   Scripture is the best interpretation of Scripture,
[01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:12.300]   and because Scripture was meant to complement,
[01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:17.300]   we're gonna find that the Scriptures actually do
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:20.300]   tend to clarify for us these interpretive difficulties.
[01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:23.300]   So going back to here,
[01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:26.300]   in 1 Corinthians chapter three, verse 10 and 11,
[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:28.300]   we know, Apostle Paul says,
[01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:30.300]   "According to the grace of God which is given to me
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:33.300]   "like a wise master builder, I laid a foundation,
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:36.300]   "and another is building on it.
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:39.300]   "But each man must be careful how he builds on it,
[01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:42.300]   "for no man can lay a foundation other than the one
[01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:47.300]   "which is laid, which is Jesus Christ," okay?
[01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:51.300]   So Scripture is like ridiculously clear in this passage,
[01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:54.300]   and Apostle Paul is explaining the very thing
[01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:56.300]   we have a question about.
[01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:58.300]   And he says, "There is no other foundation
[01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:00.300]   "than the Lord Jesus Christ."
[01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:03.300]   What's more, in Ephesians 1, 22, 23,
[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:07.300]   we know that Christ is everything in the church.
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:09.300]   "He put all things in subjection under His feet
[01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:12.300]   "and gave Him as head over all things to the church,
[01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:14.300]   "which is His body, the fullness of Him,
[01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:16.300]   "who fulfills all in all."
[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:19.300]   Christ is the head, right?
[01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:21.300]   Christ is the foundation,
[01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:24.300]   and Christ is everything in between.
[01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:29.300]   He is, okay, He is going to be the sustainer,
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:32.300]   the perfecter, the groom.
[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:34.300]   Every analogy you want to give,
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:38.300]   Christ is the pinnacle foundation of the church.
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:41.300]   So what could this mean?
[01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:43.300]   What could this mean?
[01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:45.300]   Well, just by reading of it, it's very interesting
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:47.300]   how this direction goes.
[01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:50.300]   He says, "You are Peter," which, yes, He is blessed
[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:53.300]   because He's been given the grace of revelation.
[01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:56.300]   And then, in the Greek, He says, "You are Peter,"
[01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:59.300]   which is a masculine name, nominative, noun.
[01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:02.300]   And then He says, "Upon this rock,"
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:05.300]   which is a feminine noun, singular,
[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:07.300]   "I will build My church."
[01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:09.300]   But what is He saying?
[01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:11.300]   There could be two interpretations.
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:13.300]   He could be saying, "You're Peter,
[01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:17.300]   "and upon this revelation, this truth,
[01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:20.300]   "and the identity that you have now confessed,"
[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:24.300]   or He can straight be pointing to Himself, right?
[01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:28.300]   But it would be kind of essentially one and the same thing.
[01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:30.300]   In this passage, I think it's quite clear
[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:32.300]   He is pointing to the idea
[01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:34.300]   that what is going to be the foundation
[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:36.300]   but also the success of the church
[01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:39.300]   is going to purely be the identity of Christ.
[01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:42.300]   Take a moment, then, to reflect on this.
[01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:45.300]   For so long, so many people
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:48.300]   have tried to make the church something else.
[01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:51.300]   Have you?
[01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:54.300]   Where people wanted this to be
[01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:56.300]   the best form of a social club possible.
[01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:58.300]   This is the best community.
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:01.300]   This is where we have great friends.
[01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:04.300]   The foundation will be Christ.
[01:37:04.300 --> 01:37:06.300]   The expression of the church will be Christ.
[01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:09.300]   The success of the church will be Christ.
[01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:11.300]   People have tried to use the church
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:14.300]   for social empowerment.
[01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:17.300]   People have tried to use the church for political movement.
[01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:19.300]   People have tried to use the church.
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:21.300]   You name it, there's been everything.
[01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:24.300]   Just pure experiences, finding a mate.
[01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:26.300]   I don't know, you can just go down the list
[01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:30.300]   of whatever it may be is on the agenda of our heart.
[01:37:30.300 --> 01:37:32.300]   The Scripture is very clear.
[01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:35.300]   Christ is building His church.
[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:37.300]   And praise God, it's none of those other things
[01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:41.300]   which are our agenda, but our hope for unity,
[01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:44.300]   our hope for success, is that Christ Himself
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:48.300]   is the foundation and He never changes, amen?
[01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:53.300]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:56.300]   Heavenly Father, we thank You, God.
[01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:59.300]   In moments like this when You're teaching Your disciples,
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:04.300]   You do it in such a profound and wise way.
[01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:06.300]   And we know from Scripture, Lord, You have said
[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:08.300]   that You love Your disciples.
[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:11.300]   And in this way, You reveal to them
[01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:15.300]   and You show them just how important it is for us
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:18.300]   to wash away and remove all the different
[01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:20.300]   noises and voices of the world
[01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:23.300]   and to focus on this truth.
[01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:26.300]   We have the Savior who is the Son of God.
[01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:29.300]   So we thank You and I pray that that would impact us.
[01:38:29.300 --> 01:38:32.300]   It would cause us to appreciate You more and more
[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:34.300]   and to think about what we have in the Lord.
[01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:36.300]   God, we again want to thank You for this Bible study
[01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:38.300]   and pray for a fruitful discussion.
[01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:40.300]   It's in Christ's name, amen.
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:46.300]   Okay, so next week the study is going to be parables
[01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:49.300]   because we mentioned that the Gospels
[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:52.300]   is, you know, quite, has such dynamics.
[01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:56.300]   And one of the most commonly misinterpreted genres
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:38:59.300]   of the Bible, there are parables, okay?
[01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:03.300]   So please study Luke chapter 12, verse 13 through 21.
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:05.300]   It is the parable of the land of the rich
[01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:07.300]   when the person has great produce.
[01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:09.300]   And then the article that's going to go out
[01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:12.300]   is called The Sufficiency and Clarity of Scripture
[01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:16.300]   and it's just a one-pager, one article, okay?
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:19.300]   And then here are the discussion questions.
[01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:21.300]   You guys can go ahead and read it,
[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:23.300]   take a snapshot of it on your own time.
[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:26.300]   Please go ahead and have your discussion now.
[01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:28.300]   Have a great night, okay.
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:31.300]   (audience applauding)
