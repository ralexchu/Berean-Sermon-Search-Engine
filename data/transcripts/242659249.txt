[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   Let me pray for us and we'll jump in.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.680]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you again for this evening.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.160]   We ask Lord God that as we study the book of Revelation and the end times that you give
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.160]   us clarity.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.240]   And even if we don't fully understand all the details, help us Lord God to have a greater
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.960]   picture of who you are and your plans that we would have greater security in who you
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.960]   are.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.760]   We pray that you will bless this time, bless the time of discussion and our fellowship
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.440]   that we may be reminded again that why we are here and why we're running this race.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.200]   We thank you in Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.440]   All right so today at least the beginning part of it we're going to be talking about
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.600]   the millennial kingdom.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.640]   We started out by talking about this in the very beginning.
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.360]   The millennial kingdom there's so much written about this particular subject.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.960]   Is the millennial kingdom literal?
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.280]   Is it talking about heaven?
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.320]   When is it going to happen?
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.000]   Who's entering into it?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.440]   What is the purpose of it?
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.240]   What's going to happen during it?
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.000]   What happens to the people who get saved?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.280]   So there's so much written about this period but the actual verses that directly deal with
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.400]   the millennium is only six verses.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.440]   All right, Revelation chapter 21 through 6.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:30.400]   So my guess is outside of the cross, okay I haven't actually done the, you know, went
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.520]   and researched myself but my guess is outside of the study of the cross there's probably
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.120]   more written on this particular subject than any other subject about the end times and
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.600]   about the this idea of this millennium.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.120]   In the very beginning of the bible study we talked about the different views so I just
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.600]   want to review before we get started.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.960]   So the review of the millennium.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.400]   The first view, the postmillennialism.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.520]   Postmillennialism basically believes that Jesus will return after the thousand year
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.480]   reign of Christ.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.100]   Just like the word says, postmillennium.
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.420]   So most of them do not believe a literal thousand years but a symbolic period of time.
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.440]   So when we say a thousand year reign of Christ they're not actually counting 1,000 years.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.600]   Another aspect that they believe in is, again this is all review, that the church is going
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.360]   to gradually bring revival.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.920]   So they believe that though the faithful event, through the faithful evangelization of the
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.080]   world will become more and more like heaven until the final stage of Christ's return will
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.760]   lead into eternal place in heaven.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.420]   So postmillennialism basically is that Christ is going to return after the thousand year
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.840]   reign of Christ.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.960]   And that what they're primarily looking for is the world evangelization.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.960]   When the gospel has reached the world, the world is going to be sanctified because of
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.280]   the church.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:05.760]   So they believe that right before Christ comes the worldly kingdom is going to be more Christian.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.000]   The church is going to experience a tremendous revival right before he comes.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.920]   That's postmillennialism.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.200]   When do you think postmillennialism views may have been popular in history?
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:30.960]   Take a guess, considering what they believe.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.180]   You don't have to say anything specific, but what periods of time in the last 2,000 years
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:45.920]   would the church have been more leaning toward this particular view?
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.880]   Probably right before World War I.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.520]   Whenever there was a tremendous amount of peace, maybe the Industrial Revolution, maybe
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.200]   during the Renaissance, maybe during the peak power of the Catholic Church.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.840]   Whenever they felt like the world was being sanctified and there's no war and things are
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.240]   getting better, they say, "Well, see, postmillennials believe that that's what's going to happen
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.280]   before Christ comes."
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.760]   But after World War I and World War II, this view basically just kind of fell by the wayside.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.440]   Because they thought everything was getting better and all of a sudden they experienced
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.160]   World War I and World War II and say, "Well, there goes that theory."
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.680]   The other popular theory is Amillennianism.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.680]   So today, if you were to go percentage-wise, most people fall under either Amillennialist
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.400]   or Premillennialist.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.760]   The second view, Amillennialism.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.920]   They do not believe or affirm a literal 1,000-year reign of Christ.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.040]   They believe that the binding of Satan happened at the cross.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.520]   Remember how here it says in the beginning, we're going to look at how the angel comes
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.760]   and he binds Satan for 1,000 years?
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.800]   They see that as an allegorical statement that Satan was bound when Jesus was crucified
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.580]   on the cross.
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.800]   And that the church is co-reigning with Christ until his second coming, meaning today.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.760]   So from the time of Jesus' crucifixion until the second coming, that's the millennium.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.080]   That's how they allegorize it.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.000]   So therefore, Amillennial, non-millennial.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.800]   The difference between post-millennial and Amillennial is that Amillennials do not believe
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.200]   that the world will experience increasing peace and prosperity.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   So the Amillennials are not looking for the world to get better and better.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.800]   They also believe that the millennial period started with the church.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.120]   So the post-millennial don't connect the church with the millennialism.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.040]   You understand?
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.360]   So the post-millennials believe that at some point, the millennial is going to start.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.080]   And it may not be a literal 1,000 years, but it's going to be a period, a long period of
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.420]   time where the church is going to bring about revival on earth and then Christ is going
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.420]   to come.
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.440]   Amillennials don't believe that there's going to be an increase in revival.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.200]   Amillennials believe that the millennium basically is the church era.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.840]   Is during the time of Christ until the second coming.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.200]   So that's the major difference between Amillennial and post-millennial.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.400]   You're looking at me like, "What did you just say?"
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.920]   That's why it's written down for you.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.720]   So if you didn't understand that, you can go back and read it and reread it until you
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.640]   get it.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.380]   So if you don't get it, don't worry too much about it.
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.320]   At some point, this is going to come up again.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.800]   The view that we have that we started in the beginning was pre-millennialism.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.480]   Amillennials believe, affirm the literal 1,000 year reign of Christ after his return to earth
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.040]   and will reign in his physical kingdom during that time.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.720]   And that's the view that we're going to be expounding today.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.160]   This view believes the opposite of Amillennial view in that the worst period of human history,
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.040]   sorry, not Amillennial, but post-millennial.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.940]   So if you can correct that, it's the opposite of post-millennial view in that the worst
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.880]   period of human history will be right before Jesus' return to establish his millennial
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.880]   kingdom.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.880]   So basically, what we've been studying up to this point, right?
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.080]   So all the seven judgments, the seal judgment, the trumpet judgments, and then the bowl judgments
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.440]   are all going to precede the coming of the millennium.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.560]   So when all those judgments are done, then the millennium begins.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.040]   Satan is bound, right, for 1,000 years.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.500]   And then after 1,000 years, he's released, and then the white throne judgment happens.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.760]   The end happens.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.920]   So chapter 21 and chapter 22 is a description of new heaven and new earth, the final stage.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.920]   Okay?
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.080]   And that's the premillennial view.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.840]   So when do you think premillennial views tend to be popular?
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.080]   Whenever they think we're in tribulation.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.720]   Whenever you see wars or signs of wars or World War II, World War II.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:04.280]   After World War I and World War II, the premillennial view had a huge influx of new theologians
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.560]   jumping on the bandwagon.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.760]   Okay?
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.640]   So that's the view we're looking at.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:17.280]   Again, it's the specific teaching of the millennium is in chapter 21 through 6, but you can imagine
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:23.040]   the ramification of whatever view you have, because how we understand the end times is
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.920]   hugely impacted on how you view this particular theory.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.840]   Is it a literal 1,000 years reign of Christ, or is the church era the 1,000 year reign
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.520]   of Christ, or is the 1,000 year reign of Christ is when the church experiences revival and
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.400]   we're going to see more and more revival coming?
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.640]   I believe that the third view, the premillennial view, is the most consistent if you take the
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.640]   Bible literally.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.280]   If you allegorize everything in the book of Revelation, obviously it could mean anything,
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.000]   but if you were to take it as literal as possible, I think the premillennial view makes the most
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   sense.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Okay?
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.560]   Having said that, that's the theory that we're going to be going with.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.880]   Millennium kingdom in verses 1 through 6 begins.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:09.080]   It begins by an angel that comes down from heaven.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:14.000]   So that automatically tells us that this millennial kingdom that we're talking about is not heavenly,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.720]   it's not a spiritual kingdom, it's a literal kingdom, because what he sees is the angel
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.640]   coming down to earth.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.640]   The angel has keys to the bottomless pit and a great chain.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:34.240]   So the chain is referenced clearly, the Romans were known to chain their prisoners to Roman
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.440]   guards as an added security against any kind of escape.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:45.320]   So remember when Paul, when he writes to the Philippians, he talks about his chains, right?
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.320]   How he was chained to a Roman guard.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:52.560]   So the idea of this angel coming down and has the keys to the bottomless pit and the
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.600]   great chain automatically kind of gives us a picture of prison, right?
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.480]   And then obviously we know what happens.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.880]   He's going to imprison Satan for a thousand years.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.320]   The second part I already mentioned, the fact that the angel came down points to the millennial
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.560]   kingdom being on earth and not in heaven.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:19.600]   So this is not a spiritual kingdom, but this is a physical kingdom.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.840]   So Satan is bound for a thousand years.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:30.560]   Who binds him?
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.120]   In your Bible, okay?
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.120]   Who binds him?
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.700]   Who binds Satan?
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.040]   The angel does.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:44.840]   Who is powerful enough to go against Satan and actually bind him?
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:53.160]   Can you think of somebody?
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.160]   Archangel Michael.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:00.400]   Archangel Michael is the only figure that we see in the Bible that has that kind of
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.960]   power, right?
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.800]   He's the chief of the angels.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.320]   In fact, I think I have two passages.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:11.000]   Reverend 12, 7-8 says, "Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back."
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.680]   Who wins this fight?
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.240]   Michael and the angel, right?
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.520]   "But he was defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven."
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.160]   Jude chapter 9, "But when the archangel Michael, condemning with the devil, was disputing about
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.720]   the body of Moses, he did not presume to pronounce blasphemous judgment, but said, 'The Lord
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.720]   rebuke you.'"
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:41.360]   So again, my archangel Michael is the angel, the powerful angel that is revealed to us
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:47.680]   in Scripture as a being that is actually able to fight against Satan, right?
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:55.160]   In fact, in Jude chapter 9, actually warns against not taking Satan serious enough, right?
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:02.040]   See, even archangel Michael himself, he says, "The Lord rebuke you, not by his own authority,
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.480]   not by his might, but by the Lord's authority," right?
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:10.360]   So it doesn't say this is archangel Michael, but the Bible only gives us archangel Michael
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.360]   as somebody or as a being that has the power to be able to bind Satan.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.560]   So we're assuming this is archangel Michael.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:28.440]   Satan is bound and temporary holding place.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.240]   The bottomless pit, sometimes called the abyss.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:36.160]   So how many of your Bibles actually says abyss instead of the bottomless pit?
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.440]   Anybody?
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.240]   That's the NASB, right?
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.240]   Anybody else have NASB?
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.100]   So NASB should probably say abyss.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.120]   It's the same word translated, right?
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.520]   And it's mentioned seven times in the book of Revelation.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.440]   And this is not in reference to hell.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.960]   The bottomless pit or the abyss is distinct from hell.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.400]   Why do we say it's distinct from hell?
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.800]   That this is not hell.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:11.820]   Right.
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:17.300]   Later part of the passage that you all read very thoroughly before you came says that
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:21.940]   he's going to be released and then he's going to be, and what is hell called?
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.440]   Lake of fire where he's going to be forever and ever.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.060]   So this abyss where he's being bound is not hell.
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:34.140]   It's this particular place that was created for, to be bound, for the demons to be bound
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:38.540]   and tortured for a period.
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.020]   Satan is called various names here.
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:50.360]   He's called the dragon, which describes a beast-like nature of Satan.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.260]   He's called the ancient serpent.
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.780]   And immediately we get the picture of Satan at the Garden of Eden.
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:02.360]   He was a source of temptation that caused the downfall of all mankind.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.360]   He's called the devil.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.420]   The devil literally means a slander or accuser.
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.840]   In Revelation chapter 12, 10, he's an accuser of who?
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.840]   The brothers.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.840]   Right.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:18.860]   So Satan is the prosecutor who stands before God and if you have any sin that has not been
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.760]   atoned for, Satan is the one who's prosecuting.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.360]   Basically saying no, he deserves eternal judgment.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.360]   Right.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.120]   So Satan is the prosecutor.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.220]   And then Satan, the word itself, ultimately referred to as the adversary, the one who
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.780]   opposes.
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:43.780]   And so he's described in 1 Peter 5, 8, "Adversary, the devil prowls around like a roaring lion,
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.500]   seeking someone to devour."
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.880]   So he's not a passive adversary.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.420]   He's not an enemy who's sitting dormant.
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:55.860]   The Bible describes him as an active adversary, like a lion actively seeking someone to devour.
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.100]   So his activity is constant and it is vicious.
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.100]   Right.
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.140]   So I think somebody brought this up before.
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:09.740]   Is it wise for us to be thinking too much of demonic things when we know that God is
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:10.740]   sovereign?
[00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.740]   Right.
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.900]   I don't know, maybe some of you guys have thought that.
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.940]   Maybe like this over spiritualizing things and saying that maybe that's demonic or not
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:19.940]   demonic.
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.180]   Yeah, it could be.
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.700]   And I was guilty of that when I first became a Christian because I became a Christian in
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.620]   a charismatic context.
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.680]   And I remember everything was demonic, right?
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.420]   Secular music was demonic, right?
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.820]   Secular movie was demonic.
[00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.380]   Certain fashion was demonic, right?
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.740]   Certain areas were demonic.
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.080]   So to me, everything was either from God or from Satan.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:48.220]   So it kept me, you know, kept me obedient.
[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:52.300]   So you can get carried away where it starts to affect you psychologically.
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:56.680]   But it is also a danger to not to think about Satan at all when the Bible describes him
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:02.740]   as a roaring lion seeking someone to devour and to be completely unaware of the schemes
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:09.180]   that he is working in our lives, our thoughts, our hearts, our temptation, right?
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:17.700]   Divisions, hatred, that Satan is constantly working to defile his church.
[00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:22.020]   And it is just as dangerous or even more dangerous to not to be thinking and not to be aware
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.260]   of his scheming.
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:29.060]   When the Bible says he is a roaring lion, he is an enemy who is constantly seeking to
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.820]   devour, not to hurt, not just to deceive, but to devour.
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:38.460]   That's how the Bible describes him, right?
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:43.100]   He said during that thousand years while he is bound, the millennial reign of Christ will
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.900]   be marked by unhindered rule without demonic deception of the nation.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:52.860]   So Satanic work is going to be bound for a thousand years, right?
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:17:00.340]   Does that mean for a thousand years there is not going to be any sin?
[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:15.900]   Will there be sin during the thousand year reign of Christ if Satan is bound?
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.460]   Yes or no?
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.940]   Will there be sin?
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.540]   Satan is not there.
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.900]   Okay, okay.
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.820]   I just wanted you to think a little bit, right?
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.540]   Yes, there is going to be sin during a thousand years because it says at the end of the thousand
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.860]   years there is going to be a white throne judgment, right?
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:42.460]   So there is going to be unbelievers who are going to be born during the thousand years.
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:47.940]   There is going to be sinners who are going to be sinning during the thousand years because
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:53.660]   even though Satan is bound, there is still sin nature in us, right?
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:59.500]   But it's going to be unlike any other period that humans ever experienced because Satanic
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.580]   activity is going to stop.
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.860]   So whatever sinfulness that they are going to experience during the thousand year reign
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.980]   of Christ is going to be internal.
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.420]   It won't be external.
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.980]   There won't be external temptation leading you away from God, right?
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.620]   And we can't blame Satan for anything during that period.
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:18.440]   So that's the thousand year reign of Christ where Christ rules.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:23.860]   Right now, Christ rules through His church imperfectly because of our imperfection.
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:28.740]   But during the thousand year reign of Christ, He is going to physically rule and we won't
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:33.500]   have to ask what is His will because He is going to tell us, right?
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.820]   We won't have to search Him out to say, "Oh, I wonder what His glory is like?"
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.100]   Because we are going to be able to see Him, right?
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:43.660]   So that's going to be what the thousand year reign of Christ is going to be characterized
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.540]   by.
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:53.220]   John sees a throne and on these thrones, he sees many people who are going to be sitting
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.000]   on the throne to judge.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.700]   It doesn't identify who they are, but the Bible does tell us that the apostles are going
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:05.340]   to rule, the saints are going to reign with Him, the resurrected who are martyred are
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.460]   going to be reigning with Him, the Old Testament saints are going to be reigning with Him.
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.080]   So we have a list of people that the Bible talks about that will reign with Him.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:17.460]   So we don't know exactly if that's who He's talking about, but the first thing He sees
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:28.540]   is when He sees the millennial kingdom, we see clear political structure in the millennium.
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.300]   So it's not like you get into the millennium and there's no structure.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.780]   It's just kind of like, "Well, Jesus is ruling so everybody does whatever you want."
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.120]   He says, "There's going to be a political system."
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.540]   Now what kind of political system is it going to be?
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.540]   Democracy?
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.540]   Communism?
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.980]   Fascism?
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.780]   What do you call it when the king rules?
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:49.780]   Monarchy.
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:50.780]   Huh?
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:51.780]   Monarchy.
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.780]   It's going to be monarchy.
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:53.780]   Isn't there another word?
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:54.780]   Huh?
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:55.780]   Theocracy.
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:20:04.140]   Okay, that's not the word I was thinking about, but that sounds more right.
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:12.300]   Okay, all right, I'm not going to say what I was thinking because I think I'm wrong.
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:18.100]   All right, but there is a political system.
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.260]   The souls that were beheaded are going to be resurrected and that's what He sees, and
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.540]   they're going to be resurrected to reign with Christ.
[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:31.940]   And these are the souls that were martyred, specifically they were beheaded for four things
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.460]   that John describes.
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.980]   One, their testimony of Jesus.
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:44.540]   They were testifying about Christ, and again, the hatred toward Christ and the things of
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.860]   Christ are going to increase.
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.700]   But it's not specifically just testimony about Jesus.
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:56.500]   Remember, again, this is just my theory, is that I think liberal theology is going to
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.420]   reign.
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.980]   I think every religion is going to be forced to come to the middle where universalism is
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:03.980]   going to reign.
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.420]   So, it's not going to be just any testimony about Jesus.
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:12.780]   It's the true testimony, the true gospel for preaching the Word of God.
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.020]   That's the second thing it describes.
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.620]   So, it's not just because they're Christians.
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:20.620]   Secondly, they're actively evangelizing.
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:26.060]   And as you guys know, there are parts of the world, like even in North Korea, if you keep
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:30.860]   it to yourself and you never open your mouth to share the gospel, you may be able to live
[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.000]   your life in safety.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.300]   Like in India, the reason why they hate Christians is because Christians actively evangelize.
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:41.760]   So, the pastors that we are supporting, they're constantly living in danger because they're
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.180]   taking the gospel to villages that don't have churches.
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:48.220]   But if they kept it to themselves, no one would know.
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.500]   It's just, okay, you're a Christian, you just kind of live your own life.
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:56.020]   So, he says that the persecution and the martyrdom is coming because of the testimony of Jesus,
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.660]   and secondly, because of the active evangelization.
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:07.420]   Third, for not worshiping the beast or its image, not compromising.
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:13.500]   And then fourthly, for not receiving the mark of the beast on their foreheads.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:19.500]   Remember, when we were studying this, what is the mark of the beast associated with?
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:26.980]   Yeah, the number of men, right, 666, but what is the consequence of not getting the mark
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:27.980]   of the beast?
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:28.980]   Do you remember?
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:29.980]   I couldn't hear anything.
[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:30.980]   Huh?
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:31.980]   You can't buy or sell goods.
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:32.980]   They're financial, economic, right?
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:46.460]   It says that there's going to be economic pressure to get the mark of the beast.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.300]   So, the people who don't get the mark of the beast are going to have a hard time buying
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.300]   and selling goods.
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.100]   In other words, you're not going to be able to take care of your family, right?
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:59.700]   So, these are the things that got these people martyred, and as a result of that, they're
[00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.820]   resurrected and they're going to be co-reigning with Christ, right?
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:08.220]   And they said that they are preserved from the second death because the first death that
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:14.660]   they experienced was a death of martyrdom, that at the end of the millennium, they will
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:23.300]   be preserved from the second death because of their faithful witness to Christ, right?
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:31.740]   So, living at all costs is not the greatest goal of a Christian, right?
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:41.260]   The greatest goal of a Christian is not to experience the second death.
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:46.100]   In verses 7 through 10, the millennial kingdom ends.
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.020]   Satan is released for a short time at the end of the millennium, right?
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:56.900]   Why is he released?
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.500]   The final judgment is going to come.
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.780]   Before the final judgment comes, he's going to allow Satan to, again, just like he did
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:11.820]   before the millennium, Satan's activity is to basically purify the church, right?
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:18.300]   Satan's activity is those who choose to harden their hearts, Satan deceives them even further,
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.380]   right?
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:25.780]   Those who refuse to worship God, Satan lets them go even further out.
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:30.580]   He'll take whatever sin that we have and he'll allow it to take it full course, and that's
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:37.060]   the activity of Satan, that he's going to deceive those who are already being deceived.
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:42.300]   Those who are already being tempted, Satan's activity is to take them to its full course.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:47.700]   And so, at the end of the millennium, Satan is being released for this exact same purpose.
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:53.580]   Before the final judgment comes, Satan is going to allow it to be active again so that
[00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:57.380]   anyone who, during the millennium, who are rebelling against God, he will allow it to
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:03.460]   take its full course so that when God's judgment comes, right, there is no one who's going
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.500]   to be judged who's not going to be guilty.
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.380]   He's going to allow Satan to do its work.
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:13.740]   But it's going to be a short period of time.
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:19.400]   Satan will be given permission to deceive the nations again for a period.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:26.740]   So God allows this deception, this deceptive work to take place.
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:32.540]   So again, you know, when we think about this spiritual struggle that we see in Revelations
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.340]   and all throughout the Bible, the way that the book of Revelation reveals it to us is
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:42.460]   not here's the good and here's the bad and they're fighting and somehow the good overpowers
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:46.580]   the bad and then they eventually are going to conquer and have victory.
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:50.340]   The way that the book of Revelation reveals it to us is God is completely sovereign.
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:54.180]   There is a battle taking place, but the only reason why there's even a battle happening
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:58.260]   is because God is allowing it, right?
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:02.940]   Couldn't God have bound Satan before the thousand-year reign of Christ?
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.620]   Couldn't he be bound today?
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.500]   He's not binding it, binding Satan.
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.500]   He could.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.300]   He has every authority to do that.
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:14.820]   He is allowing it to fulfill his purpose, right?
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:19.260]   So the picture that we see in the final conflict in the book of Revelation is a God who is
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:28.020]   completely sovereign, who is basically allowing Satan to do the work that he is doing, right?
[00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:33.520]   To divide between the goat and the sheep, the wheat and the tares, right?
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.740]   Those who desire to worship the creation rather than the Creator, God will allow Satan to
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:41.300]   deceive them and continue to take them down that path, right?
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:47.780]   So he says he's going to be released for a period of time and then Gog and Magog, you
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.460]   may have seen that before.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:54.100]   They are mentioned in Ezekiel 38 and 39, but most theologians don't believe that this is
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.580]   a direct connection to that, right?
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:02.020]   The title Gog is often used in Scripture to describe general title of enemies of God's
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.300]   people.
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:11.300]   So again, their names are mentioned before, but whenever Gog and Magog is mentioned, it's
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:15.900]   describing enemies of God, those who are in conflict against his people.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:22.940]   So specifically in Numbers 24, 8, Gog is used to describe the human leader of satanic force.
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.340]   So this is closer to what we see here.
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:30.820]   And then Magog is often understood as historical people who fight against God's people, and
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.420]   they are mentioned in Genesis chapter 10, verse 2.
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:40.740]   So just kind of as a reference to what he's saying here is Gog and Magog, who represents
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.860]   enemies of God, who is in rebellion, at the end, what do they do?
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:48.780]   They gather forces, and is this a big, small group or big group?
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.100]   It says many in number, right?
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:57.100]   God is going to allow a final rebellion and Satan to deceive and regather their people.
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:01.360]   Maybe he said, you know, the Armageddon, they tried and they failed.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.980]   So God is going to allow them and maybe they're going to, he's going to allow them to deceive
[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:10.420]   and he's going to deceive a lot of people because this army that is described that Gog
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:14.060]   and Magog puts together is not a small number.
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:19.220]   A large number of people are also at the very end going to be deceived and rebel against
[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.900]   God again, right?
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:32.220]   But it's not much of a battle because as soon as they describe that, right, it just says,
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:37.420]   so in verse 9, "And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:42.540]   camp of the saints and beloved city," okay, and that's it.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.100]   That's the battle.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:47.620]   And then the very next, it says, "But fire came down from heaven and consumed them."
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:48.780]   The end.
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.220]   That's the whole battle, right?
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:57.100]   So Gog and Magog get together, they get deceived and gather this huge army, they surround the
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:01.480]   city of God, fire comes down, the end, right?
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.700]   So God basically allowing the deception to happen, but it's not this long, drawn-out
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:06.700]   drama.
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:12.860]   He just allows it so that the sinners and the rebellious will stand with who they are,
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:13.860]   right?
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.260]   Just like it says in Psalm chapter 1, right?
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.820]   He walks in this council of the wicked, stand in the way of sinners, will sit in the seat
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.420]   of mockers.
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:26.540]   And so he's allowing sin to take its course and those two, they're going to choose, I
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.300]   stand with these people.
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:35.740]   And then as soon as they stand with them, fire comes down and they're consumed, they're
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.740]   consumed.
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:44.020]   The devil will be thrown into the fire to be tormented forever and ever.
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.900]   It is eternal.
[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:51.220]   So this is why the abyss and the bottomless pit is not talking about hell because he describes
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.220]   it here.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.860]   And it is final, it is complete.
[00:29:53.860 --> 00:30:00.220]   It is not a temporary binding, but eternal torment.
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:06.140]   Matthew 28 or 28 to 29, do you remember when the demons saw Jesus?
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:10.660]   And when he came to the other side to the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:15.340]   men met him, coming out of the tomb so fierce that no one could pass that way.
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:18.260]   And behold, they cried out, "What have you to do with us, O son of God?
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.020]   Have you come here to torment us before the time?"
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:25.540]   So the demons already know that this is coming.
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.760]   So this should not take them as a surprise.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.320]   They know this is coming.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.720]   They know that their time is limited.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:36.160]   So during the time that they have, they're going to do whatever they can to rebel against
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:41.940]   God and get as many people to rebel against him as possible because they already know.
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:45.060]   This didn't look like this when I was doing the PowerPoint.
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:51.220]   Mark 1, 23 to 26, "And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit,
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.820]   and he cried out, 'What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth?
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.500]   Have you come to destroy us?
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.460]   I know who you are, the Holy One of God.'
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.660]   But Jesus rebuked him, saying, 'Be silent and come out of him.'
[00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:05.380]   And the unclean spirit convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice came out of him."
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:11.100]   You notice how immediately when the demons are confronted with Christ, they see torture?
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:14.300]   They know who he is, and they know who they are.
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:20.220]   So as soon as these rebellious creatures stand before a holy God, they know judgment is coming.
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.620]   So what is described here should not take them by surprise.
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:27.560]   This is exactly, they know exactly where they're headed, and they're trying to take as many
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.180]   people with them as possible.
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:35.620]   And that's their work.
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:42.580]   So the great white throne judgment, which is the final judgment that all of this was
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:46.340]   coming to, mentioned in verse 11 through 15.
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:51.020]   Throne is mentioned over 50 times in the book of Revelation, but this one in particular
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:57.460]   is distinguished as great.
[00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:05.100]   This points to the autocratic nature of Christ's kingdom.
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:15.660]   It is white as it represents holiness and purity.
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:20.660]   Basically this is the throne of judgment of Jesus.
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:30.860]   And the scripture says, as soon as Jesus comes, the earth and sky, they fled away.
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:36.900]   All that we knew, heaven and earth, they fly away, they disappear.
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.460]   Right?
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:45.900]   Did I miss something?
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.900]   Okay.
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:33:03.780]   Can I move now?
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:08.580]   This is again prophesied in Matthew 24, 35, heaven and earth will pass away, but my words
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:09.580]   will not pass away.
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:13.660]   So Jesus kept saying over and over, when the end comes, the heaven and earth, they will
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:14.660]   pass.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.140]   And that's exactly what he's saying.
[00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:22.180]   When the millennium ends, right, at the white throne judgment, after the white throne judgment,
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.180]   heaven and earth, as we know it, are going to pass.
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.180]   They're going to disappear.
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:32.220]   In 1 John 2, 17, and the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.200]   the will of God abides forever.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:38.220]   So everything that you and I know, heaven and earth, is going to pass.
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:41.580]   And then when it passes, what happens?
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:50.420]   If you read ahead in chapter 21, new heaven and new earth is going to replace what we
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:51.980]   know today.
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.400]   Right?
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.500]   And that's the description of heaven that we're going to be looking at in chapter 21
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:57.500]   and 22.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:06.380]   So remember the fall, right, the fall, and then judgment comes, and what do we call,
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:13.740]   we have creation, right, and then the fall, and then what do we call salvation?
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:16.100]   Recreation, right?
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:19.060]   So God is creating all things new.
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:24.380]   And so at the very end, when the judgment comes, God's going to judge the white throne
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:28.980]   judgment, and then all of heaven and earth, as we know it, disappear, they fade away,
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:33.060]   and a new heaven and new earth is going to come, and he's going to recreate what was
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:34.500]   lost at the fall.
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:41.020]   And heaven in the second 2.0, heaven 2.0, or new creation 2.0 is going to be much better.
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:57.740]   And again, that's the description that we're going to see in chapter 21 and 22.
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:04.300]   So that are judged according to what they had done, and this is in reference to those
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:08.380]   who are going to be judged at the white throne judgment.
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:13.340]   Are Christians judged?
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.340]   Not here, right?
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.500]   The white throne judgment is for the non-Christians.
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:22.700]   So when they say that they are being judged according to what they had done, is hell going
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:26.060]   to be the same for everybody?
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:28.420]   No.
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:32.620]   There are different degrees of rewards for Christians, but there are also different degrees
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:35.820]   of punishment for non-Christians.
[00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:38.580]   It says they're going to be judged according to what they had done, so they're not going
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.780]   to be judged equally.
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:47.460]   Greater the sin, the greater the judgment is going to be.
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:53.700]   In John 5.29, it describes this judgment as the resurrection of judgment.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:36:00.220]   They're being resurrected for the purpose of judgment.
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:04.500]   And death and Hades are also thrown into the lake of fire forever, meaning that there will
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.300]   no longer be death.
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.300]   There will no longer be judgment.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:12.420]   All of that is going to be thrown into the lake of fire forever.
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:18.500]   And that judgment is called the second death.
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:23.220]   So the white throne judgment is the final judgment of all mankind who refuse to believe
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:27.620]   in our Lord, Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.540]   So it's the end.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:35.700]   The end of human history, as we know it, heaven and earth as we know it, ends with chapter
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.700]   20.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:42.380]   And then chapter 21 and 22 is going to be a description of the new heaven and new earth,
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.260]   which we'll look at in the next couple weeks.
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:49.780]   I want to share a couple verses before I break you guys up into your small groups.
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:53.820]   One, 2 Thessalonians 2, 5 through 12.
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:57.020]   I'll just read it together with you.
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:04.980]   For Paul, how long was he in Thessalonica?
[00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:06.820]   He says three Sundays.
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.740]   So if he stayed there long, maybe a few more Sundays than that.
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.100]   So we're looking at maybe a month or two months.
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.340]   He wasn't there long.
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.340]   Remember how he came out?
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:19.380]   He was being chased out by the Judaizers or the Jews, right?
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.380]   And he runs to...
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:27.200]   Anybody know where he runs to from Thessalonica?
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.260]   The Berean Community Church, that's where he runs to.
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:33.900]   So he runs to Berea, right?
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.220]   That's how he ends up in Berea.
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:36.540]   That's where we get our name, right?
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.860]   Act 17, 11.
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:41.180]   But he was only there for a short period of time.
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:46.820]   But during that short period of time, imagine if I had three or four weeks and I was going
[00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:51.260]   to teach the essentials, like how many of you who would go to China for two to three
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:55.980]   weeks and you have two to three weeks to teach them about the gospel, who Jesus is, are going
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:59.220]   to talk about the end times?
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:02.520]   The man of lawlessness, how he's being withheld, right?
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.700]   We don't normally think of that as an essential thing that we need to teach, but obviously
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.700]   Paul did.
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:12.100]   Because Paul says, "Do you not remember that when I was still with you, I told you that
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:17.380]   these things, and you know that what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:18.500]   time.
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.900]   For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work.
[00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:25.260]   Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way."
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.260]   So let me stop right there.
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:32.340]   So during that short period of time, that this was the core thing that Paul taught this
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.540]   young church.
[00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.380]   So how important is it for us, right?
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:40.700]   He thought that this was essential enough that along with the core doctrines that this
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:46.060]   is what he taught about lawlessness, for them to be aware that the adversary devil, the
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:49.980]   devil is out actively seeking to get you.
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:53.180]   Of course that would be important, right?
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.180]   Because that's, again, that's what he taught.
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:59.100]   He said, "Remember when I was there that this is what I taught you.
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.860]   And then the lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:06.780]   of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming.
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:10.680]   The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:15.020]   wonders and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing because they refuse
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.820]   to love the truth and so be saved.
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:21.580]   Therefore God send them a strong delusion so that they may believe what is false in
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:28.500]   order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:33.540]   So all of this, everything that we're talking about here was prophesied by Christ, you know,
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:38.060]   the satanic activity and what was going to happen and how Christ is going to come and
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.700]   he's going to end all of this.
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:43.640]   And that during a short period of time he thought that this was important enough that
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.640]   he was going to make sure.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:49.400]   And he says, "Remember I told you repeatedly that this was going to happen," right?
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:54.460]   To warn them that there's a spiritual battle going on, right?
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:59.560]   So when these things happen, when you see satanic activity happen, remember I told you.
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:03.760]   I told you that this was going to happen, that you must be aware, right?
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:08.840]   So again, I think as we're studying through the book of Revelation, again, one of the
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:12.960]   main reasons why I wanted to study this book is for the same reason.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:18.980]   Is that the danger of living where you and I live is that we don't recognize a spiritual
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.440]   battle that we are in.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:28.220]   We tend to think that this is happening in North Korea or in the Middle East or in India.
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:30.300]   But here my bills are paid.
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.840]   No one is knocking on the door to drag me to prison.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.940]   I don't have to worry about the safety of my children.
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:40.120]   And so we naturally think, our knee-jerk reaction is, we are safe.
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.120]   But we are not.
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:46.520]   We are being attacked differently than the Middle Easterners.
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.720]   We are being attacked differently.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:54.480]   And actually even more dangerous when you are being attacked and you do not know.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:58.360]   Where your spiritual life is being destroyed and you're walking away from your faith and
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.080]   you don't even know that that's happening.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.640]   Churches are being divided, being destroyed.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:07.200]   Your hearts and your mind is being messed with and you don't even know that that's a
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.840]   satanic attack.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:17.080]   And so I'm hoping and I'm praying that us meditating and thinking about things at least
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:21.800]   actively think about the spiritual battle that's going on because we are not fighting
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.640]   against flesh and blood.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.800]   This is not just because we're studying Revelation.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.240]   We are told, reminded over and over again all throughout scripture.
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:35.160]   And final verse, ah, I copied the wrong verse.
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:41.120]   Turn with me 2 Corinthians 5.18.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:51.320]   2 Corinthians 5.18 says, "All this is from God who through Christ reconciled us to himself
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.920]   and gave us the ministry of reconciliation.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:58.900]   That is in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:03.760]   against them and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:07.920]   Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:11.640]   We implore you on behalf of Christ to be reconciled to God."
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:16.920]   You see a sense of urgency with Paul as he is telling the Corinthians church that we
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:20.480]   have the message of reconciliation.
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:25.720]   What you and I have been reading and especially at the end part of Revelation chapter 20,
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.440]   that's the final end.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.680]   When we get to that point, there is no second chance.
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:33.680]   There is no other judgments coming because that's the final judgment.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:37.960]   So the warning in the book of Revelation is before that day comes, as long as it's called
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:43.880]   today, right, as long as God is being gracious, the whole reason why it says in Peter why
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:50.920]   Christ didn't come is to give us an opportunity to take the message of reconciliation so that
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:54.440]   they would not fall into the pit of hell.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.500]   So when the judgment comes that they would not be judged.
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:02.120]   So that we would live our lives and dedicate everything that we have, our time, energy,
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:09.440]   money, our resources, our youth, to warn and to inform as many people as possible before
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.400]   we die.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:18.120]   So that when that day of judgment comes, that we can at least say I've done my part in telling
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:20.120]   them the truth.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:25.280]   I think the biggest regret that any Christian is going to have when Christ comes and all
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:30.280]   the people that you could have told that you didn't, not the places that you didn't get
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:35.920]   to go, not the food that you didn't taste, but the greatest, by far your greatest regret
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:40.720]   is going to be every single person that you didn't make the gospel clear to.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:44.640]   You and I don't have the power to save people.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.680]   And that's not what God calls us to do.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:51.600]   God calls us to make the message of reconciliation clear, clear.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:58.840]   So if the people in your life reject Christ because they know the gospel and they don't
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:03.840]   want it, and they don't want you sharing with them, right?
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:07.120]   There's nothing you can do about that because that's a power of God.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:12.800]   But if there's anybody in your life that you talk to even in a semi-regular basis, if you
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:16.920]   ask them, "Do you know what the gospel is?" they don't know.
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:19.440]   That's on us.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:23.480]   For us to be in this room week after week, Sunday after Sunday, to be in this room, to
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:28.480]   hear the gospel, and then to be regularly in contact with people who don't know this
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:33.960]   truth, how can our faith be real?
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.080]   It can't be real.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:40.120]   We can't say that we believe that if we are in this room constantly gathered together
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:44.880]   talking about sharing our prayer request and encouraging one another and doing all these
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.120]   things and then there's people in our lives that we have regular contact with and you
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:54.320]   ask them, "Do you know that there is condemnation if you die without Christ?"
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.000]   And they say, "I didn't know that."
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.400]   That's on us, right?
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.400]   That's on us.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:06.280]   So as we continue to study, we have a few more weeks to study through the book of Revelation,
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:10.680]   that we would think carefully and meditate seriously about what it is that you and I
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:14.760]   believe, that we're not reading a fairy tale.
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.560]   This is not fiction.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.260]   This is what we profess to believe.
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:19.840]   This is what we sing about.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:24.920]   These are the memory verses that you're studying, that without the blood of Christ covering
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:28.280]   their sins, the lake of fire is what is waiting them.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.280]   The second death is what's waiting them.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.280]   It's not their first death.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:38.760]   We get so caught up when non-Christians get sick and pray for their healing, but that's
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.120]   not their real problem.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:42.120]   Their real problem is not the first death.
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:48.520]   It's not the real problem that they didn't get to live 80 years instead of 10 years or
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.840]   whatever.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:55.480]   The real problem is that there's a second death waiting for them if they do not believe
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:46:00.960]   the gospel of Jesus Christ, if they are not atoned for for their sins.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:06.240]   So I don't know, and I think all of you will agree with me, there's nothing more urgent
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:10.440]   to the church than the salvation of the lost.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.600]   We're going to worship in heaven.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:15.920]   We're going to fellowship in heaven.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.160]   Our tears are going to be wiped away.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.040]   Our tears are not the greatest problems in our life because our tears are going to be
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.200]   wiped away when we get to heaven.
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.040]   All our loneliness are going to be wiped away.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:29.280]   All the problems that you and I have during this lifetime are going to be nothing because
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:34.400]   we know no matter how bad this world gets that when Christ comes, all that is going
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.400]   to be gone.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:40.920]   So no matter what problem consumes us in light of who Christ is, in light of eternity, it
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:41.920]   really is not.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:46.680]   It's very trivial because it's temporary.
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:54.560]   The real problem around us are the non-Christians, even the rich Christians, even the healthy
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:59.160]   Christians, even the healthy non-Christians.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:03.600]   Their problem is a million times more worse than whatever it is that we're struggling
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.040]   with.
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:10.280]   So my hope and prayer is that as we continue to study and meditate that there will be a
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:16.680]   sense of spiritual urgency of the truth that we profess and sing every single day.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:22.080]   So the three questions I asked you to discuss, one is how often do you think about sharing
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.040]   the gospel with the lost around you?
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:27.880]   Why do you think so many Christians make so little effort in sharing the gospel with the
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.800]   lost?
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:33.280]   Are there anyone close to you in your life that you are not sure if they really understand
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.040]   the gospel?
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:39.960]   So this is the difference between have they heard the gospel?
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:42.480]   If you go out on the street and you ask people, "Have you heard the gospel?"
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.220]   A lot of people will say yes.
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:48.860]   This question is do they actually understand the gospel?
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:53.980]   So our responsibility is to make sure they understand it, not simply that they heard
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:54.980]   it.
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:55.980]   Do they understand?
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:01.580]   Does everybody in your life, whether they accept it or not, at least understand what
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:05.020]   it is that you believe?
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.900]   Or do they say, "Well, that's good for you.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.900]   I have my own thing."
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.700]   But they don't really know what it is that you believe.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.380]   Are there people like that in your life?
[00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:17.460]   Three, take some time to pray together for the lost in your life and also make a practical
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:20.540]   application to share the gospel with them in the near future.
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:24.820]   So the most practical thing is not to simply feel guilty.
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:29.500]   We can leave this room saying, "Yeah, I should, but thank God I'm saved by grace."
[00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:31.740]   And then the end.
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:33.100]   I hope that's not what we do.
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.780]   I hope what we do is to actively.
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:41.700]   We're not going to become evangelists like the greatest evangelists overnight, but at
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:43.740]   least take steps.
[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:46.340]   First thing is to pray.
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:52.100]   Identify who those people are, pray for them, and practically when and how will you share
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:55.300]   the gospel with them and make a practical application.
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:57.300]   Hopefully you'll be able to do that in your small group.
[00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:58.300]   Okay?
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:04.140]   Let me pray for us and then I'll release you to your group.
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:08.780]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your living word that judges the thoughts and intentions
[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:10.700]   of our heart.
[00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:16.820]   You know how easily we are entangled, Lord God, with our own thoughts, with our own pity
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:20.300]   parties, Lord God, of what we don't have.
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:26.420]   Lord, we know and we profess that we have everything in you.
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:31.900]   We know, Father God, that eternity is coming where we will be in your presence to know
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:39.500]   your glory for eternity, Lord God, to be affected by the cross and what you've done.
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:43.540]   But meanwhile, while we're here, help us to live soberly.
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:48.780]   Help us, Lord God, to think soberly of the people who do not know you yet, whose sins,
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:52.900]   Lord God, are binding them, are reigning over their lives.
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:56.100]   And in the end, where judgment will come.
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.940]   Help us to have compassion for their souls.
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:04.540]   Help us to remember where we were before we met you so that we would actively pursue them,
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:05.540]   Lord God.
[00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:09.900]   Help us, Lord, to live with perspective, perspective of who you are, perspective of
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:12.500]   what we've been reading and studying.
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:16.420]   I pray that you would bless our small group time, that you would cause us, Lord God, to
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:18.460]   be spiritual sober in all that we do.
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:20.220]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
