[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   I'm going to read for us Philippians chapter 2 verses 1 through 5.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.760]   So if you could turn there with me.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.520]   Hopefully for those of you who have been here, Philippians is very near and dear to you now
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.680]   as you've studied through inductively.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.440]   God's word says, "Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.000]   of love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion, make
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.520]   my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit,
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.580]   intent on one purpose.
[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.920]   Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.280]   as more important than yourselves.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.920]   Do not merely look out for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.080]   Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus."
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:03.200]   Let's pray.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.640]   God thank you that you have given Christ to be our example.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.320]   That he is indeed God.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.600]   And God we're so grateful that Christ too is indeed man.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.720]   Who walked the walk, who understands our weaknesses, who is able to sympathize with where we are.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.880]   That we might look to him and be encouraged by the fact that he understands.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.460]   But also very stirred on and stirred up God by the fact that he was able to live that
[00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.480]   righteous life for us.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:43.120]   So thank you God that as we hear today's sermon, we have his example and we have his work completed
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.400]   for us.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.160]   That we might hear with renewed hearts.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.840]   And God for anyone who's not a believer in this room, that you would allow their eyes
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.840]   to see.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.400]   A Jesus who has died for the sins of the world.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.760]   And God that you would cause living hope to come.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.480]   And Father that eyes that were once blind to see.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.920]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.920]   We're gonna be continuing in our covenant series.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.640]   Today is covenant number six.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.720]   And I'll read it for us.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.480]   It says, "I commit to attending BCC," that's Beroean Community Church, "functions and activities
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.680]   to the best of my ability for the purpose of building up the body of Christ at Berean."
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.080]   I'll read it one more time.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.120]   "I commit to attending BCC functions and activities to the best of my ability for the purpose
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.440]   of building up the body of Christ at Berean."
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.200]   And with these covenants, if you are new, if you haven't been here before, we have a
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.140]   series of 10 covenants.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.240]   And all 10 of them, if you're a member, try to imagine the 10.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.640]   There's 10 of them and then you sign your name at the bottom if you wanna become a member
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.160]   here at Berean.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.400]   And these are covenants that you commit to.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.360]   To say that this is where your heart is.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.680]   And number six is going to be one of those.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.800]   And the main point for today's sermon, I'll just give it right up front.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.720]   Church functions and activities are not about you.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.600]   That's our main point today.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.600]   It's not about you.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.920]   They are about building up the body of Christ and edifying others.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.080]   Again, church functions and activities are not about you.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.640]   They are about building up the body of Christ and edifying others.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.880]   And today's sermon, we have to be a little wary.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.360]   I think there's a very easy kind of road we could go down where it seems like I'm legalistically
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.480]   preaching at you to say like, "Hey, you have to come out to everything that this church
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.080]   says you have to come out to."
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.560]   No, that is not what we're saying.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.980]   Far from it actually.
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.720]   But today I invite you to come and just evaluate your heart and to say that we're not going
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.760]   to be people who look and say, "Do I have to go to this?
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.400]   Do I have to go to that?"
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.280]   These functions and activities that are provided here.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.280]   But to say perhaps coming from a different angle and maybe challenging you to ask different
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.360]   questions instead of those.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.200]   So let's try to navigate these waters a little bit.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.560]   Now, I wrote out for you guys some fellowship and activities that we have here at our church.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.920]   These are just a few.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.160]   These are just some examples.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.160]   Christmas parties.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.400]   In December, it felt like there were so many Christmas parties, right?
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.840]   You had to buy like six gift exchange things.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.160]   Sports day, we had that recently or actually we called it picnic day.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.160]   Keep forgetting.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.760]   And then game nights.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.200]   There are different ones that kind of pop up.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.120]   Retreats.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.560]   Praise and prayer nights.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.560]   Special services.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.400]   The New Year's Eve service was especially encouraging to me personally.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.960]   We had that New Year's Eve service counting down together.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.800]   Always feels kind of cheesy, kind of awesome.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   Prayer meetings.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.720]   That's happening on Sundays.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.600]   We have praise and prayers and things like that.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   Sports activities.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   Football.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.240]   I think football season is kind of gearing up right now and I see a lot of people having
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.720]   interesting lunches and dinners together and stuff like that.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.720]   So there's a lot of different functions, a lot of different activities.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.480]   I'd say specifically given by Berea and also some that are more just loose, that people
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.960]   are kind of getting together.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.000]   And these are the things that we're talking about.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.880]   Now for me, I want to just get out there and let you know that I'm an introvert.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.480]   I'm pretty introverted.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.680]   Social interaction scares me.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.680]   So I had to learn the cues and all that kind of stuff.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.200]   And going down this list and even preparing the sermon, I had to do a lot of heart evaluation
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.520]   too for myself.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.640]   So I hope you understand that rather than preaching at you today, there was a lot of
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.640]   thought I had to put into myself.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.000]   Even just getting to retreat, there's a college retreat coming up.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.840]   If you're an introvert, you know retreats are your worst nightmare.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:59.720]   You like the sessions and you like the times in small groups, but anything in between,
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.000]   you want to just go to your room.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   So there's all these things that about me, when I think of church activities and functions,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.720]   I get different feels.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.920]   I kind of look at this and I say, I say I want to go to that.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.880]   I look at this and I say, "Ooh, that one is not something I would want to be at."
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.400]   When I first came out to this church, Wednesday night Bible studies were the scariest thing
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.400]   for me.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.600]   Wednesday night Bible study, there would be almost like 200 people, like 150 to 200 people
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.880]   here.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.200]   And then that thought of, "Man, who do I talk to?
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   Where do I belong?
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.800]   Am I supposed to feel like I need to belong somewhere?"
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.760]   All these different conflicting things were there.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.760]   And so, I don't want you to get me wrong, I like interacting with people.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.480]   I actually like talking with you and things like that.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.840]   That's all there.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.760]   And yet, as we think about functions and activities, for every person sitting in this room, we
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.840]   get different feelings.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.120]   We have different struggles.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.440]   There are people who want to go out to anything and everything.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.840]   And there are people who it's difficult to come out to these things.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.800]   So today's sermon, please evaluate it to your own heart.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.520]   I want to ask you, don't be thinking about other people as much as possible as you're
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.180]   going through today's sermon, and try to be evaluating and thinking about where you personally
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.520]   and currently stand.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.120]   So again, let me read covenant number six.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.120]   "I commit to attending BCC functions and activities to the best of my ability for the purpose
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.120]   of building up the body of Christ at Berean."
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.840]   I'm going to go through four points.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.880]   Here's the first.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.680]   Believers must be others-focused.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.360]   Believers must be others-focused.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.320]   So again, for members at BCC, we ask you to commit to this.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.800]   You're signing your name to this, and that you're making it more than optional in your
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.800]   life.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.160]   The word there is commitment.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.260]   This is your word.
[00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:06.160]   You have signed it with your name, saying, "This is what I desire and commit to do."
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.940]   Obviously, this isn't mandatory.
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.580]   The words, "To the best of your ability."
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.200]   That one, it makes that clear.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.540]   But the idea is that we are truly committed to even taking these functions and activities
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:25.520]   that are provided at church seriously.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.160]   The question, though, becomes, "Why?
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.480]   Why should I?"
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.760]   If you're the type of heart, I kind of have a heart like this.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.200]   When someone tells me what to do, I kind of want to buck the other way.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.200]   You have to ask that question, "Why?"
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.880]   Says who?
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:47.500]   That doesn't sound like ... It takes a little bit of work to make that sound and feel biblical.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.900]   Come out to the functions and activities that this church provides.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.120]   It sounds legalistic at times.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.360]   You can say, "I'm coming to Bible study."
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.040]   You can say, "I'm coming out to weeknight, the home group," or, "I'm coming out to Sunday
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.040]   worships.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.400]   I'm putting in what I need to put in.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.640]   I'm a very busy person."
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:16.080]   Your heart might say, "Can I not pick and choose on these optional functions and activities?"
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.320]   My answer to that would be, "Of course.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.520]   Of course you're allowed to choose.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.520]   Of course you need to take stock of your life.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:29.280]   You need to wisely and discerningly be able to make these decisions, to see in your life
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.640]   what you are capable of being a part of and not.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.640]   Of course."
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.560]   But today, we're not asking that.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.120]   What we're asking is, "Where is your heart in the decision-making process?
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.920]   What makes you say, 'I will go to this, I will not go to this?'
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.960]   Where is the beginning point?
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.680]   Where is the starting point of how your heart reflexes in these things?"
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:59.800]   The idea here is, "To the best of my ability.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.240]   I'm going to be trying to go to these things to the best of my ability."
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:09.360]   Now there's a difference between someone that really wants to make it but can't, and then
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:17.500]   someone that will take any and every excuse before saying that they'll go.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.800]   For an example, a parent might ask their teenage child, so if you have a teenage child, you
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.040]   are fully aware of this.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.040]   You know what I'm talking about.
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.440]   When they go through puberty, and then they become kind of a different creature, and then
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.080]   you start asking them, before it'd be like, "We're going here," and all the kids would
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.240]   go, "Yeah!"
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.120]   But now they're too cool for school.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.120]   They have friends.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.400]   They don't need you so much anymore.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.080]   You're this parent of a teenager, and you're asking that question to them.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.280]   "Hey, come to your sibling's birthday dinner this Sunday."
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.360]   You ask that question to them.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.380]   And now here is where a lot of responses can come out.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:01.000]   And here is where you can start to really gauge the heart of this child you have, this
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.560]   teenager.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.080]   One is, he will really try his best, because that's what he says.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.800]   He says, "Okay, okay, Mom.
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.800]   I'll try my best."
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.840]   So, he will really try his best.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.320]   He's going to work hard to get his assignments done.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:25.320]   He's going to keep his schedule clear when his friends invite him to a movie.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:31.680]   His priority is going to be seen in his commitment to what he said, "I'll try my best."
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.560]   And then, there's this other side.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.800]   We could think about it the epidemic of the age, which is this.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:44.040]   "I'll try my best" falls on a spectrum, on a category, a bunch of categories.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:48.760]   It actually means, "I'll try my best until something better and more worth my time comes
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.760]   along."
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:56.880]   Now, this is very like that example of this teenager processing that.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:02.480]   "My parents just asked me to come to this sibling birthday dinner."
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.480]   And they're like in a twilight zone for a little bit, right?
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.320]   They're kind of in there trying to make their decision.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:12.440]   And there's a lot of desires happening, there's a lot of thoughts happening in that process.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.040]   What might this individual say?
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.360]   Until something better and more worth my time comes along.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.000]   If it's a hangout with acquaintances that I don't necessarily like, I'm thrilled about
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.520]   hanging out with, then I will be there.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.200]   I will make the sacrifice to go and be at this dinner.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:35.520]   However, if it's with a group of friends that he really likes to be with, if that girl he
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.840]   has a crush on happens to be there, if that thing that they're going to be doing just
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:46.240]   sounds too exciting, then all of a sudden, sorry, I can't make it to the birthday dinner.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.240]   Or it might depend on many different things.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.620]   So I'll try my best.
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:56.500]   That gets relegated to, depends on what's in it for me.
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.400]   What do I deem to be most in line with my desire?
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.120]   How is that going to benefit me?
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:11.960]   I'll prioritize my family until something of a really greater priority comes along.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.960]   So the question isn't so much, not like, why should I go to this thing?
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.400]   But the question we should be asking is, why would I not?
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.040]   It kind of delves.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.760]   The teenager that goes in these two opposite directions, the one that the priorities aren't
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.000]   right, they're going to be like, why should I go?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.560]   The one who is really, who loves their family, who wants to be there is going to ask, oh,
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.560]   why would I not?
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.560]   It comes from a different angle.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.280]   And we're going to look at that.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:45.760]   The questions that come up about how you answer that question, about how you answer the question
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.080]   if someone says, hey, are you going to be here?
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.920]   Are you going to be at that thing?
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.720]   It's going to evaluate your core heart intentions.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.040]   It's going to shed light on your heart desires.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.200]   And covenant six goes into this.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.200]   Covenant six says, prioritize the church.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.200]   Prioritize fellowship.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.640]   Prioritize spending time with each other.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.520]   Prioritize others.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.160]   Don't use church.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:21.000]   Don't use others to build up your securities and your desires.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Prioritize them.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.240]   Love them.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.560]   These functions and activities are not about you.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:34.080]   Now, of course, we have to take a side and say, of course it's about you.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.080]   It's about all of us.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.120]   Those things are supposed to be beneficial for each and every one of us.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:44.000]   The idea here is that that function and that activity is not for you as an individual so
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.240]   much as it is for the edification of the body and of the church.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.200]   Church functions are not about you.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:15:02.840]   We are concerned about the building up of the church, not individual self-interests.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:08.040]   You are not to be simply consumed about your spiritual growth.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:14.480]   The way we are now is we are concerned about the church's spiritual growth.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.200]   So the passage in Philippians chapter two, verses one through five, I'm going to read
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.200]   this again.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.080]   "Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.640]   love, if there is any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion, make my joy
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:30.400]   complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.240]   one purpose.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:37.580]   Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind, regard one another
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.920]   as more important than yourselves.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.180]   Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:48.520]   Have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus."
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:53.480]   And of course from there it goes into verses six through 11, that amazing passage about
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.760]   what Jesus did.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:02.400]   But if you look here, he starts off this passage by saying, "If, if, if, if," four times.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.600]   He says, "If there is encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.320]   of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion."
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.840]   And that word "if" is important.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.600]   There are different ways you could take the word "if," "if" statements.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.960]   There are actually four general conditional statements, but we'll just look at two.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:29.080]   The second conditional, the condition two is, if it becomes, next slide here, there
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.200]   is doubt as to whether these things exist or not.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.160]   And this is not the passage.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.120]   This passage isn't doubting the existence of these four things.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:44.760]   This is actually a conditional one statement, which is going to be, can you guys put that
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.760]   up?
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.320]   I'm going to write that down.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.320]   There is no doubt that these things do exist.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.840]   So it is, there is no doubt that the things that are being talked about in the list of
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.240]   four things, that they exist.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:03.240]   So another way you can replace "if" with is, "therefore," or you could replace it with,
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.240]   "since."
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.560]   It becomes very causal in effect, condition one.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.800]   "Because," you can say "because" too.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:14.720]   So looking at this text again, "Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ,"
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.720]   can be read, "Therefore, since there is encouragement in Christ, because there is consolation of
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:28.400]   love, because you have these things," in verse two, "make my joy complete by being in the
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:35.080]   same mind, being unified in thought, being unified in heart, coming together as one."
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:41.200]   And from there, it goes into the exhortations of verses three and four.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.840]   He's saying, "Do you not have love from God?
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.800]   Do you not have the fellowship given from the Lord?
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:55.560]   That if you do, then this is how you ought to look."
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:03.680]   So in verse three, he says that we are to do nothing out of selfish ambition or empty
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.840]   conceit.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:10.080]   That word "nothing" is very powerful.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.480]   That word ought to highlight and jump out at us.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:21.720]   Because this is the type of command where you can't wiggle out of it.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.960]   We like using loopholes in commandments.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.120]   When God commands us to do something, we use loopholes.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:33.320]   The weakness of the flesh, the fact that I forgot, there's lots of different loopholes
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.320]   we can use.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:42.800]   But when he says, "Do nothing out of selfishness," think about the gravity and weight of that
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.440]   statement.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:52.040]   Another way to look at that is, don't even do one thing out of selfishness.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:19:00.640]   The things you say, the things you do, the decisions you make, none of it, zero.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.680]   All of it has to be gone.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:10.720]   The decisions you make cannot come out of selfishness.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.360]   Are you not a believer?
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.400]   Have you not received the love of the Lord?
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:21.440]   Will you not see what's to come right after this passage of how Christ set an example
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.160]   for us?
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.080]   He did not just think of you a little bit.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.600]   He did not think of you just a little bit higher or more.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:34.000]   He died for you.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.360]   And this passage, do nothing out of selfishness.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.160]   Do nothing out of empty conceit.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.920]   Another way to say empty conceit is vain glory.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:46.080]   I really like that one because it kind of sheds light on it, right?
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.200]   Do nothing from self-glory.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.960]   Do nothing to bring glory to yourself.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:20:01.200]   But in humility, consider others' interests more important than your own.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.320]   This passage speaks loads into covenant number six and why it matters.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.780]   I commit to attending BCC functions and activities to the best of my ability for the purpose
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:15.280]   of building up the body of Christ at Berean.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.360]   We're not here just to like do Bible study together, hear sermons together, and go our
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.360]   way.
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:27.960]   A church is just this part of our lives where we come and it's there.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:34.280]   And we have to kind of categorize everything in our lives and put up boundaries and say,
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.320]   "Well, I know I'm called to be a good Christian."
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:45.800]   See, we're not called to be here and just be polite Christians and nice Christians.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:51.320]   Come and kind of Sunday to Sunday basis look at each other and say, "Hey, how are you doing?"
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.240]   And talk a little bit about what's been happening in the week and maybe bring up something that
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.600]   happened last week.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:01.540]   Church is so much more than that.
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:07.280]   When we're called to be believers, when we are called into God's kingdom and we are transformed
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:12.680]   from who we used to be to who we are now as believers, church becomes a place when you
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:17.560]   gather these types of people together that it looks dramatically different.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:24.680]   See, Covenant 6 is a tangible way to live Philippians 2, verses 3 and 4 out.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:31.380]   It gives you space and opportunity to live in obedience to God, in caring for one another,
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.080]   in thinking of others.
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:38.280]   We don't have various functions and activities here at Berean because we like functions and
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.280]   activities.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:47.200]   Personally, for me, I just like talking to people and then I don't know how to small
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.960]   talk very well.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:54.840]   I like getting to the deeper things and all that kind of stuff.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:22:03.280]   But these functions and activities, when we kind of take stock of them, we can't say,
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:08.720]   "Well, in them of themselves, of course, programs aren't what runs the church.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.680]   They're not the most important thing."
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:20.640]   And yet, these things are both very helpful and secondly, it's going to kind of help you
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:25.160]   to evaluate actually where you do stand personally.
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:33.680]   Whether you desire to go or not, we'll be able to help you ask yourself, "Why?
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.340]   Why don't I want to go to this?
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:42.700]   Why would I want to go to this?"
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:47.240]   We aren't saying, obviously, that you need to be at every single thing the church provides.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:53.520]   I know many of us are incredibly busy and honestly, sometimes it does feel like...
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.120]   Church does feel like, "Man, you're running to one thing to another thing."
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.680]   And I know many of you guys are doing that.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.440]   You're going to a meeting and then you're going to some kind of outing and then you're
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.440]   going to...
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.440]   I know.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.280]   I know it gets crazy.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:09.280]   But we do need to evaluate our hearts and how we decide and why we decide to go to all
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.100]   of these things.
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.840]   These are opportunities to build each other up and edify one another.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:19.580]   That list I had written up there before, these are great spaces.
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.860]   These are great opportunities.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:27.240]   If there is anyone in this room that has ever sat down and said, "Man, I don't feel like
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.800]   I have fellowship here.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.040]   I don't feel like I have friends here.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.440]   I don't feel welcomed here.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.720]   I don't feel at home here."
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:38.960]   These are the places for that.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:44.120]   And how you make your decisions will show you where your heart is.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:48.440]   There's something heavy and weighty that describes the believer that has been saved by God.
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.280]   Because when you're thinking of like, "Why would I go to this or not?"
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.560]   And you're thinking about Philippians chapter two, verse three or four, that I would consider
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.400]   others' interests above my own.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.360]   This is not a nice thought of, "I need to think of others a little bit more."
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:08.240]   This is saying that you need to think of others greater than yourself.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:15.520]   That what I deem in my defense and my survival instincts and my desire for self-satisfaction,
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:21.240]   all these things, it's not like thinking of other people just a little bit more.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:27.800]   This is like a complete change, a drastic difference in the believer.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:32.520]   Look what it says in John 13, 35, "By this, all people will know that you are my disciples,
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.440]   if you have love for one another."
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:43.860]   If you have love for one another, they will know that you are my disciples.
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:47.040]   When something comes up on an announcement, Pastor Mark usually gives announcements and
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.600]   he puts it out there saying, "This thing is coming up."
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.920]   Like, what's your process?
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.000]   Is it quickly like, "Oh, not going to that, not going to that one.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Oh, I'll consider that one.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.120]   That one I'm definitely going to."
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.960]   And again, it's not about the function all the time.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.080]   It's not about that activity all the time.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.720]   My question is to your own heart.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.480]   Why did you just cut these out?
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.800]   Why did you say maybe to this one?
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.320]   And why are you saying you're going to this one?
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:16.440]   Are you self-interested?
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.200]   Is your decision-making solely, even in functions and activities, about you?
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:28.480]   This brings us to our second point, believers must not be self-centered.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.480]   Believers must not be self-centered.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:39.440]   Now, if you're self-centered, you're going to say, "All right, what do I have to do?"
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.280]   Kind of like the teenager to the parent, right?
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.080]   "What do I have to do?
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.760]   Tell me what to do and I'll do it."
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.920]   And we know that's wrong.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:55.200]   It should come more from a heart of, "I desire."
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:26:01.840]   Here's some common questions that will tend to reveal your heart's desires.
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:05.360]   And we're talking specifically about functions and activities here, but you can talk about
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.200]   church in general.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.580]   Here's the first one.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.560]   You can ask, "Who's going?"
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.920]   I hate that one the most, by the way.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.920]   "Who's going?"
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.920]   Whenever someone asks me, "Who's going?"
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.920]   I'm like, "Not you."
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:18.920]   You know, "We don't want that kind of heart here."
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.920]   Just kidding.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.920]   Just kidding.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:21.920]   I'm totally kidding.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:22.920]   Please come.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.920]   But, "Who's going?"
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:36.500]   Not out of curiosity, but when this question is asked to gauge whether or not you want
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.640]   to go, like, "Who's going?"
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:45.520]   You can see the anti-God attitude there.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:50.400]   And it's actually quite ugly if you really sit back and think about it.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:58.960]   The attitude that is set against, I would say, is an anti-Christ mindset, the selfishness.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:03.560]   The attitude that doesn't fall in line with, "Look to others' interests above my own, but
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.680]   what's in it for me?
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.680]   What am I going to learn?
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.960]   What am I going to gain out of it?"
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:15.620]   The question is, "What are we going to do exactly?
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.640]   Can you please write down the itinerary and tell me exactly what we're going to do?
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.000]   And then I'll consider whether or not I'll be there or not."
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.880]   Again, not out of curiosity.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:30.160]   I know there are just curious people, the type of personalities that just wants to know
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.160]   everything.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:37.960]   But because you want to gauge whether I'll go or not.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.000]   Here's some common objections as to why not to go.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.680]   Your heart might say, "I'm too tired.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:48.720]   You have no idea what my week look like.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.520]   I am exhausted."
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:56.460]   And many times, it's extremely valid, that feeling.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:03.520]   But in your decision-making process, are you self-interested or are you others' interested?
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:08.440]   Are you self-centered or in humility, do you consider others' interests greater than your
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.920]   own?
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.080]   And that at least needs to be there, right?
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.800]   But is that questioning there?
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.640]   Is that sentiment there?
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:22.980]   That we are supremely as believers now, others-oriented.
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:32.160]   That our existence is to love God and to love others and to not love ourselves.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.120]   We might say something like, "It doesn't seem worth it."
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:41.480]   You might say, "I don't have any friends there."
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.400]   Again many of these can be valid in certain senses.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.760]   We can come up with very good excuses.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:52.800]   But how we go about it and the pattern as to why we make these decisions are going to
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   reveal your heart.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:58.200]   That's all I'm asking today for you to do.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.880]   I'm not trying to guilt you into going to activities and say, "You're not a good person
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.200]   unless you go to these things."
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.520]   No, far be it from that.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:13.840]   I'm humbly trying to say, "Just look at your heart and how are you making decisions?"
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:19.080]   When you ask yourself whether or not the way you make practical decisions in life, you're
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.640]   asking, "Is it biblical?"
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:28.040]   The way I even think about things, am I taking it into consideration?
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.000]   Am I taking every thought captive?
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:39.160]   Just the whole outlook of my life, what is it oriented around?
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:45.960]   And for many of us, I want to say all of us, there is that me-centered aspect.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:52.440]   Even how we serve in church, even what we decide to do, it's very self-centered.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.720]   But this is a reminder.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.800]   This is a high calling.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:04.320]   Do nothing out of selfishness or empty conceit.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:08.640]   We are bent on loving others in radical ways.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:12.000]   We place others' interests above our own.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.080]   How can we actively do that unless we put ourselves in position to do that?
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:23.320]   A church our size, I think it's very, very easy for us to just come and attend and go.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.720]   It's really easy.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.280]   And then even if you're a little bit more church, you're like, "I have to do something
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.640]   in the week too, so I'll go to the home group.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.760]   I'll go to some kind of Bible study."
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.960]   Come and then go.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:42.360]   But you could do that with extreme self-interest there.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.760]   The Christian just looks so different.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.480]   We're called to look very different than that.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:51.920]   The Christian comes and says, "Wherever they go, I will place others' interests above my
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.440]   own."
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:57.960]   If you don't believe me, if you just think I'm taking one passage, if you just go through
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:02.880]   text, if you go through just the New Testament, you are going to be riddled with command after
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.480]   command after command to do that.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.240]   And we'll take a look at that pretty soon.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:13.600]   So we have to be very different in the way we react and we think, and we have to renew
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.680]   those things.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.920]   If you look at Ephesians chapter four, verse 20 through 24, it says, "But you did not learn
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:20.920]   Christ in this way.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.720]   Indeed, you have heard him and have been taught in him, just as truth is in Jesus, that in
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:29.920]   reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self."
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.040]   That former manner of life, we'll put in there selfishness.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.560]   We'll put in there self-centeredness.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:39.920]   And he's saying, "In reference to your former manner of life," that's how you used to be
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:45.120]   before Christ, before the Holy Spirit came into you, before you were changed and renewed
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.320]   and resurrected in the soul.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:52.240]   He says, "You lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:57.520]   lust of the seed, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind and put on the
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:02.440]   new self, which is in the likeness of," not just a betterment of personality or people
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:07.360]   or just thinking more of others, but to the likeness of God has been created in righteousness
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:11.520]   and holiness of the truth.
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:18.760]   The standard we're called to is Christlikeness, that we are to look to others and be Christlike
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:23.320]   in our thoughts, that we are to look at these decisions we can make in our lives, even to
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:28.800]   our time, and be Christlike.
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:35.480]   Then in Philippians, after our passage, he goes to the sheer extent of what Christ did
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.760]   as an example.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:44.480]   He went to the cross, and that is the way we think now.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:50.640]   That is the way we make our decisions now, that we have been crucified to ourselves and
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:57.760]   to our own desires, that we live singularly for one purpose now.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:09.120]   Our heart, our hope, our joy is all put together fully in God and his purposes now.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:16.720]   The old has gone, the new has come, and we are actively renewing in this.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.440]   Hopefully the put on the new self takes off the burden, because when you look, you say
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:25.780]   like, "Oh man, I'm a Christian, and I don't quite look like this," and it scares you,
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:29.880]   but this is a reminder that Paul is talking to Christians, and he's giving this command
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.400]   to people who ought to look a certain way.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.840]   He's saying, "You don't look like that."
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.480]   That's for all of us.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.000]   We do exist in this place where we're weak.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   We are selfish.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.040]   We repent of that, but my question is, do you truly repent of that?
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:51.000]   Have you been turning your eyes away from living for yourself, and have you been even
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.320]   within the church, not just between you and God, saying, "I want to live for your kingdom,
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.100]   so my career is about you, God."
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:03.000]   Not just that, but even in the way we look at each other, everything has been sanctified
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.720]   and washed.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:11.560]   That brings us to our third point, believers must build one another up.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:15.040]   We have to learn this intentional and purposeful type of interaction that comes as a result
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:18.480]   of our new life in Christ.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.360]   These interactions that we have, it could be all over the spectrum again.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.040]   I'll throw out random examples, but you have to make this your own.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:29.080]   You can have the interactions where you just have a close group of friends here at church,
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:32.360]   and you guys just go and hang out all the time because it's very comfortable, and there's
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:36.480]   good conversations that happen, and maybe even some spurring on that happens in those
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:45.760]   things, and that's good, but only to a certain degree because that could be quickly taken
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.760]   selfishly and made into something ugly.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:54.960]   But the people who are like, "There are no intentional conversations going on.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.320]   No one's welcoming me.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:04.860]   I have no choice but to feel like I've got to run to my car and leave."
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:11.220]   For you too, we look at this and we see that this is not the way we are called as Christians
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:12.880]   to take things.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:20.320]   When we're saved, we're saved into a group, a group of people.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:26.600]   In 1 Peter 2, we heard a few weeks back about we're all living stones, that we're part of
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.800]   a building.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:31.240]   Later on in that passage, he talks about us as a nation.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:34.880]   We are a people chosen of God.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:39.440]   In 1 Corinthians 12, that we're a body.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.640]   Most of the yous that you find in the New Testament, when it says you, they're mostly
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:44.640]   plural.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.920]   If you're not sure if it's singular or plural, it's probably plural.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:56.280]   God doesn't so much address the individual as he addresses a people.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:04.980]   The way we think now, even when we read scripture then, it's not like me, it's more us.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.520]   It's not individualistic, it's corporate.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.920]   Our new lives are found in loving God and others, not self.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:16.960]   If we're to think of body parts again, I know Pastor Mark talked about it a little bit,
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.160]   but I was trying to think of an example.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.960]   The idea, body works so well.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.120]   There is no hand that is selfish.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:32.560]   If someone was to come at me and then they put up their dukes and then they wind up and
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:37.240]   then they're about to punch me, there is no hand that says, "Ooh, let the face get hit.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.800]   I don't want to get hit."
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.000]   There's no hand that does that.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   What happens?
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.040]   Reactively, what happens?
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.120]   The hand goes and says, "I will take the impact.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:53.880]   I will take the brunt of that punch."
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:37:01.240]   That idea of us being a part of the body, I try and I put myself up to that standard
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:06.800]   and I put our church up to that standard and I wonder, what is our reaction?
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:12.400]   Are we self-centered?
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.160]   Are we self-interested people?
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:19.800]   That church has become a nice place and so it just feels very polite.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.520]   I can't figure out another...
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:28.040]   I'm trying to grapple with this feeling in me, but church feels very polite sometimes.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:33.800]   Very organized and there's compartments that says, "Well, come and go."
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:37.760]   So overall, sometimes it can feel that way.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:42.800]   And then, there's this part of me where I see the spirit at work and I get so encouraged
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.720]   by our church.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.040]   People who are just diving into each other's lives, who are weeping with each other, rejoicing
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.520]   with each other, going above and beyond, who are sharpening each other.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.560]   I see people praying together.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:00.640]   I see people on their own volition going through different books and memorizing different passages
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:06.000]   and like, "Wow."
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.960]   But more, we need to be greedy about this.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:13.240]   We need more of that.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.120]   Do nothing out of selfishness.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:21.880]   If we see even one iota of that, we gotta be like, "No, get that out of our church."
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.960]   Philippians 2, 1 through 4.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:31.600]   If you look at verse 3, "Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind,
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.560]   regard one another as more important than yourself.
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:37.160]   Do not merely look out for your own personal interest, but also for the interests of others.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.920]   Have the attitude of Christ."
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:45.240]   And the New Testament, if you go to the next slide here.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.240]   Don't try to read it.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.880]   I know it's hard.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:52.600]   But these are what you call the one and others and you look at every single one of these
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.600]   are commands.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.600]   Here's a few.
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:55.600]   "Be at peace with one another.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.600]   Watch one another's feet.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.280]   Love one another a bunch of times.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.800]   Be devoted, honor, live in harmony with one another.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.280]   Stop passing judgment on one another.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.280]   Accept one another."
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.920]   And it goes on and on.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.880]   You could go through the next two slides and you'll see it here and here.
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.880]   And it keeps going.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.880]   It's all over.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:15.320]   Now, each of these are commands to us.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:19.200]   All of these are commands that tell you to obey.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:24.000]   Again, putting ourselves up to not the standard of just like trying to be a good Christian,
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.120]   but to the standard of God's Word.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:30.880]   When we come across it, you cannot read scripture without realizing like the otherness that
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:36.840]   has to be in our spirituality.
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:42.760]   If we constantly feel like we've just been treating church as like come and go and not
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:48.080]   really a big part of our lives, then we have to ask, "Have I been living in disobedience?"
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:52.040]   Because as long as I'm reading scripture, like these things are popping up in every
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.800]   book.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:55.800]   Where have I...
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:00.960]   You know, like have I really been outdoing a brother and showing honor?
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:06.200]   Like, just glanced over it, like just means I got to love brothers.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.480]   But have I actively been applying these things?
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.480]   Let's just look at that.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.480]   Let's look at Romans 12.
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:15.240]   Verse four, it says, "For as in one body we have many members, and the members do not
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.400]   all have the same function."
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:20.480]   So we though many are one body in Christ and individually members one of another.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.960]   Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:27.520]   If prophecy and proportion to our faith, if service and our serving, the one who teaches
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:31.200]   in his teaching, the one who exhorts in his exhortation, the one who contributes in generosity,
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.960]   the one who leads with zeal, the one who does acts of mercy with cheerfulness, let love
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.160]   be genuine.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.400]   Even just that command, man, let love be genuine.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.560]   Abhor what is evil, hold fast to what is good.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:43.560]   Love one another.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.560]   Here's one of the one another's.
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.400]   Love one another with brotherly affection.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.120]   Outdo one another in showing honor.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:52.280]   Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord.
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.880]   Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer, contribute to the needs
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.320]   of the saints, and seek to show hospitality.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.600]   If we have gotten really good when we think about functions and activities and the way
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.280]   we decide whether to go to things or not, again, it's not about those things.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.480]   It's about an evaluation of your own heart.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:11.140]   Have you been living for others?
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:17.160]   Have you been really seeking to make other interests better than your own, or have you
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:22.280]   been compartmentalizing, creating boundaries, and making all these things to fit church
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:30.720]   into the agenda of your life rather than seeing the body and its needs, rather than seeing
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:35.280]   the church and desiring her growth?
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:47.980]   These commands command us because it says that that is who we are now.
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:53.980]   If our entire mindset has been devoid of pursuing deep and real relationships and thinking of
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:42:00.500]   ourselves, this is a call to us.
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.900]   Don't think I'm talking to any one person.
[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:07.340]   I believe this applies to every single person.
[00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:11.740]   When it comes to church, what is your mindset?
[00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:15.020]   When opportunities are provided to you, what is your mentality?
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:19.380]   Are you others-focused?
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:25.300]   How do you approach the decisions, whether you can make it or not?
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.300]   But there's traffic.
[00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:30.420]   Yeah, I know.
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:32.100]   I live far too.
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.100]   I know.
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.100]   It's tough.
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:41.020]   Again, I'm trying my best here not to come off like, I hope I'm not coming off arrogant
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:44.860]   or like some weird kind of authoritative type of thing.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.900]   I'm asking you to just evaluate your heart.
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:51.060]   I'm not saying you got to come out to everything.
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:58.180]   Just think.
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:02.540]   Question is, is it okay or not?
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:06.140]   Is it okay for me to miss this one or things like that?
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.500]   But the question is always God-centered, right?
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.820]   Does this glorify God?
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:12.860]   How can I build others up?
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.260]   And then you need to bring in your wisdom.
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:17.900]   You need to bring in your discerning mind to really think through it.
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:19.540]   And maybe there's something she can't come out to.
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:20.620]   And that's good.
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:25.660]   If you were able to do that to the glory of God, that's good.
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:29.620]   But this isn't a sermon that's meant to say like now we have a reason to all judge each
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:32.740]   other and point at each other and say, "Oh, you didn't come out to this thing.
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.940]   You selfish person."
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:36.020]   That's not what we're called to do here.
[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:38.100]   That's just annoying.
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:39.940]   The picture again is of that teenage child.
[00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:45.260]   When the parent asked this child to come to his brother's birthday dinner, the parent
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:50.260]   doesn't want a bunch of questions that come from a self-centered worldview.
[00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:51.860]   How long is it going to be?
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:56.940]   Dude, you're like, "Come on.
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:57.940]   Why that question?
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:58.940]   It's too late."
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:08.620]   The parent asks, "Aren't you a part of this family?
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:11.740]   Don't you love spending time with us?
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:15.380]   Don't you love your brother?"
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:20.420]   To put it into the lingo of Philippians chapter two, the conditional statements, right?
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:25.580]   If you're a part of this family, if you received the love and care and concern and affection
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:31.100]   of Christ as well as all of us, if we have experienced life together, if we do truly
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:37.020]   care for each other and you say that we love one another as Christ loved us, if, then think
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.660]   of others better than yourselves.
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:43.460]   It almost contradicts each other in like that first part would show that the second part,
[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.620]   the command should not have to be said.
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:51.860]   But because of our fallen flesh that we continue to reside in, we need to hear this.
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:58.740]   See, in this scenario, even if this teenager sacrifices and comes to this dinner, who sees
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:03.900]   it as a duty and says like, "Just tell me what I need to do and I'll do it."
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.180]   That teenager, again, if you're a parent of one of those teenagers, what do you see that
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.700]   child doing?
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:11.700]   All dinner long, phone.
[00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:13.620]   All dinner long, checking the watch.
[00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:17.340]   As soon as the time is done, "Oh, dessert's done.
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:18.340]   See you later.
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:19.460]   Got my car.
[00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:20.460]   Getting out of here."
[00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.220]   You know?
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:28.460]   See, that individual can say, "See, I was there.
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:30.140]   Look, I sacrificed.
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.580]   See, I care."
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:35.580]   And just by his tone of voice, you're like, "You fool.
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.660]   No, you don't.
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:40.740]   You're a force to be here."
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:44.060]   And it shows everything about the heart sometimes.
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:47.420]   And so it is with Berean functions and activities, we desire for you to live out covenant number
[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:48.420]   six.
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:51.520]   I commit to attending BCC functions and activities to the best of my ability for the purpose
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.780]   of building up the body of Christ at Berean.
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:57.980]   Because you love the family.
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:59.780]   You want to live out the third vision.
[00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:04.060]   We really want to grow together in community and fellowship and accountability together.
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:06.220]   We love being together.
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:07.220]   We should not have to...
[00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:09.020]   The question isn't like, "Oh, why should I?
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:10.020]   What's in it for me?"
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:14.140]   It's like, "Man, we love each other."
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:18.980]   You know, I know you don't need to like volleyball.
[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:20.360]   You don't need to...
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:23.860]   You can look at your flimsy arms and say, "I have no power in me.
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:28.000]   I cannot pull that rope."
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.940]   You can even be allergic to grass and still come to All Church Picnic.
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:35.940]   Because it's not about you.
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:37.420]   You go and you participate.
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.780]   Yeah, participate as best you can.
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:40.780]   Be there.
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:42.620]   You have weak arms?
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:43.620]   Well, so do I.
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:46.220]   We'll pull it together.
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.340]   You plus me, we're strong.
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:49.340]   I don't know.
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:50.340]   I don't know what I'm saying.
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.820]   But this idea of like, "What's in it for me?
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:54.820]   What are we going to do?"
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.220]   Well, I don't really do that.
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:47:04.580]   I get very encouraged when people play volleyball and they suck.
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:07.780]   Because they're like, their heads are all hanging down and then there's always that
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:10.820]   one person who's a little bit too ambitious and too competitive.
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.500]   And they're like, "Get this girl off of here!"
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:14.500]   Things like that.
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:18.300]   But this person that's not good at volleyball, I love it.
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.540]   Because it shows that they're participating.
[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:22.660]   They're there.
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:27.820]   I can see they want to.
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.220]   And on the sidelines, I see them talking to people.
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.180]   I'm like, "This is good."
[00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:39.060]   I would love to see people allergic to grass who just, top to bottom, you just put clothes
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:41.620]   on.
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:42.620]   You put the gloves on.
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:48.340]   You do what you need to just be there.
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.700]   To the best of your ability.
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:50.700]   Have you been doing that?
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.540]   To the best of your ability.
[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:53.780]   Because you love the family.
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:54.780]   Because you care.
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:56.500]   Because you want to know how people are doing.
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.940]   Because you want to be with people.
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:05.460]   You can't expect to grow relationships by checking boxes.
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:11.820]   It's not any one activity or function or Bible study or Sunday worship that will grow a relationship.
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:18.860]   It's mutual desire to love, care for, and grow in another, sharpen each other.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:24.780]   These functions and activities are simply creating opportunities and space.
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:28.220]   So take advantage of them.
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:30.920]   Participate because other people enjoy it.
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:35.900]   And in that, maybe you can start to see that glimpse of, "I consider other interests more
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:36.900]   than my own."
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:42.740]   The goal is for us to participate in each other's lives.
[00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:44.580]   To put ourselves out there.
[00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:46.380]   To sacrifice for one another.
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:48.220]   To grow in vulnerability.
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:50.580]   To take down the high boundaries that we've set in our lives.
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:52.900]   To compartmentalize our relationships.
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:58.300]   This is very, very, very difficult in our day and age.
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:04.740]   It's so hard because we are simply so busy.
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:09.480]   So again, the answer, again, needs to be, is what I do out of a love for God and therefore
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.120]   a love for others.
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:12.120]   To build others up.
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:13.120]   To sharpen them.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:18.480]   To encourage, provoke, stir them up.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.280]   The image of, get Dean and June in your head, you know?
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.040]   Like to stir each other up.
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:28.300]   They burn forever into my mind.
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:35.020]   It's not about self-preservation, self-defense, self-satisfaction, self-infatuation, whatever.
[00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:38.940]   It's not about that.
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:41.980]   When we are self-loving, we can look and wonder why no one is welcoming me.
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:47.060]   Or we can look and judge others and say, "They're not being as welcoming as I am."
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:48.740]   It just goes all over the place.
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:54.600]   It's loophole after loophole after loophole to be self-centered, to be self-interested.
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:59.080]   All the good things that we think we're doing can very quickly become perverse if we don't
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:03.320]   come out of these things as believers who have been transformed and changed by the love
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:07.200]   of God.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.600]   So let's not just be friendly on Sundays.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:13.120]   Let's go beyond these things.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:17.660]   Let's try not to just come to church and do our due diligence and hop in our cars and
[00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:21.200]   get out as fast as possible so I can take my Sunday afternoon nap.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.760]   Oh, Sunday afternoon naps are glorious, right?
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:35.320]   But man, that time can be spent in other things too.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:41.640]   We can be people who constantly hear about what others are doing but don't want to share
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.560]   about ourselves when we're actually going through a difficulty.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:45.560]   That could be self-centered.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:52.480]   We can hide behind our spouses because they have a more out-there personality.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:51:01.160]   We can hide behind our children because people seem to like to talk about them.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:06.200]   We can give the timed excuse of the fact that we need to go and study for a test or the
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:10.240]   fact that tomorrow's gonna be a rough at work.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.360]   And again, all of these things are not wrong.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:15.320]   Many of them can be very, very valid.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:17.760]   I'm like a broken recording right now, I think.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:21.320]   But we have to survey our hearts and wonder, "Do I love others?
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:25.160]   Do I care about others better than me?"
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.640]   Answer that question as you're talking with people.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:33.920]   John 15, 13, "Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends."
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:35.920]   You will die for your friend.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:39.840]   So if you're a Christian that says, "Yes, I will die for my friend."
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:44.400]   And yet only Monday, Wednesday, and Friday's at 2 p.m.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:47.240]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.960]   There's no convenient time for this.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.080]   This is what we're called to.
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:52.560]   We are saved into this community.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:54.840]   So fourth and final point, practical application.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:56.360]   We're gonna run through this.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:52:01.140]   A, whatever the church offers, maximize the opportunities provided.
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:02.140]   Maximize the opportunities provided.
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:03.560]   There are plenty of things that are happening.
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.840]   If you don't know where to start, just go to something.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.120]   Just sign up and go.
[00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:10.080]   And when you're there, be all there.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.000]   Don't just say, "I did that."
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.760]   It's very easy to go to these things and just talk and want to check out the whole time.
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.600]   When I'm very tired, I want to do that.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.360]   I want to check out all the time.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:24.880]   Get away from me.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:28.120]   That kind of thing.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:33.800]   You can't have a deep, intimate relationship with every single person.
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   But the idea is, when you go to these functions, just with who got placed there.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.200]   In this smaller setting, someone that's sitting next to you, someone you're eating with, someone
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.200]   you're on a team with.
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.200]   I don't know.
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.520]   There's so many different events and things.
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:50.920]   I can't even define these things.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:54.040]   But maximize it.
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:59.680]   Go there and not say, "Oh, my purpose is to win with this team," or, "My purpose is to
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:02.360]   gain this thing," or, "To eat good food."
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:04.040]   Maybe eating, that kind of thing.
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:08.520]   But it's, "I'm going to maximize this little opportunity that's been given to me, and I'm
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:12.880]   going to be all there and talk to people."
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:19.640]   Make the use of these opportunities to deepen friendships, to get to know new people.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.520]   Please don't have the goal of, "I want to be best friends with everyone."
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:24.920]   Don't be that person.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:27.760]   But try to go deeper.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.720]   Have a desire to interact with, to fellowship with, and to love others in the way the Bible
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:33.920]   calls us to.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:39.880]   This church fellowship is so important, and we should be prioritizing Christian relationship.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:42.720]   Walking in the faith of brothers and sisters around us.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:47.720]   B, from the activities and functions, launch into continual relationship.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:54.360]   So once you get the surface level, like, "I got to meet people," try to launch deeper
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:58.560]   into that with continual relationship with them.
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:02.520]   So if you played a game with someone, or you were asked, there are different things where
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:06.260]   we say, "Hey, everybody break up into groups of four, pray for these things."
[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:11.600]   Don't just be like, "Amen," and then it's like, "So cool."
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:13.040]   Don't be like that.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:18.400]   But try to see, "Oh, how could we launch into continual relationship here?"
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:24.160]   Use that time to ask more questions, to talk more, to say, "I have a free lunch this Thursday."
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:29.320]   You should do these types of things, and get closer to each other in those manners.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:33.880]   C, don't hide behind your personality or life stage.
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:36.280]   I'm not a big fan of like Myers-Briggs.
[00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:40.320]   I think Enneagrams, everyone's into it, I kind of get annoyed by Enneagrams.
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:43.920]   But these things, like, whatever the case, I know, we're all different, I understand.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:44.920]   We're all very different.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:45.920]   That's what they're trying to say.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:46.920]   Great, you know?
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.480]   I knew that, but anyway.
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:54.040]   So there's that, and then it's like, don't hide behind it, though.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.360]   I'm an introvert, so I'll speak for myself.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:04.000]   As an introvert, we can normalize selfishness, and comfort, and unloving attitudes.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.120]   Why?
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:07.560]   Because I'm an introvert, I need to go recharge my battery, I'll be right back.
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:11.440]   You know, that kind of thing.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:14.800]   In the name of introversion, we can sin against God.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:21.760]   Extroverts, don't assume that your social ways is actually an expression of Christian
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:22.760]   love.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:25.000]   It might not be.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.960]   You might just be really friendly and actually very selfish.
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:38.800]   You know, just sucking out all the life of every introvert around you.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:42.840]   That is what you call leaking, I'm sorry about that one.
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:46.760]   Married couples, don't hide behind your spouses, parents behind your children.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:49.640]   College students, don't hide behind, "I'm a college student.
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:52.880]   Gotta go study."
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:56.240]   And then you're playing Smash.
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:59.520]   For those in the business of jobs, don't make it a regular thing to hide behind the need
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:00.520]   for rest.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:04.640]   Of course you're tired, I know, I know.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:07.600]   Life is so tiring, and you guys are so busy.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:13.920]   Sometimes I listen to your schedules, I'm like, "Man, I know it's hard, but don't hide
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:14.920]   behind those things."
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:19.840]   Letter D, be supportive, not critical of the function and activity.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:23.160]   Whatever is there, just again, it's kind of like the be all there.
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:26.400]   Don't be like, asking all the questions like, "Oh, this could have been done better.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.120]   Oh, why are you doing this?"
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.120]   That kind of thing.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:34.040]   Just be there and be happy to be there.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:35.880]   Just be engaged.
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:37.680]   Let's engage.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:41.560]   Don't be the person that's like, "Oh, I don't do that."
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:44.080]   Just be there.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.080]   Get yourself out there.
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.920]   Be vulnerable, even if you don't feel comfortable.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:49.160]   It's okay to do that.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:55.040]   Again, June and Dean, they put themselves out there last week, but they encouraged us,
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.440]   didn't they?
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:01.680]   Letter E, try to have one more extensive conversation at every function you're at.
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:05.840]   So if you really still don't know what to do, this is just last word of advice.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:09.840]   Everything that you're at, try to have one good, solid conversation.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:15.080]   Try to get to know someone a little bit better, pray for them, and different things like that.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.760]   It could be a new person.
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:20.560]   It could be someone that you have a very superficial, very friendly relationship with that you know
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:21.840]   needs to deepen.
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:25.160]   It could be any and everything that I just talked about.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:29.840]   So obviously, with all that said, again, you need to evaluate your own heart.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:33.240]   This doesn't mean you have to go out to every function and activity, and we can't be kind
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:36.880]   of pointing at each other and saying, "This is our standard to judge one another now."
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:40.880]   But we do have to look at our own hearts and say, "Man, do I love others?
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:41.880]   Is this real?
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:43.440]   Is this true for me?"
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:46.080]   Our church has rapidly grown.
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:49.660]   It's big, and it's overwhelming on Sundays.
[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:54.240]   But while we can't hope to get to know everybody, and that's okay.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:55.960]   It's okay if you don't know everybody.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:01.480]   But hopefully that you are not looking to say, "How do I fit in?" so much as, "How can
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:06.440]   I love others, and how can I edify this church, that person, this body, this group, or wherever
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:09.160]   it is that God has placed you?"
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:13.560]   We have been people who are changed by the gospel, by a God who laid down his own life
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:17.280]   for us, and so that's just the way we tick now.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:18.960]   That's how we operate.
