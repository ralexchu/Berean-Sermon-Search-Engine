[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   we do pray that we would lift up to you
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   not just simply words and thoughts,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   but truly our affection.

[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Father, we thank you for this opportunity to worship you.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   We thank you that we're able to gather so freely
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   to study your word, to learn more about you,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   to have fellowship with one another
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   as brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   We pray you be with us tonight.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   We thank you so much, again, for Christ.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   We thank you for your faithfulness
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   and for what you've done for us.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   We pray that you are with us tonight.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   We thank you so much, again, for Christ
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   and what Christ has done for us.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Die on the cross so that we may know you
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   and have eternal life, Lord.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   So we pray that our conversation
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   would be surrounded amongst you, Lord,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   amongst the gospel,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   that in all things we strive to honor and glorify you.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   So we thank you, Lord, we love you.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   We pray all this in your name.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Amen.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Okay, good evening again.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   I've got some important announcements for you guys.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   So one thing is that we are nearing the end
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   of our Bible study series.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   I had a great time learning about what a healthy church is,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   thinking through what a healthy member is
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   based on our tenfold commitments.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Next week, Pastor Peter is going to be coming back to teach
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   and also fielding some questions.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   So there are some pens, index cards at your table.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Please take a moment to think about things
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   related to, again, the commitments of the church,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   church ministry philosophy,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   and you can write down questions
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   for next week's Q&A and additional teaching.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   After you're done writing your questions,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   you can give them to your small group leaders,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   and then small group leaders,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   please make sure you turn it over to Justin
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   at the end of the night.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   So with that said, our next Bible study series
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   is going to be on the topic of hermeneutics,
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   and that'll start taking place on February 5th.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   It will be the first day of our series there.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   So please make sure that you sign up for that.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   We want to make sure that we have early sign-up
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   and registration so we can get everybody into a group.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Let's see.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   The next announcement that I have
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   is going to be for our BBA and WBBA sign-up.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   So this is a great opportunity just to connect with people,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   build some relationships, et cetera.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   So please make sure you sign up.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Again, there is the men's league and the women's league.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   You do have to be a member to participate in that,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   and the sign-ups are closing next week.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Another announcement is we have ping-pong tournament
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   for the end of the year on Tuesday evening, December 31st.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   It'll be in the main sanctuary.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   It's just $5 to participate.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   And this year, the tournament is going to be doubles only,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   and for the rest of you guys who don't play ping-pong,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   you are allowed to come, join in the festivities kind of thing,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   like spectate and watch, et cetera, cheer on.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   So please sign up for that.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Sign-ups will close December 22nd.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   And the final announcement is for all of our BAM members
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   and non-members, we have the retreat coming up in January 31st
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   through February 2nd, and it'll be at Pali Retreat.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   The theme is "Run to Win," and we have Pastor Ian Kwok
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   who will be coming to speak for us.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Please sign up early.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   There is going to be, unfortunately, a cap.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   There is a limited number of spaces.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   So for all of you BAM members,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   please go ahead and sign up for that ASAP.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Okay, please go ahead and go into your time of discussion,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   and we'll be back at 8 o'clock.

[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   (no audio)
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   Alright, let me pray for us and we'll get started.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the gathering of your children.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   We pray, Father God, that as we take some time to review over our Tenfold Covenant,
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   you would give us a greater understanding, and not just understanding,
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   but how we can apply these things to build a church that honors and glorifies you.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   We pray for your spirit's guidance, Lord God, over this time. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   Ah, ah, okay. Alright.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   As you guys know, some of the people who are somewhat newer to the church, or maybe have been here,
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   I've heard people saying, "Hey, how come we're not doing Bible study?"
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000]   Maybe you were asleep when we mentioned it in the beginning, right?
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   So, we took a short break because we're trying to bring people on the same page.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000]   As our church grows, we have people being added to the church,
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   and some of you guys who took membership more recently,
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000]   and then there's some people who've taken membership, you know, 10, 15, 20 years ago.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   And so, we want to make sure that what we're building in our church is very deliberate and purposeful.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   So, especially if you've come from another church, and you come back and, "How come we don't do this?"
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   And our church before, you know, that church that I went to used to do this, and how come we don't do that?
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   We're doing everything that we're doing. You may or may not understand it, but it's very purposeful, right?
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   Not that we're doing everything perfectly, but there's a reason behind what we're doing.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   So, these are the things that we've kind of learned through scripture study,
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   and realized that this is what the Bible outlines of what a healthy church should be trying to pursue.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   So, we took a temporary break in our study, or not expository, inductive Bible study, okay?
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   So that we can bring everybody on the same page.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   The next session of Bible study, before we, we're hoping to jump into the Old Testament,
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   but before we jump into the Old Testament, Pastor Mark is going to lead us in an extensive,
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   more extended course on how to study the Bible.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   So, he mentioned it earlier on, but what he's going to do is,
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   he's going to take texts from different genres of the Bible, right?
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   Like, we've been doing the epistles, but how do you do it from the poetic, from the narrative, from the prophetic?
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   And so, how do you do inductive study in that kind of context?
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000]   Because the way you would study the epistle is going to be very different than the way you would study the narrative.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   And, same thing, right now we're in the Gospel of Luke, which is taught to us in narrative.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   And so, we don't approach the narrative the same way we would approach an epistle.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   An epistle is a letter that says, "This is my main point, these are the three sub-points, and this is the conclusion."
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   That's how an epistle is written.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:39.000]   You can study it like a document, but when you're studying stories of events, you can't study it that way.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   Because there's a main point in each of the narrative, right?
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000]   And so, you can't study it like, "Here's the point, and here's the three sub-points, and here's the conclusion."
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000]   The narrative isn't presented that way.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   And so, same thing, when we go to the Old Testament, it's more given to us in a narrative.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   And the Old Testament narrative is very different than the New Testament narrative,
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   because New Testament narratives are usually within half a chapter or a chapter.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:12.000]   But, if you've read through Genesis, sometimes you have one story, and it goes up to four or five chapters.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000]   So, how do you do an inductive study when a narrative is that long?
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000]   Do you break it up? How do you approach each verse?
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   And so, those are the type of things that Pastor Mark is going to address for our next study.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:28.000]   And so, we're going to have specific text that he's going to give an example of how to study.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   So, hopefully, by the end of next session's study, that you'll be able to come out and say,
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000]   "Oh, that's how you study," and then before we jump back in.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000]   Okay? So, that's the reason why we're doing what we're doing.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   And then, another thing that we wanted to make clear, next session's Bible study is 10 weeks, not 13 weeks.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   And the reason why we're doing that, starting in February, beginning of February,
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000]   it's going to be ending at the end of April.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   And we're going to have a longer break in between.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000]   It doesn't mean that we're not going to be doing anything.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000]   During those three-month break, we're going to be doing Bible study a different way,
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000]   meaning that there are specific topics that need to be covered in the church,
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000]   whether it is marriage, or whether it is child rearing, or finance,
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.000]   whatever it is that we feel specifically that our church needs to be discipled in,
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000]   we're going to be approaching a different way.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   So, we're not going to be having Bible study this way,
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   but we're going to be giving various topics, asking people to sign up during that time.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000]   But because we've been having this inductive Bible study,
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   it's kind of hard for us to address specific things because it doesn't happen on Sunday.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000]   And if we can't address it during the weekday, we don't have a lot of avenues where we can do that.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   So, we're going to take the break time to address those specific issues.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   So, hopefully you understand why we're doing that.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000]   So, next session's Bible study is going to be a little bit shorter.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   From now on, it's going to be 10 weeks, 10 weeks, and then there's going to be longer breaks in between.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:56.000]   Alright, so today, I'm going to be just basically reviewing over,
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   but I want to just briefly go over our church history.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   And I know some of you guys who've been at our church for a long time, like this is all reviewed to you,
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   but even though you took membership recently,
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   I just, hopefully that you'll have a better understanding of how we got here,
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   so to better understand where we're headed.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:24.000]   First of all, our church was inaugurated, not established, but inaugurated on April 12, 1997.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   It just happens to be the day that my oldest son, Jeremiah, was born.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000]   So, I wasn't in the church yet. I was invited to participate in the inauguration.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000]   I couldn't come because Jeremy was born on that day.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   The church was actually established months before that, about two, three months prior to that.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   So, the only person that was there when that happened was Elder Joe.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.000]   So, I was the EM pastor of Korean Irvine Baptist Church.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   I left that church for about a year to serve at another church,
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000]   and then that church ended up splitting and falling apart.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:04.000]   I wasn't the problem. It just--that happened, and then I was the EM pastor of that church.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000]   I ended up coming back out, and then I was in between a church,
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.000]   and then I got a phone call from--I forget if it was Elder Joe or somebody else called and said,
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:19.000]   "You know, our church--the person who got permission to become an independent church,
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   he ended up leaving only after about two, three months."
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:28.000]   So, he got it incorporated, got the name, got permission, became independent, and then he left.
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   So, the only reason why I came is because I was in between church,
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   and they asked me to come basically to help out because they didn't have a leader there.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   I had no intention of planting a church.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   I was burnt out. I was kind of like debating back and forth if I was going to continue in ministry or not.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000]   Only reason why I came back is because I was attached to--at that time, they're all grown-ups now,
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:54.000]   but at that time, they were a bunch of kids, and I felt like they were going to fall apart,
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000]   and they're going to leave church, and so I came just to help out.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000]   That's how the church got started.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:07.000]   So, when I came back, I came to church in August of that year, 1997.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000]   And so, if you look at the original documents of the church, my name's not on it.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.000]   Some strange lady's name is on it that you wouldn't know, okay?
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:23.000]   And so, the only person that is here today that was there at that time is Elder Joe, okay?
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   And so, anything prior to that, you're going to have to ask him,
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000]   even though I was a EM pastor prior to that.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.000]   That's how the church got started, and then once we got to Irvine,
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   the senior pastor who came in as an interim didn't have a vision for us in the church.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000]   He wanted us to be more charismatic. He wanted us to be more Korean.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:47.000]   He asked me to teach Korean in the English service, and I said, "We can't do that.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.000]   We're here to spread the gospel. We already had non-Koreans in the church."
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   And so, eventually, we couldn't stay.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:00.000]   We were there for about two years. We left, and then Tustin Baptist heard that we were leaving,
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000]   and so they allowed us to use their facility for a couple of years.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   So, we were there for a couple of years, and then after two years of being there,
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   I think it was in 2001, we ended up leaving that, and then that's when we became independent.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000]   And all this time, I had no intention of planting a church.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   I just did it because we had a small group of young adults,
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.000]   and at that time, Elder Joe was probably, what, third year in college or something?
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   And he's an old guy at our church now, but at that time, he was just a college student.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   So, imagine how young the other people were, right?
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   They were, like, barely--like, high school, graduating high school, or first or second year in college,
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   and so that's the group that we had when we--
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000]   nobody in their right mind would plant the church with that group, right?
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:52.000]   So, 15 people means $15 a month, basically, to support the church, basically, right?
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000]   So, it wasn't a church plant.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   We just met together because I was concerned that the kids at that time were going to fall out if we didn't continue.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:08.000]   And so I had Jeremy, we had Zachary, and then eventually, obviously, faith came,
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000]   but that's how the church got started.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000]   We changed our name.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.000]   The original name of the church was Harvest Community Church because, again, I didn't name that church.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   It was a previous pastor who was here.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000]   He liked the name Harvest.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000]   I never liked it.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:26.000]   As soon as we got an opportunity to change it, I think we were about three years into the church
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   or four years into the church, we changed it to Berean Community Church.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.000]   So, that's the name I chose because it captures what we wanted to do with the church.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.000]   And so, up to this point, I had no intent of planting a church.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:46.000]   All I knew, and even our doctrinal statements, what were we going to be, how we're going to run the church,
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:52.000]   in my mind was not clear yet because, again, we didn't start out with a church saying,
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000]   "This is the vision that we have and we're going to have this kind of church.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000]   We're going to have membership."
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000]   All of that we kind of figured out as we went.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000]   But when we changed the church, the only thing that I knew for sure is we're going to stick to the Bible.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000]   We're going to study the Bible.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.000]   We're going to read the Bible, and we're going to apply what we read in the Bible.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000]   And then so that's why the name was chosen.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   And then every year since then, we're studying it, and if we find out, "Hey, maybe this is not the right way to do it.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   Maybe this is not the right way to run the church."
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:25.000]   And so, certain things about the church started getting changed and solidified because of that, right?
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:32.000]   So, we didn't have a clear vision, mission statement, membership process of what our vision is going to be five years.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000]   None of that was established at that time.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000]   Are we going to have elders?
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000]   Are we going to have deacons?
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000]   We were just kind of winging it, right?
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000]   And because our church was so young, nobody was against it.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   So, we just kind of went and did it, and then after, you know, now we're in almost our 28th years.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000]   Even to this day, our vision is still the same.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:56.000]   We're going to keep reading the Bible, and if we notice, even now, there are certain things that maybe,
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   "Hey, maybe that's not the right biblical way that the Bible teaches."
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   Then, you know, the only authority we have in this church is Scripture.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000]   Not tradition, not our denomination, not works.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000]   What works doesn't work, but what does the Bible say, okay?
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000]   So, that's our background.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   After we left, we were nomads for a while.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:20.000]   We were at Lakeside Middle School for a few years, and then we went to Harvard Community Park for, I think, a year.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000]   Deerfield Community Park, maybe for about nine months.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000]   Went to Turtle Rock Community Center for about a year.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.000]   And then from there, we thought we were going to be homeless because we couldn't find a place.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000]   We didn't have enough money.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:38.000]   So, we were actually even planning on having a picnic every Sunday because we didn't have a location.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:44.000]   And by that time, when we were at Turtle Rock, I think we were maybe about 60 people, 50 people.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000]   And then, we finally ended up at Northwood Community Park.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:52.000]   And then, at Northwood Community Park, we grew from about 50, 60 to maybe about 70, 80.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000]   And then, from there, we went to Up Middle School.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000]   And then, that one Sunday, we went from 80, 90 to about 110.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   And so, we added maybe about 20, 30 people on one Sunday, and we never dip under 100.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   So, we don't know why 20, 30 people came one Sunday and never left.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000]   [Laughter]
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000]   But literally, that's what happened.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.000]   Like, we grew 20, 30% one Sunday, and then with that, oh, they're just visiting, and then they just never left.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000]   Okay.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000]   And then, the church grew from there to about 100 to about 250.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.000]   We were there for about three years, and then we moved to Costa Mesa Airway Building.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000]   We moved there with about 250 people.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   I think we left with about 400.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:39.000]   And then, we came into this building with about 450, and now we're like somewhere around 1100 to 1200 people.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000]   So, that's kind of like our history.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   But the core values of our church has never changed, right?
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:54.000]   And so, in the process, the Fourfold Vision basically put together early on in the church.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:01.000]   This is when we were at Irvine Baptist, and then while we were at Tustin, we put the Fourfold Vision together.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:08.000]   And Fourfold Vision, you know, I'm not going to go through all of it, but basically, the first one is God-centeredness, right?
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:14.000]   Our church got established right when the seeker-friendly movement was just taking off.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:21.000]   So, every time we turn around, we say, you know, new song was 50, 100, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:27.000]   And so, every time I turned around, somebody was saying like, "Hey, stop being stubborn. You need to go get trained.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000]   You need to do this, and they're doing that, and why aren't you doing this?"
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:37.000]   And obviously, our church being so small, you know, like clearly you're doing something wrong, and they're doing something right.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.000]   But by this time, my commitment to the scriptures were already solidified.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.000]   So, I'm not going to run a church where we're going to be constantly changing
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.000]   because people are coming in and saying, "I want this type of a church. I want that type of a church," right?
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000]   Whatever we're going to do, we're going to do because the Bible teaches that.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000]   And the central thing that I see in the scripture is God is at the center, not man, right?
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:06.000]   Where the church is gathering for the purpose of God's glory, not our needs.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000]   Our needs are met when He's glorified.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000]   So, that's the central belief and the backbone of our church.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000]   And so, from that flows everything else.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:19.000]   So, if God's going to be glorified, the Word of God has to be centered, right?
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000]   Not surveying you, not what works, not what makes you happy, not what causes people to come,
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:29.000]   but if God's going to be glorified, He spelled out how He's going to be glorified in the Word of God.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:37.000]   So, that's why the second vision, and then third vision is in what avenue does this happen is in the church.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000]   And so, the building up of a healthy church, not just a church that meets your needs,
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:47.000]   but ultimately the church is where we carry out what the scripture tells us to glorify God.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.000]   And then, obviously, the fourth vision is to take this and multiply this, right?
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.000]   We can't have number four if you don't have number one.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000]   You cannot be a witness if you're not witnessing God at church, right?
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.000]   If God is not glorified in the church, He will not be glorified in the world.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000]   The church needs to be healthy in order for it to be multiplied in the world.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:15.000]   So, evangelism cannot be effective until the church is healthy, right?
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.000]   So, how do we carry that specifically? The tenfold vision came in as a result of that.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:26.000]   One, membership begins with believers, not just anybody who raises their hands, but genuine Christians.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:32.000]   So, that's why when you take membership, we want to make sure that your testimony is genuine.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:38.000]   Like, "I grew up in a church," or, "I wanted to be more moral."
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000]   Obviously, that's not what makes you a Christian, right?
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000]   So, membership is the first step. Confess that the Bible is inerrant.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:51.000]   Our authority over your life, my life, the church comes from the Bible, right?
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000]   You can say that all you want and not practice it.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000]   You can say the Bible is authoritative, and then the Bible is open, and then it says, "This is what it says."
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:06.000]   It's like, "Yeah, I know what it says," but then you don't practice it, then the Word of God is not authoritative.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000]   It's only authoritative if you actually apply it.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]   Saying it's authoritative doesn't make it authoritative.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000]   Authoritative means you apply it, right?
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:19.000]   And so, Christians who believe the Word of God has authority over your life,
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:24.000]   and it dictates what kind of mom you're going to be, what kind of father you're going to be,
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000]   what kind of son you're going to be, what kind of Christian you're going to be,
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000]   the Word of God dictates that, not me, not the world.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000]   Third, life of devotion to pray regularly.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000]   As important as the Word of God is, so is prayer.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:43.000]   Prayer is, again, Scripture tells us it's right up there, right?
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000]   Because spiritual work is not simply done by the mind.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000]   It's done spiritually, and so you have to engage spiritually.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000]   Commit to attending Sunday worship.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.000]   You cannot be a member of the church if you're not here participating in the most important part of the church,
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000]   which is Sunday worship.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000]   That's why when we're going through that, Pastor Mark went through that
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:06.000]   and emphasized to the best of your ability not to miss Sunday worship, right?
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.000]   And I know we live in a culture where graduations and soccer games
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000]   and everything is happening on Sunday morning,
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:18.000]   but we're asking you to the best of your ability to put that as the highest priority, right?
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000]   Even if you're traveling and you can't physically be here,
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000]   try to find a physical church to go to and attend, right?
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000]   To participate in the gathering of believers.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000]   Commit to attending and preparing for weekday Bible studies every week to the best of my,
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000]   again, to the best of my ability, right?
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000]   I know some of you guys came from eight, nine, ten hours of work today,
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.000]   and so the fact that you are here is a good first step, right?
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:50.000]   But we're asking you because, remember, we talked about Sunday philosophy is to get the Word into you.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000]   Weekday Bible study philosophy is to get you into the Bible, right?
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000]   So we don't want to just do the study and then spoon feed you.
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.000]   The philosophy of the Bible study is for you to get into the Word of God.
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:06.000]   So if your intake of the Word of God is just simply listening,
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000]   only a small portion is coming into you.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.000]   And so that's why we're asking you to participate in getting the Word of God into you,
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000]   into the Word of God, okay?
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000]   Six, I commit to attending PCC functions and the activities to the best of my ability.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000]   I know our church is bigger, right?
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000]   And you're not going to get to know 1,000 people in the church.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:30.000]   But because it's big and you say, "Well, what's the point," right?
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.000]   Well, in order to be a part of a community, you have to know the people who are around you,
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000]   even if it's not all 1,000 people, right?
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:45.000]   But if you make no effort to do that, then your idea of community is you just kind of put your name on the list and that's it, right?
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:50.000]   There might be people who are sitting right next to you right now who is in need of your prayer, encouragement,
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000]   or maybe a kick in the butt, right?
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:59.000]   But participating in community means that we are going to do our best to get to know as many people as possible, right?
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000]   And that's why we have functions.
[01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000]   We're asking you to the best of your ability to participate as much as you can.
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:09.000]   I commit to building up and strengthening the body of Christ at PCC by developing and using my spiritual.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:14.000]   We ask every member to find some capacity to serve, right?
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000]   Sometimes people think serving means leading, right?
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:23.000]   We take leadership very seriously, as you guys were reading the books that you're reading,
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000]   because leadership is not something that you just put in.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:31.000]   The Bible says not to lay hands hastily on especially new believers because they fall into the temptation of the devil.
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000]   Once pride gets in, you're ruined, right?
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000]   You're completely ruined.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:41.000]   No matter what you're doing, as soon as you have pride come in, you're no longer learning.
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000]   You're analyzing.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000]   You're critiquing.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000]   But you're not learning, right?
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:53.000]   And so we don't put leadership hastily because it not only ruins you, it ruins the church.
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000]   It ruins everybody beneath you, right?
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:02.000]   But we're asking everybody to find some way to serve, even if it's not leadership.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000]   Like, you know, we have parking duties.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000]   We have cleanup.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:11.000]   We have all kinds of stuff, you know, whether it's praise team or maybe someday you'll be leading small group,
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:19.000]   whatever it is, to find some way, if you're a member of the church, to function in some way to serve the church.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000]   And then I commit to tithing and giving financially in accordance with Christ's lordship over my life.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:28.000]   And I talked about that before, why finance is so emphasized in the Scripture,
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000]   because it says wherever your money is, there your heart is.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000]   If you're stingy with your money, you end up being stingy with your heart.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.000]   And so if you're generous with your money, you're generous with your heart, right?
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000]   And so that's why that's number nine.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.000]   I commit to the best of my ability to advance the kingdom of God through sharing the gospel locally and globally.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:56.000]   So locally and globally, we want to be a witness here, but we also know that we have more resources than most other countries, right?
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:01.000]   Especially as our church grows, we have more and more opportunities because we have more resources together.
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000]   And so we want to use that not only here, but also abroad, okay?
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:11.000]   And then finally, Pastor Mark covered, I desire to be kept accountable by leadership and other members of BCC
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:15.000]   and to keep others accountable above covenants and teachings of Scripture.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000]   And this is something that is very important.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:24.000]   Accountability in the church is very important, but at what point does it become judging, right?
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000]   Will you figure that out?
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:32.000]   Because that line is very hard for us to determine, right?
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:42.000]   The line that I use when I feel like, am I criticizing out of love, right?
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000]   And I'm pointing things out in your life out of love.
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000]   I genuinely care for your well-being, right?
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:55.000]   Or am I just peeved at people because they're not behaving a certain way, right?
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000]   And so if I find that my heart is not in the right place, then I need to pray more.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000]   Or maybe I'm not the best person to talk to that person, right?
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:08.000]   If I'm irritated, I got to speak the truth, but you don't have love.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:14.000]   Or sometimes if you say, you know, I have love, but because you have love, somehow that squashes the truth.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000]   That's never the case.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000]   God never will compromise truth and love.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.000]   It would be together.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000]   But sometimes you can do truth, very little love.
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.000]   And it does more damage than good when you do that, right?
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.000]   And sometimes you do love, but you're not actually love.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:35.000]   It's more -- it serves you because you don't want that person to think bad of you, right?
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:41.000]   So true love is always expressed in love, right?
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000]   Both things always need to be present.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000]   So even if they don't recognize it, at least you need to do your best.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000]   First and foremost, you prayed for them, right?
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000]   And you desire what's best for them, right?
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.000]   So that's also important.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.000]   Part of being a community, there is accountability.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:03.000]   We don't like just -- you go off and do something, and if somebody you really love is starting to do drugs,
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:08.000]   you're not going to look at that and say, I don't want to judge them because I love them.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000]   That's not love.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:16.000]   If you really love them, you do everything in your power to try to talk to them, right?
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:22.000]   But it's because you love them that you're going to talk to them, not simply because you don't like it.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:28.000]   All right, so all ten of these covenants are, I would say, the backbone of the church.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000]   This is not unique to Berean Community Church.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.000]   If you study the scripture, this is what's taught for every Christian.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.000]   The only difference is we've decided to jot it down, and we're trying to practice it
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.000]   and keep each other accountable to make sure that this is actually what we're pursuing.
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.000]   So every year, at the end of the year, we try to look at where we are at the church,
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:51.000]   and we evaluate what is our weakness, what is something that we need to be strengthened,
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:55.000]   and then we make that a goal, and we try to pursue that, at least go that direction.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:02.000]   So if you've noticed, the last five years, what was our goal?
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:10.000]   Unless you joined us brand new, you should know, hopefully,
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:17.000]   prayer has been our primary focus because every year we evaluate this is an area that we need to grow in.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.000]   I think we've made some progress. We're not there yet.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.000]   And so next year's theme is going to be the same, be devoted to prayer.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:31.000]   This time it's going to work, all right?
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:36.000]   Before it was just, "Ah, let's pray," but no, we're going to be devoted to prayer this time, okay?
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000]   All right? And so, you know, every year we evaluate this is what we want to do.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000]   We want to be intentional about where we're headed.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:47.000]   Even if we're only taking a few steps, those few steps are leading us to the right direction.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.000]   So we're going to keep emphasizing what we feel like is our weakness,
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000]   and I think this is still our weakness, okay?
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:59.000]   All right, so this was an overview of what happened.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:07.000]   The fourfold question--who put that there?
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000]   Nice, okay.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:15.000]   How has the review of the Tenfold Covenant helped you to better understand the beliefs and practices of BCC?
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:21.000]   Self-explanatory, why do you think the commitments to these covenants from every member is important to the health of the church,
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000]   not just the leadership, not just the people who've been here for a while, but every member of the church?
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.000]   Which one of the Tenfold Covenants do you have the hardest time applying, and why?
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000]   And then the fourth question is--Pastor Mark already mentioned it,
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.000]   but the fourth question is, next week we have one more session,
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000]   and you're going to be reading Chapter 13 of the book,
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:46.000]   and then during our time I'm going to be taking Q&A, right?
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.000]   So there might be some things that you may have discussed and still kind of like--
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.000]   maybe the small group leaders are thinking it may be better if I addressed it
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:59.000]   or clarified it, and so what I'm asking is, after today's discussion,
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.000]   I will not be taking 450 questions, right?
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.000]   And so I'm asking that the priority is going to be,
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:13.000]   if you need some sort of clarification on why we are doing certain things,
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:18.000]   or maybe something's required more, maybe something was said and I don't fully understand.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:25.000]   So if it's related to the church, we ask that--put it on a 2x5, 5x5, whatever.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000]   Did everybody get a card?
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000]   Did everybody get a card?
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000]   Okay.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000]   There's no way I'm going to go through everybody's card,
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:39.000]   so I'm going to ask that you would jot it down within the table.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.000]   Somebody jot down that these are the questions that we have.
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:47.000]   So if you put two or three that kind of like--it would be helpful if you address this issue
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:54.000]   that I'm going to try to address it, and I would need it today from you guys.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000]   I'm not saying that I won't.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:04.000]   If there's time and you ask something else that's not maybe directly related to what we studied,
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000]   I may be able to get to it.
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000]   I'm assuming that I probably won't.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:12.000]   But if you ask questions of, you know, how do you get, you know, like dating questions
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:22.000]   or something a lot more personal, right, how do you do this?
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:27.000]   I'm not saying that I won't answer these questions, but probably we're not going to get time to do it.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.000]   So try to limit the questions that's pertaining to the church.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:37.000]   Like, help me to better understand why our church does this or why our church doesn't do this, okay?
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.000]   And according to the tenfold vision, but it doesn't have to be limited to the tenfold vision.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.000]   Anything in the church you feel like this will help me to understand what's going on in church,
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.000]   then I'll try to address that next Sunday--next Wednesday, okay?
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000]   All right.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.000]   Let me pray for us, and then shuttle is shut down from 9:30 to 10.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000]   We'll run from 9:30 to 10.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000]   All right.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.000]   Let me pray for us.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:10.000]   Father, we thank you for this evening and the time that we've had to study the tenfold covenant
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000]   and why these things are important to us,
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:17.000]   and we pray that even our last session of discussion would lead us, Lord God,
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:22.000]   into a greater understanding so that the church may be built in a way that honors and glorifies you.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:29.000]   I pray that you would bless the discussion and that things that we've learned would be applied in such a way,
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:34.000]   Father God, that we would be a greater light according to the purpose and what you've given us in your word.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000]   We thank you, Father, in Jesus' name we pray.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000]   Amen.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.000]   Okay, so at the end of it, if somebody can write down whatever discussion questions
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:49.000]   or the questions that you have, and please write it large so I can read it, right?
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000]   If you're a doctor, have somebody else write it for you, okay?
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:14.000]   I cannot read your writing.
