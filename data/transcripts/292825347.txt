[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   Romans 15, verse 30 to 33.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.040]   Romans chapter 15, 30 to 33.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.120]   I know it's been read, but we want you to know which text that we're in.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.520]   So we're reading it again in Romans chapter 15, 30 to 33.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.760]   Now I urge you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.800]   together with me in prayer to God for me, that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.960]   in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints, so that
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.960]   I may come to you in joy by the will of God and find refreshing rest in your company.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.960]   Now the God of peace be with you all.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.960]   Amen.
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.960]   Let's pray.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.280]   Heavenly Father, you are a gracious and loving God.
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.000]   We thank you, Father, for loving us, guiding us, and giving us the privilege to be able
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.120]   to come together corporately to worship you.
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.320]   We pray that your word would go forth and have its effect on our hearts.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.840]   Sanctify us, renew us, strengthen us, Lord God, that your word would develop, strengthen,
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.960]   rebuke, encourage, and train us, Lord God, for a life of godliness for your namesake.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.840]   So bless us this morning, Jesus, and we pray.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.160]   Amen.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:25.040]   So as you guys know, we're like wrapping up chapter 15 and 16, and I don't know exactly
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.320]   how many more sermons are left in 15 and 16, but it's been, again, for me, you know, I'm
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.120]   kind of hesitant to leave Romans.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.220]   We've been on it for so long, and it's been a, personally, it's been a blessing for me
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.440]   to be able to go back and review and prepare sermons, and as we're looking at chapter 15,
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.800]   he is wrapping up his presentation of this is the reason why he wrote the letter.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.600]   He's in the context of doing mission and spreading the gospel that he says in the previous verse
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.080]   that he's kind of run out of places to go, and now he's trying to stretch his ministry
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.360]   out towards Spain, and so his whole intention is to come stop by Rome.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.800]   His goal is not to be in Rome, but to stop by Rome to encourage them, to get some support,
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.040]   and to move out to Spain.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.980]   Apostle Paul was a man who was absolutely committed, obsessed with the gospel ministry,
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.820]   and we talked about last week that this was not unique to Apostle Paul.
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.400]   We saw that in the early church.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.680]   All the apostles went all different places doing the exact same thing, that they covered
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.840]   what we would consider about the size of the United States in about 10 to 15 years.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.820]   A few men who were just running, some of them running for their lives, and that's how the
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.200]   gospel spread in the first 15 years.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.240]   You know, if you've ever been out to short-term missions, you know what it feels like, and
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.240]   I think, you know, I've been taking short-term trips with our church and even previous to
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.560]   that so many times, and I really enjoy that time.
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.960]   Physically, it's draining, but during that period, you know, you have a small group of
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.520]   people who are very focused on doing God's work.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.760]   People raise money, and we prepare for two months or three months, and while we're there,
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.440]   you know, most of the time, we're not living in comfortable quarters.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.720]   We might have decent food.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.720]   We may not.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.600]   A lot of times, we're physically drained at the end of the day, and usually, I get much
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.960]   better sleep out in the mission field than I do here, because by the end of the day,
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.320]   I'm so physically exhausted, I hit the bed, and I just conk out, you know, so I don't
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.720]   have a problem sleeping as much as when I am here.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.520]   But anybody who's been out to short-term missions will share with you, you know, just
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.760]   the joy that they experience in the midst of fatigue and working and sacrificing, because
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.820]   there's a clear sense of purpose.
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.180]   You wake up in the morning, you know exactly why you're there.
[00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.680]   You eat breakfast, you meet up with people, you do physical labor, and everything that
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.680]   we do, there's a clear purpose, clear reason, and it is obviously to spread the gospel.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.400]   And we want to continue that when we come back home.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.040]   Like, why can't we live with this purpose?
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.600]   And that's almost always the application that all the team members have when they come back
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   from these trips.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.600]   Like, okay, I was affected.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   This was great.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.600]   I don't need to live this way.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.920]   But the challenge is when we come home, for whatever the reason, we turn that off.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.080]   And so we kind of have experiences.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.280]   It was great when we went out.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.240]   And so that's why so many people have been out to short-term, want to continue to go
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.880]   out, because they want to experience that experience of being just single-minded in
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.880]   everything that we're doing.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.140]   See, God did not intend that to be just for the apostles or just a few missionaries who
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.760]   pack up their bags and go wherever it is that they go.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.960]   God called us to live single-mindedly for the gospel, whether you are here or you're
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.520]   overseas, whether you are short-term missions or you're here raising children.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.440]   Paul says in 1 Corinthians 9, 22, 27, he sums up his ministry this way, "To the weak I
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.720]   became weak that I might win the weak.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.880]   I become all things to all men so that I may by all means save some.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.700]   I do all things for the sake of the gospel."
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.100]   That pretty much sums up his whole life.
[00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.740]   Everything that he does, he does for the sake of the gospel.
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.080]   Not just two weeks in the summer, not just over the weekend, not just when the church
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.540]   has a program or certain things are going on, but he said everything he does, he does
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.040]   for the sake of the gospel.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.580]   He goes on and says, "So that I may become a fellow particular, do you not know that
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.540]   those who run in a race all run, but only one receives a prize.
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.520]   Run in such a way that you may win."
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.700]   There's a distinction between a Christian who is frustrated and a Christian who's bearing
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.700]   fruit.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.740]   It's like everybody runs, right?
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.580]   If you are a believer, you are running, you are part of the race, but Paul says God's
[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.580]   calling for us is not to simply say, "You know what?
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.340]   I'm in the race," but he says, "Run in such a way to win."
[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.100]   Are we committed to this?
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.900]   Do we do all things for the sake of the gospel or is the gospel just something that's things
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:13.680]   that we do when we're at church or at Bible study or in small group or when we have projects?
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.620]   Can we say that when we look at our lives, that meeting Christ changed everything about
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.260]   us?
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.940]   Everyone who competes in the games, exercises self-control and all things, they then do
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.620]   it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.840]   Christians and non-Christians, all of us, we have things that are on our mind and we
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.820]   run toward.
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.420]   Imagine, even many of you in here, how hard you are working to get the promotion.
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.220]   If you're a student, you're working very hard because you have projects coming up, you want
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.740]   to graduate, you want to get a job.
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.380]   There's certain things that we're doing in our families.
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.940]   We have goals and we want to win, we want to get better, we want to get ahead, but he
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:02.380]   said that the world does all of that for perishable wreath.
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.060]   That you may get the promotion, your business may do well, you may have a better retirement,
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.440]   but the end goal of all of that is perishable.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:18.620]   That whether you win or lose, the end product of it is judgment.
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.960]   But Paul says, but we do it for imperishable.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.380]   We are consumed, we are focused, we are dedicated for things that cannot perish, which ultimately
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.380]   is the gospel.
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.860]   Therefore, Paul says, I run in such a way as not without aim, I box in such a way as
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.860]   not beating the air, but I discipline my body and make it my slave so that after I have
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.220]   preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.860]   That pretty much sums up Paul's life.
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.780]   It sums up the apostles' life, it sums up the early church life.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.780]   It sums up the life of many Christians even today.
[00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:57.700]   But they met Christ and it didn't just change a tenth of their finances.
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:05.140]   Tithe was always meant to be an act of dedication of everything that we have.
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.420]   But the problem and the challenge that we have is in the way that we give tithe, that
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:16.420]   we give a tenth and so therefore the 90% is mine to do whatever I want.
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.460]   We've given our Sundays, so Monday through Saturday is mine.
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:25.300]   We've dedicated this much, so all of this is for me to have.
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.860]   Paul was consumed, he was obsessed with the gospel.
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:34.460]   And it would only make sense for somebody who confesses Christ as Lord and Savior that
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.020]   their life would look something like this.
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:44.220]   Paul, in summarizing that this is the purpose of why he wrote the letter, he concludes everything
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.980]   that he's been saying by saying, after you've heard all of this and the reason why I'm
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:52.820]   coming, and I'm asking you, I'm urging you to pray.
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:58.180]   Above all that I have said, before you pack up your bags, before you get challenged and
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:04.260]   you go out on the street, before you organize your finances and give it to anybody, before
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:09.020]   you do anything, he says, I urge you to be committed to prayer.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.900]   The word urge in the ESV is appeal.
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:18.900]   Or in New King James it says to beseech, or the King James Version has the most clearest.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:26.780]   And it gives the real meaning behind this, where Paul says, I beg you, I beg you to pray,
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.580]   to be devoted to prayer.
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.700]   Not just to pray nonchalantly, not just to sprinkle prayer on all the things that we
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.700]   have planned.
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.980]   And we have a tendency to kind of make our plans that God, would you help me to do this?
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.140]   He says, no, to be devoted to prayer.
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:48.060]   Romans 12, 12, rejoice in hope, persevering in tribulation, and be devoted to prayer.
[00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.660]   To be devoted to prayer.
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.700]   That's the difference between an effective prayer and an ineffective prayer.
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:10:01.260]   A prayer that is offered up to God nonchalantly is usually very ineffective.
[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.860]   And I share this many times, when you're raising children, you know, especially when they're
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:10.340]   young, you know when they need you and you know when they're just crying out for attention.
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.180]   There's a difference, you know, and I think that's the difference between a veteran parent
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.820]   and a newbie parent, right?
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.700]   So when you have your first kid, every time they cry, you're like freaking out.
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.180]   You know, two in the morning, four in the morning, you hear a little bit of cry, they
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.180]   need me.
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.860]   What if they're suffocating and you run in and you're so tired by the time you get to
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.940]   your third kid, it's like, eh, they don't need me.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.940]   They're not hungry.
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.060]   I fed them, they weren't sick.
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.100]   When I put them down, they don't need me.
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.300]   So there are certain things that they don't really need my attention.
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.220]   So when they're younger, you jump at everything.
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:45.240]   But as they get older, you know there are certain kinds of cries where you need to jump
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.240]   and get to.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.980]   And there are certain kinds of cries, they're just being kids.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:57.220]   In the way that we pray, are we simply getting God's attention or are we devoted to this?
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:01.180]   In Colossians 4, 2, it says, "Devote yourselves to prayer."
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:07.780]   In 1 Thessalonians 5, 17, "Pray without ceasing."
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:14.020]   All throughout Scripture, it describes the temple of God as a place of prayer.
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:18.180]   He didn't say it's a place of gathering, he didn't say it's a place of community, he didn't
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.220]   say it's a place of organization.
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:27.060]   And all of these things are true, but primarily it says it is a place of prayer.
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:32.780]   2 Chronicles 7, 14, when the temple of God was being dedicated after Solomon made it,
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:39.340]   the prayer they offered up to God was, "If my people humble themselves and pray."
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:46.980]   It was meant to be a place for people to come and meet with God, first and foremost.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.820]   Jesus himself, when he was angry with the way that the temple was being used, he says
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:12:02.220]   that the zeal for the house of God would consume him, and he called the temple a place of prayer.
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.180]   How much of our frustration is with community?
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:10.660]   How much of our frustration is about peripheral things and not focused on what is central,
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.660]   about meeting God?
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:17.700]   Ephesians 6, 18-19, "With all prayer, petition, pray all the times in the Spirit, and with
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:23.060]   this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints."
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:28.100]   You notice how over and over again he mentions all prayer, all times, all perseverance, for
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.340]   all the saints.
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:35.820]   He says this at the end of the spiritual battle, "Put on the full armor of God so that we
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.380]   can engage the spiritual battle."
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:42.860]   And at the end, conclusion, he says, "Pray, pray, pray, pray, pray."
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:47.340]   That's the primary thing that God calls us to do in the church, to be a place of prayer,
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:51.580]   to meet with God.
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:57.820]   Before we are devoted to missions, before we are concerned about community, before we
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:04.660]   are concerned about our family, before we are consumed over the well-being of our children,
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:10.540]   he said first and foremost to pray.
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.180]   Not only does he say to pray, he says to strive together.
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:19.500]   The word for striving together is "sun agonizomai."
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:24.380]   You can already hear the English word behind that, to agonize, to wrestle, to struggle.
[00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.220]   And the word "sun" means to be together.
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.900]   He says in our prayer, we are to agonize together.
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:37.260]   See, where you and I are, typically when we think of prayer, prayer is offered up kind
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.260]   of as a side note.
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.940]   Like, we've already made our plans, we've already figured out how to do church, we've
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.020]   already figured out what to do in discipleship, we've already figured out how people should
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.740]   behave and not behave, what I like and don't like.
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.780]   And then after we have done all the work, we come before God, "Lord, would you bless
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.780]   this?"
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:14:00.140]   He said first and foremost, the work is the prayer, to struggle.
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.820]   That's why Paul says in Colossians 2, "I want you to know how great a struggle I have
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:05.820]   on your behalf."
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:06.820]   To pray.
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:11.500]   He's been praying for the Colossians even before he ever met these people.
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.780]   He said he struggled in prayer.
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:19.140]   You know, one of the crucial points in Israel's history where Jacob wrestles with God and
[00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:24.140]   he changes his name to Israel, calls him the man who wrestles with God.
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:32.100]   So God made the promise to Abraham, but where it actually begins to form is under Jacob.
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:38.420]   But that beginning point in Genesis chapter 22, where he, this tricky man who basically
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:44.980]   tricked his older brother out of his birthright, now he sees God and he says, "I cannot let
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.940]   you go until you bless me."
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:53.180]   And so the blessing upon Jacob and his family came because Jacob wrestled with God and he
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.180]   wouldn't let him go.
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.980]   He agonized.
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:00.980]   And for the rest of his life, as a sign of his wrestling, God basically allows him to
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.980]   limp.
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.700]   And that limp was a sign of his devotion to God.
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:10.140]   But where we see the greatest wrestling before God is Jesus himself.
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:15.260]   In Luke chapter 22, verse 44, as he is wrestling in the garden of Gethsemane, before he goes
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:23.180]   to the cross, he says, "And being in agony, he was praying fervently and his sweat became
[00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:27.580]   like drops of blood falling down upon the ground."
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:31.940]   In the NASB, it says it was like a blood, like drops of blood.
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:37.900]   In some of your translations, it just says his sweat turned to blood.
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.500]   In the journal of dermatology, there's actually a name for this condition.
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.500]   Hematohedrosis.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:48.500]   So those of you guys in the medical field, even if I butchered it, just be gracious.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.780]   Hematohedrosis.
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:58.740]   If you're not in the medical field, that's how it's pronounced.
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:06.420]   He says this is a condition that comes when a human being over exerts themselves.
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:15.820]   He says the cause of hematohedrosis is excessive exertion, psychogenic, and other conditions
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:16.960]   that they haven't figured out.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:23.620]   But there's an actual condition when someone has exerted themselves to the point of exhaustion,
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.940]   and he says these things have happened.
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.480]   And this is, again, this is coming from a medical journal.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:32.100]   He says that Christ, when at the Garden of Gethsemane, was wrestling before God in prayer,
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.740]   and his sweat actually turned into blood.
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.180]   And you can imagine, humanly speaking, for three years, as soon as people thought that
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.820]   he might be the Messiah, they would not leave him alone.
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:43.820]   Understandably.
[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.780]   I mean, he starts with a small crowd, but by the time his fame begins to spread, people
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.860]   would travel for days just to see him.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:56.980]   And then once he begins to speak, the group is divided in two.
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:01.000]   One group who couldn't get enough of him, and they were tearing down other people's
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.020]   roofs to get to him, and he would disappear because he's tired, break away even from his
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.060]   disciples and wear easy.
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:15.700]   And thousands of them would cross seas and hills and travel long distances just to get
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.600]   to him, and they would not leave him alone.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.820]   And then you had the other group of people, once they figured out that Jesus was not for
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:24.940]   them, was constantly planning to kill him.
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:29.220]   Imagine living under that pressure for three years.
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:33.700]   You know, this week is Welcome Week, and so I know a lot of you collegians came back into
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:38.340]   town and there's a lot of events of reaching out, and it's been a busy week for the college
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.060]   ministry, in particular, Pastor Nate.
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:47.100]   You know, he got baptized into college ministry this week, and so we knew that the difficult
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:52.260]   schedule was coming up, but I felt tired for him yesterday.
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:57.500]   You know, and on top of that, we had our annual, like all-day leaders meeting right in the
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.660]   middle of this, and then he had to stick around.
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:03.940]   We went home and crashed, and then he had to stick around, you know.
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:12.580]   But can you imagine that as tiring as that may be, that Jesus was probably that ten times,
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.340]   three years, nonstop.
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:22.100]   So by the time he gets to Gethsemane, he is utterly exhausted.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.580]   Even when the disciples, when some of them came, they say, "I'm going to follow you,"
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.460]   and that's exactly what it says.
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:32.060]   You know, "Fox have holes, birds of the air has net, but Son of Man has nowhere to rest
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.940]   his head."
[00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:37.180]   That's how exhausted he was.
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.860]   But his exhaustion wasn't simply physical.
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:46.020]   He was agonizing before God because he knew what was coming the next day.
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:52.080]   I mean, you know how uncomfortable it is when you go somewhere where you're just not familiar?
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.180]   You know what that feels like, right?
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:19:01.100]   Whether it's some other place or some other place's house, or maybe the food's unfamiliar,
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:06.820]   or you know, it's just tiring because you're not at home, right?
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:13.420]   Christ, according to Scripture, could not dwell among sinners.
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:18.180]   That's what the whole book of Leviticus is about, to describe a holy God who cannot dwell
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.380]   with sinners and sinners who cannot approach him.
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:26.540]   So imagine this God who created the universe, everything's made for him, by him, and for
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.780]   him, and all things sustained through him.
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:36.180]   The fact that he was even just walking on earth must have been completely exhausting.
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:41.500]   Think about you parents who have small children, right?
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.820]   Does a three-year-old ever stop and say, "Oh, you must be tired.
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.340]   I'm going to behave today."
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:46.340]   Does that ever happen?
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.620]   Has that ever happened to you?
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.100]   Write some books if that ever happened.
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:56.740]   Like, you know, a bunch of three, two, you know, four-year-olds, and it's like, "I was
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.780]   just too loud yesterday, you know?
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:03.380]   I'm just, you know, I want to—today's for you, Mommy, Daddy."
[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.540]   Does that ever happen?
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.540]   No.
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.540]   It's like, it's just them, you know?
[00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:12.580]   It's about them, 24/7, three in the morning.
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:17.580]   You could have been sick for three days and vomiting.
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.780]   They're hungry.
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.140]   You better get up.
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:28.220]   Imagine Jesus walking on earth among sinners, where the whole purpose in life is to glorify
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.180]   themselves, you know?
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.340]   And he walked among us.
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.140]   It's just the fact that he was here.
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:40.420]   Imagine how tired he was just to be here.
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:45.220]   But that wasn't the real fatigue.
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:51.060]   He knew that the cross was coming, and at the cross, that all the selfishness, all the
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:58.740]   sins, past, present, and future, that they've tried so hard to hide, was going to be laid
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:04.380]   upon him, and he was going to have to absorb all of that upon himself.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.980]   And the only person that was aware of that, it was the Trinity.
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.300]   Everybody else was, "What's going on?
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.300]   When is the kingdom coming?
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.300]   Who's going to sit at the left?
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.580]   Who's going to sit at the right?"
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:22.900]   Jesus knew, and that's why he sat before his Father, agonizing, physically fatigued, and
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:31.300]   was wrestling before his Father, because he knew what was at stake.
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:37.740]   Part of the reason why you and I do not agonize is because we are not often aware of the spiritual
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.460]   battle that you and I are in.
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:47.860]   We do not agonize often because we don't recognize what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.900]   And so prayer becomes a duty.
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.220]   Prayers become something that we must do.
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:22:01.180]   But consider what prayer ultimately is.
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:05.460]   How much of our focus in our walk with God is about building community?
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:11.340]   I want to have good friends when we go to church.
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.740]   I want people that are like me.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:18.380]   I want to be able to run together, do things together, and do missions together, and raise
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.820]   our children together.
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:24.660]   And so much of our frustration comes from when the community that we want isn't functioning
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.800]   the way I want.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.760]   So much of our frustration, so much of our relational problems, are because we've paid
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.860]   attention too much to peripheral things and not enough in what's at the core.
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:46.980]   Let me ask you, how many of you didn't have friends before you became a Christian?
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.940]   Maybe some of you, all right?
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.460]   Most of you had friends before you became a Christian.
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:55.020]   Maybe some of you had more than others.
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:59.300]   How many of you guys didn't have a job before you became a Christian?
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:03.660]   How many of you didn't have family before you became a Christian?
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.580]   How many of you didn't have money before you became a Christian?
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:12.580]   Like didn't you belong to a club, key club, baseball club, basketball club, I don't know
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.580]   what club?
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.540]   Didn't you belong to some kind of community?
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:20.820]   Didn't you have goals and purpose before you became a Christian?
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.940]   Get a job, go to school, right?
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.460]   Make money.
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:33.460]   Why has all of that stuff come back in and have become the central things that we're
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:38.340]   looking for when the only thing that you were missing before you became a Christian was
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.840]   God?
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:44.640]   It wasn't money, it wasn't community, it wasn't friendship, it wasn't family.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.100]   You had all of that before you met Christ.
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:54.200]   What was missing was your relationship with Christ.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:24:01.700]   So the primary pursuit of every Christian ought to be pursuit of Christ because that's
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:09.980]   what was restored when Christ was crucified.
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:16.060]   Prayer is not the preparation for battle, it is the battle itself.
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:21.460]   It's coming before God and acknowledging that I don't have the authority or the power.
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:27.220]   At the core of prayer is acknowledging that He is Lord and not me.
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:33.300]   And isn't that what we were saved from?
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:37.340]   The difference between a Christian and a non-Christian isn't simply what he confesses.
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:41.380]   Like, "Oh, I believe that Jesus died on the cross."
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:46.220]   Oh, Christian, and I don't know if I believe that, I don't know if there's a God, so non-Christian.
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.660]   Well the Bible goes a bit further than that.
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:53.220]   The book of James says you can confess all of that and still have demonic faith.
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.660]   That's not real faith.
[00:24:54.660 --> 00:25:01.660]   The difference between a true believer and an unbeliever is the one who understands and
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:06.140]   acknowledges God as Lord.
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:10.500]   In 1 Peter 4, 7 it says, "At the end of all things is near, therefore be of sound judgment
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.260]   and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer."
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.100]   He doesn't say pray so that you can be sober.
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.340]   He says be sober so that you can pray.
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:24.220]   So the power is in prayer, not in your soberness.
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.260]   It's for the purpose of prayer.
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:29.060]   He says it again in 1 Peter 3, 7, "You husbands, in the same way, live with your wives in an
[00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:34.460]   understanding way as with someone weaker, since she is a woman, and show her honor as
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.940]   a fellow heir of the grace of life so that your prayers would not be hindered."
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:45.300]   He says be gracious, be loving, be a good husband so that you can pray, so that your
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:49.580]   prayers would not be hindered.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:54.220]   The reason why, one of the reasons why we are ineffective in our prayers is because
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:59.060]   our life is inconsistent with the way that we pray.
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:05.260]   If we don't acknowledge God as Lord, you can't come in prayer and say, "Lord, let your will
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.580]   be done on earth as it is in heaven."
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.220]   Prayer is the battle.
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:15.660]   It battles against our desire to be independent of God.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:22.580]   Prayer is when we wrestle before God to establish Him as Lord and not us, where He becomes central,
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.620]   where He is the source of power, not me.
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:29.500]   We don't do all these things, make all these plans, and then God sprinkles and says, "Lord,
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.500]   would you help me to do these?
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:35.700]   Help me to raise my children, help me to have this kind of church, and help me to do this
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:36.700]   and that."
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:37.700]   He says no.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:42.660]   He says we do all of these things so that we can pray, so that we can be effective in
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.660]   our prayer.
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:54.220]   Let me ask you, how fervently and devoted would you be to prayer if you knew, if you
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:27:03.780]   knew that God was waiting for you to make up your mind to pray to save your loved ones?
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:11.860]   And I know most of you know somebody that you are praying that they would come to Christ.
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.740]   And you ask for prayer.
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:17.580]   Every time we ask, we have prayer meetings that you may bring that up and pray.
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:22.740]   But you yourself are not devoted to praying for that.
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.460]   You kind of prayed on the peripheral.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.580]   You kind of pray in prayer meetings maybe if somebody asks you.
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:31.180]   But you have not committed yourself to pray that that is the source.
[00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:35.820]   So you sought counsel, you've asked other people, you've asked other pastors and other
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:41.980]   leaders to get involved, but you have not engaged God.
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:47.220]   How many of you would be devoted to prayer if you knew for a fact God says you do not
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:54.740]   have because you did not ask?
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.360]   But the truth is that's exactly what he says.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:02.300]   In James chapter 4, 2-3, "You lust and do not have, so you commit murder.
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.260]   You are envious and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel.
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:09.960]   You do not have because you do not ask.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.780]   You ask and do not receive because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.580]   it on your pleasures."
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:22.200]   He says you do not have because you have not devoted yourself to pray.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:28.220]   He says even in prayer, he says in verse 30, "I urge you by our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.420]   By our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:35.060]   It may sound like something he says in passing, but the key to answered prayer is what he
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.060]   says here.
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:39.820]   "I urge you to pray by our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.620]   Next week we're going to be talking about what does it mean to pray by the love of the
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.980]   Spirit.
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:48.300]   But he says to pray by our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.300]   By our Lord.
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:53.220]   To pray according to his will.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:57.240]   Over and over again, Paul says everything that he does at the end of verse 32, by the
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.240]   will of God.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:04.800]   See, the difference between a Christian and non-Christian is a Christian who, he now lives
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.520]   according to the will of God.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:11.140]   Versus a non-Christian who is continuing to live according to his will.
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:16.400]   On the surface it may look the same, but a non-Christian is a person who's never established
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.260]   Christ as Lord.
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.520]   Think about what repentance is.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.800]   When you repented, what did you repent of?
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.100]   Did you repent of foul language?
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.880]   Did you repent because you hurt somebody?
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.720]   Did you repent because you stole?
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:35.560]   I mean we repented that for sanctification, but the initial repentance was a repentance
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.760]   of a general rebellion against God.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:45.080]   Where we were living for our glory, for our satisfaction, and as the scripture says, that
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:53.200]   wrath of God remains because people refuse to acknowledge God and to give thanks to him.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.760]   So a difference between a Christian and a non-Christian, a Christian is an individual
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:01.880]   who repented that he's living independently from God.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:06.780]   He's not living for his will, he's living for his own will, his own life.
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:12.960]   And then you're hoping that God will help you live your life.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:19.720]   It is absolutely contradictory to say to live your best life now.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:26.920]   Your best life is to be crucified so that we can have his life.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.600]   That's the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:35.000]   It's a person who lives by God's will versus somebody who's lived by his will.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.720]   Paul says over and over again in 1 Corinthians 1.1, "I'm an apostle by the will of God."
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.520]   Romans 1.10, "That if I come to you, it's because of the will of God."
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:47.880]   Romans 8.27, "He prays according to the will of God."
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:52.720]   He says, Romans 12.2, "To renew your mind not to be conformed to this world so that
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.800]   you may know the will of God."
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.160]   1 Thessalonians 4.3, "Sanctification is the will of God."
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.880]   1 Peter 4.19, "Suffering is the will of God."
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.680]   Hebrews 10.36, "Glory comes after we have done the will of God."
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:09.600]   James 4.15, "Our whole life ought to be given for the will of God."
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.640]   1 Peter 5.2, "The church is being led by elders who live according to the will of God."
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:20.360]   1 John 2.17, "The one who lives are the one who do the will of God."
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.000]   Over and over again.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.640]   Our salvation is described as an individual who used to live by his will and now he's
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.640]   repented.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:32.680]   Now he lives according to God's will.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.640]   What does this have to do with prayer?
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:41.440]   Because prayer is contingent upon whether we live by his will or not.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:46.680]   The reason why we are not bold in our prayers is because we are not bold in obedience.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:50.480]   Let me give you an example of that.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.580]   Remember when you were younger?
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:56.280]   Maybe you made some plans with your parents and not with your parents, but a bunch of
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.480]   your friends and decided you're going to watch this movie.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:02.360]   But you don't have enough money and you need 30 bucks.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.920]   You need like 12 bucks.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:04.920]   What is it now?
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.640]   15 bucks for a movie ticket and 15 bucks for dinner.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.080]   So you need 30 bucks.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.720]   And so, you know, your parents have been on your case.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.920]   You're not doing your chores and you don't have the assistance.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.720]   So you know if you ask them for 30 bucks, you know what they're going to say.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.460]   Do your chores, right?
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:22.400]   So before you go and ask, you're going to do your chores.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.560]   You're doing dishes, you know, asking your mom, "Does your feet hurt?
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:26.600]   Let me massage your feet."
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:33.020]   You're all in preparation to milk that $30 out of your parents, right?
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.020]   So you're just kind of squirming.
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.020]   You're looking for a thing to do.
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.220]   You wake up in the morning, you're doing all this stuff and your parents notice.
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:39.220]   We notice, right?
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:42.960]   At the end of the day, he's going to ask for something.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.960]   So they come meekly.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.960]   "My friends are going.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.360]   This is a really good movie, you know.
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.360]   These are good kids.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.360]   They're not bad kids.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.360]   We're going to be back on time.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.920]   We're going to eat healthy."
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:57.240]   You know, and you're basically setting it all up because, you know, you're trying to
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:01.880]   get something that your parents probably are not maybe willing to give to you.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:08.600]   And so you're setting it up, it's like, "Ninckin' ahead."
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:16.560]   Versus, SAT is coming up, your parents have been on your case to study, you know, the
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:22.240]   testing of the deadline to pay the bill, $250, whatever it is, it's coming up and it's Saturday,
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.240]   you know, and you need to pay this.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:29.040]   And you know that your parents have been trying to get you to get on top of this and it comes
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.400]   and you wake up in the morning and you knock it to the side.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.800]   I need $250, right?
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.600]   I need it.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.360]   And he asked with boldness.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.360]   He's not ashamed.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.160]   He's not massaging anybody's feet.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.920]   He's not cleaning up anything.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.240]   You know, like everything's exactly the same.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.240]   He doesn't care.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.640]   He's like, he knows.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.440]   This is your will.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.240]   He knows the parents want him to pay this.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.560]   And this is what he wants.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:02.880]   So he's able to come to the thing, boom, and the parents are like, "What?
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.200]   $250 for what?"
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.600]   SAT, "Oh, okay, get my book, right?
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.600]   Go get it."
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.640]   "Why are you asking me now?
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:12.920]   You should have asked me three weeks ago.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.080]   Why did you wait so long?"
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:21.840]   You see the difference between praying according to his will versus praying for my will?
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:27.680]   And the reason why we do not pray with boldness and urgency and desperation and agonizing
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:35.720]   together is because we don't have a clear conscience in the way we live.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:40.640]   You don't just turn that on and off in prayer.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:47.080]   Prayer is in line with who we are and what we do.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:51.920]   John chapter 14, 13 to 14, "Whatever you ask in my name, that I will do so that the
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.020]   Father may be glorified in the Son.
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:57.200]   If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it."
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:03.600]   I remember back at Biola, you know, I grew up in a pastor's family and after I got
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.200]   saved I went to Biola and I was studying the Bible.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:13.240]   And I remember the very first time we had an assembly of 3,000 students and this great
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:17.720]   preacher preached and at the end of his sermon he just said, "Amen," and then he walked
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.440]   off.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.480]   And I remember that's the first time I've ever heard somebody pray without saying, "In
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.880]   Jesus' name," you know what I mean?
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.720]   So all kinds of thoughts were going through my head.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.080]   He didn't say, "In Jesus' name."
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.080]   Is that legitimate?
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.480]   Is Jesus going to answer that?
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.080]   He didn't say, "In Jesus' name."
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.440]   He didn't give a stamp of approval.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.920]   Obviously is that what he means?
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:47.800]   No matter what you want, if you say, "In Jesus' name," there's power behind it.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.800]   Is that what he means?
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.800]   Obviously that's not that.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.800]   You're more sophisticated than I was back then.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:36:00.720]   In Jesus' name means to pray, covered by the blood of Christ, by His will, that we
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:06.720]   are praying what He would pray because we are going where He wants to go and we are
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.700]   asking what He wants to ask.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.560]   That's what it means to pray in Jesus' name.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:16.340]   He said, "When you pray in Jesus' name," he said, "I will answer you."
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.760]   He probably wants it more than we do.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:24.720]   He wants the salvation of the lost more than we do.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:31.200]   He probably wants you to pray for your own sanctification more than you do.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:37.720]   The people in your lives that do not know Christ and He's desperately waiting for you
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:42.800]   to petition them on their behalf.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.120]   He wants that more than you do.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:51.560]   And so when we come before God and we decide for ourselves that this is what we want, He
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.920]   says, He promises He will answer.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:59.040]   John 15, 16, "You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed that you would go
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:05.440]   and bear fruit and that your fruit will remain so that whatever you ask of the Father in
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.600]   my name, He will give it to you."
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:12.200]   Repeatedly, over and over again, it says, "I will answer you if you pray according to
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.200]   my will."
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.920]   First John 3, 22, "And whatever we ask, we receive from Him because we keep His commandment
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.520]   and do the things that are pleasing in His sight."
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:26.040]   First John 5, 14, "This is the confidence which we have before Him, that if we ask anything
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:32.120]   according to His will, He hears us."
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:35.840]   You know what makes Christian life exciting?
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.840]   God.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.280]   God.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:46.840]   When you encounter God, all the other stuff that seems like such a big deal becomes nothing.
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:51.960]   What's exciting about the church, our Christian life, is not the church.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:58.560]   Because the church sometimes is encouraging and sometimes very discouraging.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.840]   Friends are there sometimes when you need them and sometimes when you need them, they
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.520]   are not there.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.560]   It's not your family.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.920]   It's not the growth.
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.360]   It's not the activities.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.200]   All of these things come and they go.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.920]   Sometimes it's great and a lot of times it's not.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.400]   What makes Christian life exciting is God.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:27.480]   Because that was the one thing you didn't have before you met Christ.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.560]   You could have had money.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.800]   You didn't come to Christ because you couldn't make friends.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.880]   You didn't have to repent because you couldn't get a job without Christ.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.400]   Or you wanted to belong to a community.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:44.800]   You could have joined some key club, some country club and made money and played golf
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.600]   with other people who are like you.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.600]   I mean, you could have gotten all of that.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:53.680]   What was missing was Christ.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:57.560]   It was because we've encountered Christ and we want more and that's why we keep coming
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.000]   because we want that.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.680]   And the primary way he calls us to encounter him is first and foremost to pray.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:14.460]   A Christian who does not pray does not know the joy of what it means to be a Christian.
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.780]   You may pretend.
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.040]   You may get excited about certain events.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.380]   You may be excited about getting more friends.
[00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:25.960]   You may be excited about certain things that are happening at the church.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:33.120]   But you do not know the joy of what it means to follow Christ because the living water
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.440]   is not in your friends.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:40.720]   The living water is not in the activity.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.360]   Christ is the bread.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.600]   He's the living water.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:50.560]   And that's why he says above everything else be devoted to pray.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.120]   Be devoted to pray.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:55.160]   Be committed to pray.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:59.760]   Make meeting Christ the primary thing in your life.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.960]   Not building my family and making sure my children are taken care of.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.860]   God would you help me to do this?
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:11.600]   Not making sure that my business is successful and then God can you help me to do that?
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:15.880]   But the primary thing that God called us to is Christ.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:16.880]   To meet Christ.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:20.800]   And that's why Jeremiah 29, 13 it says you will seek me and find me when you search me
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.400]   with all your heart.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.980]   All your heart.
[00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:30.360]   Not just some of your heart.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.380]   Not just on the weekend.
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:37.560]   But have you committed your life all of it to Christ?
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:41.440]   Or do you just give tithe?
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.960]   You tithe your time.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.680]   You tithe your future.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.760]   You tithe your money.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:52.480]   And then the rest of it is for you.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.480]   Are we committed?
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.720]   Are we devoted?
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:01.320]   And until we are committed, until we are devoted, the very first place where you will see the
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:07.040]   ramification of an undevoted life is your prayers.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:10.880]   You won't be able to pray.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:16.400]   Because the things that God wants you to pray for is not on your heart.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.960]   That's not what you want to pray for.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.360]   You want to pray for more money.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.040]   You want to pray for more security.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.580]   You want to pray for a better relationship.
[00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:25.920]   You want to pray for security.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.160]   You want to pray for all these things.
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.280]   But that's not where God's heart is.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:34.000]   You're not praying according to his name.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.160]   Psalm 119, 2, how blessed are those who observe the testament, who seek him with all their
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.160]   heart.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.020]   Psalm 119, 10.
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:45.760]   With all my heart I have sought you.
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.040]   Do not let me wander from your commandments.
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.800]   Psalm 119, 15.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.980]   I sought your favor with all my heart.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.340]   Be gracious to me according to your word.
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.880]   And then Psalm 119, 145.
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.160]   I cried with all my heart.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.940]   Answer me, O Lord.
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:07.200]   And then finally in Jeremiah 24, 7, he says in the new covenant, he says, I will give
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.880]   them a heart to know me for I am the Lord and they will be my people and I will be their
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:22.080]   God for they will return to me with all their hearts.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.980]   That's at the center of our frustration.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.400]   It's not because we're not attending church.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.320]   It's not because we don't own the right Bible.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.560]   It's not because we're not surrounded by right friends.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:41.040]   It's not because of all these other things.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:46.040]   We've made friends our resources.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:50.800]   We go looking for counselors before we ever pray.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:43:01.680]   We research books and we attend conferences and maybe even do Bible studies.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:12.560]   All while avoiding the source that God has given us, the main source, which is God himself.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:19.200]   Until we are encountering Christ, you will always be frustrated.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.880]   You will be frustrated in evangelism.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.620]   You will be frustrated in fellowship.
[00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:23.980]   You will be frustrated in mission.
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.320]   You will be frustrated at school.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:29.640]   Just a matter of time.
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:35.000]   Because everything in this world is rotting.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.040]   Because if your food is coming from this world, it will rot.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.800]   It's fresh when you take it off the tree.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.800]   Give it some time.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.320]   It will rot.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:47.520]   Because everything in this world eventually rots.
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:53.080]   The only thing that is eternal is God himself.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.640]   Now what is the application of all of this?
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.640]   Friday prayer meeting.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.640]   Friday prayer meeting.
[00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:04.200]   So the whole thing was about getting you to come Friday prayer meeting.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:08.280]   So the reason why we set aside Friday is again, the Friday prayer meeting doesn't mean that
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:12.760]   oh therefore I came Friday so we're devoted to prayer.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:16.320]   But we have to do something.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:17.920]   That's our weakness at church.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:19.560]   And I admit it.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.080]   And we recognize this early on at church.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:25.160]   This is like how do we address this issue?
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.280]   And again, praying together on Friday doesn't mean like oh we're done.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:32.720]   Once a month on Friday so we pray so we're good.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.300]   But that's a start.
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:38.920]   We want our church to be a church devoted to prayer.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.780]   Some of you guys are really good at praying.
[00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:43.780]   Help us.
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:45.480]   Help us.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.000]   Don't just say how come those people aren't praying.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   Pray.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.320]   Pray for us.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:53.600]   Pray and then get other people to pray with you.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.840]   Call other people.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.520]   Start a prayer meeting.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.520]   Don't wait for the church.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.800]   We're not praying.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:03.240]   All the leaders are busy running 15 things.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:08.280]   If you are frustrated that we're not praying enough, you're the first person that I encourage
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.080]   you to help us as a church to be more prayerful.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:14.880]   Because we are in desperate need of prayer.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:21.080]   Because there's an anxiousness in my heart that all that is happening in our church can
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.140]   easily be man's work.
[00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:27.960]   And I know what man's work eventually ends in.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.760]   So we have to be devoted to prayer.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:35.200]   As much as we desire for the gospel to go out, as much as we desire a greater community,
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:39.240]   as much as we want to be more hospitable to the newer people coming in, as much as we
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:44.800]   want to be holy and do the right things, if we're not committed to prayer, all of that
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.600]   leads to self-righteousness.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:51.680]   All of that leads to just comfort.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.600]   It just doesn't lead to anything good.
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:46:01.760]   That's why Paul says, "I urge you, agonizomai, together, wrestle in prayer."
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:04.200]   First and foremost, application is going to be this Friday.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.120]   So I want to encourage you to devote yourself.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.400]   Don't casually pray, but devote yourself to prayer.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:16.080]   So this morning, as we open up the communion table, again, I want to encourage you, every
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:21.360]   Sunday when you come and you hear these messages and you say, "I'm convicted," and every time
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:25.920]   you're convicted and you do nothing about it, it actually has a negative effect on your
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.320]   heart because it hardens you.
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:30.400]   And the Word of God no longer has any effect on you.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:33.160]   So I want to encourage you.
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:37.560]   This is, again, this is not new, and I'm sure if you've been a Christian for a while, you've
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:41.680]   already known this, but be devoted to pray.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:42.960]   Don't wait for us to initiate.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:45.200]   Don't wait for your friends or your small group leaders.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.200]   Pray.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.200]   Just commit to pray.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:48.960]   Come early in the morning to pray.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:52.240]   Come before the service starts to pray.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.440]   Pray with your friends.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.440]   Pray in the morning.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.760]   Pray at night.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:00.960]   Help us if you notice that.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:06.080]   So I'm going to ask Pastor Nate to come help me, and we're going to open up the communion
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:08.360]   table.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.000]   And as we open up the communion table, and again, I want to remind you that the communion
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.640]   table is for those who have already confessed faith in Christ.
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:20.580]   And so if you are coming and you've been baptized, make sure you come through the sides and go
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:23.140]   down the middle so that we don't create traffic here.
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:27.780]   And if you're visiting us just observing, we ask that you would keep, stay at your seat
[00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:31.980]   because it is kind of an anniversary for those who committed their life to Christ.
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:34.800]   And again, when you come up, please come prepared.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:38.600]   Pray, and even though it is symbolic, it is a sacred time.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:43.080]   It is not to be taken lightly, and so we want you to be prepared when each one of you comes
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.080]   up.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:50.000]   So I'm going to open up in 1 Corinthians chapter 11.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.760]   Then after I read, I'll pray and I'll open up the communion table for us.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:56.400]   For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.920]   in the night in which he was betrayed took bread.
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.880]   And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.760]   Do this in remembrance of me."
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:08.920]   In the same way, I took the cup also after supper, saying, "This cup is a new covenant
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:09.920]   in my blood.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.740]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:16.560]   For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.560]   he comes."
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.800]   Let's pray.
