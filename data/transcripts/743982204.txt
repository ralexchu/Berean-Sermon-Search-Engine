[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.280]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 3, we're going to jump
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.120]   back into the study of Luke, Luke chapter 3.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.880]   And this is going to be a two-part series, and I'm going to finish the second part next
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.880]   week.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:32.520]   So read for us Luke chapter 3 verses 1 through 6.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.240]   I'm reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.120]   Now in the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.220]   Judea and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was a tetrarch of the reign
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:55.380]   of Eturea and to Trachinus, and Lysania was tetrarch of Abilene.
[00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.120]   In the high priests of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.840]   in the wilderness.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.600]   And he came into all the district around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.500]   for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.520]   As it is written in the book of the word of Isaiah the prophet, the voice of one crying
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.000]   in the wilderness, make ready the way of the Lord.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.960]   Make his path straight, every raven will be filled and every mountain and hill will be
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.280]   brought low.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.080]   The crooked will become straight and the rough road smooth and all flesh will see the salvation
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.080]   of God.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.080]   Let's pray.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.040]   Gracious Father, we thank you for the privilege that we have to be able to come and worship
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.220]   you.
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.360]   We pray that you would guide us and lead us and allow your word that you have ordained
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.280]   to speak to us, your word and only your word.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.760]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.440]   As we continue our study in the gospel of Luke chapter three, we're in a section where
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.940]   John the Baptist and his ministry is being introduced to us.
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.520]   And then shortly after Jesus is going to be introduced.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.100]   And then obviously we're going to be spending the rest of our time in the book of Luke focused
[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.400]   on the Messiah, Jesus Christ.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:18.160]   But today as John the Baptist is now being introduced to us after his initial introduction
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:26.200]   in the beginning of his birth, it starts out by introducing some very powerful, famous
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   people.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.760]   Tiberius, Pontius Pilate, Herod, Annas, Caiaphas, all of these people would have been very significant
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.040]   at that time.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.280]   But the interesting thing is they're not the main point.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.600]   If you would have somebody introduced to you and saying this is somehow connected to, you
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.560]   know, the president, the governor, the mayor, right?
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.840]   And you would think that some time would pass introducing, well, how are they connected?
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.680]   And so the significance and your ears would perk up to hear about like, what does he know?
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.680]   Is he their son?
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.680]   What's going on?
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.120]   The only reason why they're even mentioned is because they're trying to highlight when
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.440]   John began his ministry.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.960]   So the whole point of introduction of all of them is John himself.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.240]   And remember who John is up to this point.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.440]   He's just an obscure guy out in the wilderness.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.440]   Nobody knows who he is.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.200]   I mean, other than the fact that he was anointed to go ahead of Jesus, outside of that, John's
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.760]   a nobody.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.680]   He's not well educated, doesn't come from a particular pedigree.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.360]   I mean, he's not famous for any other reason other than the fact that an angel said that
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.600]   you're going to go ahead of Jesus and you're going to prepare for the way of the Lord.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.800]   In fact, all of human history, the central figure in all of human history is ultimately
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.440]   tied to Christ.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.960]   So whenever we study Caesar, whenever we study the Middle Ages, whenever we study whatever
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.480]   it is what we're studying, the real point of every authority, every human history, every
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:13.160]   government is to recognize that God is in the midst of that, in the context of that,
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.400]   redeeming his people for his glory.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.840]   And that's exactly how John is introduced today.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.960]   All these great people are here, but again, that's just a side point.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:27.580]   They're not going to come up again until there's some tie to them to what Christ is doing.
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.360]   But John the Baptist shows up on the scene, and obviously everything that we're studying
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.560]   here is to prepare for the coming of Christ, who's going to come in about six months.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.960]   John the Baptist was a walking indictment to the nation of Israel.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.680]   Everything about him made the leaders of Israel uncomfortable.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.800]   And so we're going to see that this morning, and how his presence shook up the nation of
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.220]   Israel before even Christ ever came.
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.560]   He caused such a stir that many people saw John the Baptist, like maybe he must be the
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.560]   Messiah.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.640]   And so he had so many similar qualities.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.040]   And again, I think because he was the cousin of Jesus, maybe there was also physical qualities
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.040]   similar to him.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.360]   And there was some confusion as John ended his ministry and Jesus was beginning his ministry,
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.080]   and people were beginning to ask, is that the Messiah?
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.200]   Or Jesus is John the Baptist?
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.960]   He did such a great job.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.720]   Whether it was physical, whether it was preaching about his presence, who he called out, his
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.020]   message, everything about him, he did such a good job preparing for the coming of Christ
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.660]   that there was some confusion.
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.380]   They had to identify he is or he is not.
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:48.080]   Well, John the Baptist was loved by Israel, but he was also very much hated by the nation
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.240]   of Israel, just like Jesus.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.780]   People who believed what he was saying, repentant, was baptized, they knew who he was.
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.120]   And they were coming to him from long distance to be baptized by him.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.260]   And then there were who were coming who John the Baptist would call out, and we're going
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.940]   to talk about that next week, about his message of repentance.
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.580]   And when they were indicted and they refused to repent, they ended up hating him as well.
[00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.060]   We're going to look at this morning, John's calling into ministry, and there's four parts
[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.260]   that we see here.
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:27.200]   The calling of John the Baptist, the timing of John's calling, the place of John's calling,
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.760]   and the message of John's calling.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.500]   Those are the four things that we're going to be looking at.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.220]   I'm going to be covering the first three, and then the fourth one, we're going to spend
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.220]   the most time on because most of the text that we're looking at is going to be dealing
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.820]   with that.
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:46.820]   So calling of John, the timing of John's calling, and then the place of John's calling.
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.020]   All of these things are significant because every single part of this was an indictment
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.900]   against the nation of Israel.
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.340]   First of all, the call of John.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:00.760]   If we look at the second part of verse two, he says, after he introduces all these people,
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.700]   he says, "The word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the wilderness."
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.500]   Now to us as modern readers, the word of God came to him, we can just take that as he read
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.480]   the word of God, or he read Isaiah, or something must have happened.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.180]   But first century Jew would have known very clearly when Luke says that the word of God
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.020]   came to John the Baptist, knew exactly what he was talking about.
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.700]   The interesting thing here is the word for word, right?
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.060]   Typically what's a Greek word for word?
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.060]   Lagos.
[00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.060]   It's not the only word though.
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.580]   There's another word, rema, right?
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.740]   And so we know the word lagos because it's often talked about in the Bible and talking
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.460]   about when we're talking about the Bible itself, it's lagos.
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.740]   When it said, you know, in the beginning was the word, and word was with God, word was
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.660]   God, it was lagos.
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.240]   But there's another word for word, rema.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:01.360]   And I think it's much more nuanced than this, but the easiest way to understand the distinction
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:07.500]   between lagos and rema is lagos is the written word and rema is the spoken word.
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.600]   Now that doesn't really do justice, but just for our sake, that's probably the easiest
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.500]   way for us to distinguish it.
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.540]   Lagos is the written word where God reveals his word.
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.660]   And again, it's not exact because sometimes God would give lagos to his prophets to go
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.220]   and speak.
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:29.180]   But in here in particular, when it says the word of God came to John, it uses the word
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:36.420]   rema, meaning that God spoke to him, that God specifically called him.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:41.740]   And the reason why this is significant is because in almost every instance that a specific
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:48.380]   prophet is called by God to represent him and speak to his people, that phrase exists,
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.340]   that God spoke to him.
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.420]   First Samuel 15.10, the word of the Lord came to Samuel.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.500]   Second Samuel 7.4, the word of the Lord came to Nathan.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.660]   First Kings 16.1, the word of the Lord came to Jehu.
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.380]   Jeremiah 1 verse 2, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah.
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.860]   Ezekiel 1.3, the word of the Lord came to Ezekiel.
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.700]   To Jonah, to Haggai, to Zechariah, again and again and again.
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:17.820]   So a first century Jew, when they read this, they would have known very specifically that
[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.700]   Luke is saying he's not just a guy who was speaking for God.
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.580]   He wasn't like the priests and the scribes and the Pharisees and the teachers of the
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.740]   law.
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.420]   He was the prophet that they've been waiting for.
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.340]   This was the fulfillment of Isaiah chapter 40 when he said that there's going to be a
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.260]   front runner that's going to go prepare the way of Christ.
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.380]   And he's that man.
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.900]   The word of the Lord came to John the Baptist.
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:50.380]   Now you have to remember, the last time that happened was with Malachi 425 years ago.
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:56.780]   So for over 400 years, this phrase was not given to any other human being.
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.620]   There was no prophet speaking for God.
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.620]   God kept silent.
[00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.500]   There was nobody coming before God.
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.260]   So everyone who spoke said, "Oh, I'm speaking for God."
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.260]   They were just regurgitating things that they heard.
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.620]   They were taking things that were already said and just kind of passing it along.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:18.380]   And in that process, in those 400 years, the word of God was completely perverted.
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.300]   Everyone did what they thought was right in their own eyes.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:26.780]   They created a religion that was independent, so independent of God, that when the Son of
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.100]   God actually showed up, he didn't fit.
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:34.500]   So for 400 years, the nation of Israel has been drifting away from God because God did
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.100]   not send his prophet.
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:44.620]   And so when Luke introduces John the Baptist to us, as one who has received his word, he
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:50.220]   was the last prophet, the last prophet that God would send to the nation of Israel from
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.700]   the old covenant.
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:11:00.820]   See, in Jeremiah 23, 21 to 22, God indicts the nation of Israel and specifically the
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.060]   so-called prophets and the leaders of that time.
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:08.540]   And he says this, "I did not send these prophets, but they ran.
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.220]   I did not speak to them, but they prophesied.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:16.500]   But if they had stood in my counsel, then they would have announced my words to my people
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:22.380]   and would have turned them back from their evil way and from the evil of their deeds.
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.980]   If these were my people, they would have turned from their sins."
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:32.940]   Instead, they were more concerned about the response that they would get from people and
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.660]   tickling people's ears.
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.660]   He said, "If they were my prophets and they were speaking on my behalf," he said, "they
[00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.380]   would have turned them from their sins.
[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.340]   But because I did not, they went and they ran and they spoke whatever they felt that
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.740]   they wanted to hear."
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:54.620]   Sad to say, I believe we're in that generation today.
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:55.620]   Sad to say.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.780]   You speak the word of God and people feel uncomfortable, you're a false prophet.
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:05.660]   If you say something that causes people to think twice and be convicted or feel bad about
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.460]   the way that they're living, that can't be from God.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.460]   That's legalism.
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:14.180]   God is about love and grace and peace and rest.
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:22.980]   He said that when John the Baptist showed up, they were in such poor condition.
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:28.540]   His very presence in the nation of Israel made people feel uncomfortable.
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:36.260]   So his introduction to us begins basically by saying, "Pay attention to John.
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.980]   Listen to John.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.060]   What he has to say is life and death."
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:45.100]   That's the very reason why Apostle Paul, in every letter, he begins by saying, "The servant
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.660]   of Christ, the slave of Christ, an apostle of Christ."
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:55.820]   And the reason why he's saying that is, "What I'm writing to you are not just my words."
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:13:00.860]   Whether it is of encouragement, whether it's about salvation, whether it is a rebuke, this
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.180]   is coming from God.
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:08.540]   So that's why every letter that is written in the epistles in the new covenant isn't
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.020]   coming from the mouth of a human being.
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.700]   We'll look at that when we study the second Peter.
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.660]   This is God speaking to you.
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:24.220]   And so John is introduced to us making sure that this was not just any ordinary man.
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.500]   This is not somebody who's self-willed.
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.620]   This is not somebody who just kind of thought of like, "Hey, you know what?
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.620]   I prefer this."
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.900]   This is coming from God himself.
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:35.900]   That was his calling.
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.980]   Second, the timing is important.
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:45.300]   Because in the timing, it highlights for us what is going on at that time.
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.180]   We see the same thing in Haggai chapter 1 verse 1.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.420]   And in many of the other prophets, where the word of the Lord came to them, they would
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:55.740]   describe for us who was the king, who was the governor, what was happening at that time.
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:00.700]   Haggai 1.1, it says, "The second year of Darius the king, on the first day of the sixth month,
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.700]   the word of the Lord came by the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel, the son of Shertiah."
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.700]   And then he goes on, "The governor of Judah."
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.700]   This is very common.
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.860]   If you read the Old Testament prophets, you'll see that this is the way that they're introduced.
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:17.340]   Now they're not just trying to put a pin in the historical timeline and saying, "Well,
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.700]   this is how they dated things," which is true.
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:25.540]   But by telling us who was the ruler, they're also telling us what they're speaking to,
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:30.820]   the context, the context in which the prophet is speaking.
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.120]   What is going on spiritually?
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.780]   What is going on politically that that prophet needed to say these things at that particular
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.980]   time?
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:49.640]   See, you can have somebody say the right things to the wrong people and be a false prophet.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:54.260]   You could say the wrong things to the right people and be a false prophet.
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.500]   You can say peace, peace to people who are under the judgment of God and you are a false
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.140]   prophet.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.580]   You can say judgment is coming from people who are in desperate need of encouragement
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.060]   and you're a false prophet.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.300]   You have to know who you're speaking to.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:14.540]   And so when John the Baptist shows up, the part of the reason why all these people are
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:19.840]   in the situation, it kind of gives us a background of what is happening at that time.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.920]   In fact, the New Covenant, in the New Testament, it goes even further than that.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.720]   It says Galatians 4, "For when the fullness of the time came, God sent forth his son,
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.640]   born of woman, born under the law."
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.300]   The fullness of time.
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.960]   So all of the things that he's describing here is describing the fullness of time.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:37.960]   God waited.
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.360]   This was not some random thing to happen.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.240]   God didn't wait until all the right things happened in order for him to come.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.920]   He said, no, he ordained this time.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:55.360]   All these other things took place because God ordained it and now all that God has done
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.000]   has been fulfilled in order for John to show up and for John to show up to prepare for
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.440]   the way of Christ.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.960]   So the question we ask is what made this the fullness of time?
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.360]   What made this the fullness of time?
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:12.000]   What made this God ordained time in particular?
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.840]   Remember, if you study through, again, I think you're doing the Old Testament survey now,
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.840]   right?
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.920]   As you are working your way through the Old Testament, you will see when you get to the
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:31.320]   prophets, repeatedly God says over and over again, the primary penalty for their sin is
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.040]   what?
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.200]   You don't have to yell it out loud, but those of you guys who know.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:41.760]   What was the primary thing, the consequence of Israel if they did not turn from their
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.260]   sins?
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:49.640]   That they would be under suppression of foreign kingdoms.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.000]   That's what he said.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.880]   That you will be taken away.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.680]   Nations that are pagans who do not know God are going to overpower you.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.840]   That your men and women are going to be carried on and they're going to become servants.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:06.600]   And every prophet that comes that warns the nation of Israel, if they do not turn from
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.360]   their sin, that they would lose their nation.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:17.440]   See, the highlight of what is happening here is that the penalty of the culmination of
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.640]   their sin has reached its peak.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:26.120]   See, it started with Assyria, the Babylonians, the Persians, the Greeks, and then now the
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.040]   Romans have been ruling over them.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:37.300]   So for over 700 years, because they would continue to rebel against God, foreign nations
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.800]   would dominate over them.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.720]   And the prophets kept on telling them, they're dominating over you, not simply because you
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.040]   didn't have the right military or the power or because you didn't have the right leaders,
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.760]   it's because you were disobedient to God.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:56.840]   For 700 years, some of them treated them well, like the Persians.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:01.400]   Some of them treated them horribly, like the Assyrians.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:07.560]   The Romans were the ones, the superpowers of this time, and they were under their suppression.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:15.320]   Tiberius Caesar, the emperor of Rome, he was particularly effective in ruling their vast
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.960]   universe, their domain.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:24.860]   Their problem was that they conquered so much land that they had a difficult time keeping
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.420]   them under their control.
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:36.240]   So what Romans did was they appeased the nominal Jews by giving them money, by establishing
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.360]   them.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:42.840]   And then the Jews who were serious about their faith, that we only have one God, that he
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:50.320]   would make sure that he would keep his foot on their neck so that they do not rebel.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:56.640]   And much of what we know about the cross came from this, their desire to control rebellion.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.940]   So Roman citizens were never crucified.
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:18:59.940]   It was against the law.
[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:06.820]   It was only given, and particularly for those who were rebelling against Rome.
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:15.620]   So just by saying Tiberius Caesar, any true Jew would have immediately had a knee-jerk
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.620]   reaction.
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.020]   They knew where they were at because of this.
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.500]   Pontius Pilate, the governor who ruled on behalf of Rome, he was the one who carried
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.420]   out all the edict that came from Rome.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:30.300]   Tiberius Caesar was a figurehead, but they never saw him.
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.060]   He rarely came into town.
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.660]   Pontius Pilate was the one who carried out justice.
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.260]   He was the one who could make the decision whether someone was going to be crucified
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.520]   or not crucified.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:48.620]   And under Pontius Pilate, we had three supposed rulers of Israel, Herod, Philip, and Lysanias,
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.700]   who were given certain parts of Israel.
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.780]   And the reason why they were given certain parts is because Herod the Great, who was
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:20:04.580]   not even a Jew, was established as the king of Israel by the Romans, Roman Caesar, again,
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:08.380]   the whole purpose to control the nation of Israel.
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:14.940]   So true Jews were, again, just hearing the name Herod, it would stir in them animosity
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:20.100]   because they knew that this is the nation of God and we have somebody who's not even
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.620]   a Jew ruling over us.
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:30.260]   But all of these people, as bad as all of that situation politically, the situation
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:36.600]   was, Annas and Caiaphas probably did the most damage.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.180]   Most historians believe that they weren't even Levites.
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:46.740]   None of these people in position was what God said, what God promised to Abraham.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.540]   This is all consequence of sin.
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:54.060]   In fact, you're only really supposed to have one high priest.
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:58.140]   And so the official high priest at this time was Caiaphas, and Caiaphas was the son-in-law
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.280]   of Annas.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.580]   And the reason why both of them are mentioned is because Annas didn't want to lose control.
[00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:09.820]   So he established a family member so that he can control what's happening in Israel
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.420]   through his son-in-law.
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:17.060]   So just by that definition, you can already see that these people were not ruling for
[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.660]   the purpose of worshiping God or keeping the temple pure.
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.820]   It was purely for their own power.
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:26.780]   So in every position, every one of these people that are mentioned here is a reminder to the
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:32.740]   nation of Israel that they're in this position because of their sin.
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.380]   This was a judgment against the nation of Israel.
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:40.020]   And this is the reason why these people are mentioned.
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:45.540]   Again, we're 2,000 years removed, and we may just read that as, oh, these were the
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:49.340]   rulers of that time, and they just happened to be running the temple, and these were the
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.020]   rulers of Israel.
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:56.100]   But a first-century Jew hearing every one of these names would have stirred in them
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:01.820]   animosity because this is not what they desired.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.980]   It was a result of their own sin.
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:10.900]   So the fullness of time that is talked about in Galatian is in reference to the fullness
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:16.900]   of the weight of their sin upon Israel because the Bible says that God waited in order for
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:17.900]   what?
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:21.100]   The law to become utterly sinful so that they would recognize.
[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.980]   In other words, have its full course.
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.940]   It's not just the beginning of the rebellion.
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:33.140]   It's at the tail end of the rebellion that all that they have done, all the consequences
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:38.140]   of what they have done in rebellion against God has piled up to this point that not only
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:47.540]   the foreign emperor, not just the local governor, but their own kings and their own high priests
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:52.220]   were going against what God said in the Bible.
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.900]   It was the fullness of time.
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:59.900]   In John 1, 1, it says, "He came to his own, and those who were his own did not receive
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.780]   him."
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.020]   You know, the nation of Israel talked about the coming of the Messiah probably more than
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.660]   any other topic.
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:12.860]   They talked about the Messiah more than anything that they talk about.
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:18.420]   My guess is no matter what subject they were on, it would always end with Jesus is coming
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:19.500]   or the Messiah is coming.
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.500]   The Messiah is coming.
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:26.860]   You have political issues, you feel the suppression, oh, the Messiah is coming.
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:31.420]   You don't have money to feed your kids when the Messiah comes.
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:39.020]   All the prophecies of what God is going to restore was fulfilled when the Messiah comes.
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:44.300]   So it was the top topic of every conversation, no matter what kind of Jew you were.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.940]   The Messiah is going to fix everything.
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:52.420]   When the Messiah finally came, they were so far gone.
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:58.260]   They were so deep into their rebellion, they didn't even recognize him.
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.380]   Not only did they not recognize him, they ended up rejecting him.
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:05.820]   In Luke chapter 9, 22, saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:10.820]   by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and be killed and be raised up on
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:11.820]   the third day."
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.940]   Why does Jesus say that he had to be rejected, not just by the nation of Israel, but he says
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:22.300]   by the elders and the leaders, the rulers of Israel?
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:28.700]   Because the rejection of the rulers of Israel, it symbolized the complete rejection.
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.020]   It wasn't just some few people who didn't believe.
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.700]   It wasn't just a few pockets of people who didn't see it.
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.860]   It's like when he's rejected, he was rejected by Israel as a whole.
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:42.180]   That's what he was saying.
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:46.300]   The leaders themselves were supposed to lead you to God, he's going to lead you away from
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:49.860]   God.
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:55.540]   Israel should have recognized the sign of the time, but they did not, because they were
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:59.820]   consumed with their own life, with their own thoughts, with their own pursuits.
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:06.900]   In the name of God, in the name of God, you sprinkle Jesus over it, give some prayer,
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.340]   and the Lord willing, of course God wants me to be happy.
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.300]   Of course God wants me to be healthy.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:17.680]   Of course God wants me to be a good father and a good mother.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.460]   Of course God wants that.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:28.060]   And we look at the scripture superficially and sprinkle some Jesus on it, assuming that
[00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:33.340]   must be from God, but when Jesus came, they didn't recognize him at all.
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.880]   The whole time they were waiting for the Messiah, and they didn't recognize him.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:42.620]   In Matthew 16, 1-4, the Pharisees, Sadducees came up and testing Jesus, they asked him
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.020]   to show them a sign from heaven.
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:49.720]   Prove yourself, because they couldn't tell what they were thinking he was going to be
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.380]   and who he was, they couldn't tell.
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:52.760]   They couldn't connect the dots.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:57.220]   So if you say what you say you are, and what other people are saying you are, give us a
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.220]   sign.
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:03.080]   And Jesus says to them, when it is evening, you say it will be fair weather, for the sky
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.080]   is red.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:09.280]   And in the morning there will be storm today, for the sky is red and threatening.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.800]   Do you know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but cannot discern the signs of
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.720]   the times?
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.640]   How are you so aware of how this world functions?
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.160]   It's like, oh, if you buy the house now, it's going to go up, and if you don't buy it now,
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:28.360]   the house price is going to go down, and if you don't jump in and buy this now, the sale
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.800]   is coming next week, and you got to do this, and you got to do that, and you know when
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:35.480]   to buy the stocks, you know when to get into this and get into that, but he says when it
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:41.080]   comes to spiritual matters, you are so dense.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.840]   God is standing right in front of you, and you don't recognize him.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:50.280]   The word of God is right in front of you, and you have no idea what it says.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.460]   This was an indictment against the nation of Israel.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:59.240]   The fullness of time was all that God was waiting for, to wait until the drowning man
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.360]   has no more power in himself.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:05.240]   He said it's the fullness of time.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.340]   And so John is sent in the middle of this.
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.680]   That was the timing.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:12.680]   And then third, the place of his calling.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.680]   The place of his calling.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.480]   It's also an indictment against the nation of Israel.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:22.880]   Wilderness, again, if you study the Bible, you know it is a significant place.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.840]   It was where people were ministered.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.560]   It was where Moses was, you could say, was trained for the great work that he needed
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.640]   to do.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:35.640]   God didn't send Moses into the palace of Pharaoh and learn the latest technology and all the
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:40.200]   wisdom and knowledge that comes from going educated in Pharaoh's palace.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:46.840]   Instead, he sent them out to the desert, to the wilderness, humbling him, emptying himself.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.240]   And when he realized he had nothing, he was ready.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:54.920]   So we know that wilderness is a place of preparation.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.800]   Where the nation of Israel, for 40 years, they marched around.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:03.440]   I mean, they're about to conquer greater nations, and all they learn how to do is to march around.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.520]   He said, when I tell you to sit down, you sit down.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.240]   When I tell you to get up, you get up.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:14.120]   That was their preparation, to not to turn from the Word of God to the left or to the right.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.280]   Don't be overly smart.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.680]   Just read the Bible and do what it says.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.320]   That's what they were learning for 40 years.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.320]   March.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.200]   If I tell you not to touch it, don't touch it.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.240]   If I tell you to go in, go in.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.360]   If I tell you to come out, come out.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.520]   Don't stand there and say, well, what does coming out mean?
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.560]   What is going out?
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.560]   Why do I have to do it now?
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.240]   How come we're moving at night?
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.040]   Why do I have to be in this order?
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.640]   Why so many animals?
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.720]   For 40 years, they were in basic training.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.840]   When your commanding officer tells you to jump, just jump.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.560]   See the place of his calling to the wilderness where Jesus himself was tested before he came
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:54.560]   to ministry.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.680]   It says this is where John the Baptist grew up.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.440]   He grew up there all his life.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:07.240]   In fact, in the Qumran community, in the extra biblical history, there's a mention of a
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.800]   Yohanan, John, a prominent person.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.320]   So most historians believe that it's a reference to John the Baptist.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:19.000]   So he kind of grew up just like the Qumran community was an obscure community.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.960]   The only reason that we know anything about the Qumran community is because of the Dead
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.440]   Sea Scrolls.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.920]   Outside of that, there's not much we know about them.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:31.880]   And John the Baptist grew up probably in that community.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:36.840]   And I think of all the things that we can highlight about what the wilderness was, I
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:42.400]   think the most practical thing that I believe that the reason why this is mentioned is because
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:48.380]   it was outside of the control of the leaders of Israel.
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.840]   Because if somebody was going to be prominent in the nation of Israel, there was a system
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:54.480]   that you had to come through.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.720]   You had to be a Jew.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:02.160]   And if you wanted to be great politically, you had to work yourself to become a Sadducee.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.560]   If you wanted to be a great teacher, you have to work yourself under their system and learn
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.640]   under the Pharisees and do what they tell you to do and grow up under that system so
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.480]   that they can place you in the place that they are in and maybe higher than that.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:22.960]   But instead, John the Baptist, who God has sent to prepare for the Messiah to come, forsook
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.960]   all of that.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.840]   He went out to the wilderness.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:32.760]   This is where poor people, insignificant people, uneducated people, people who have no power,
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.280]   people basically dropped out of society, this is where they go.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.960]   And it says it's in the wilderness that he called John the Baptist.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:49.720]   In fact, remember in Luke chapter 21 through 7, they were asking about who the John the
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.720]   Baptist is.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:56.760]   They were asking Jesus, "What authority do you have to come into this temple and yell
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.320]   at us and clean the temple out and tell people to get out?
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.160]   What authority do you have?"
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:06.880]   Well, Jesus, knowing what's in their heart, turns the table around and he asks them.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:10.840]   One of the days while he was teaching in the people in the temple and preaching the gospel,
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:15.440]   the chief priest and the scribes with the elders confronted him and they spoke saying
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.760]   to him, "Tell us by what authority you are doing these things.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.760]   So who is the one who gave you this authority?"
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:25.880]   Jesus answered and said to them, "I will also ask you a question and you tell me, was
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:30.040]   the baptism of John from heaven or from men?"
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:38.120]   Jesus already knew that they can't answer this question because these leaders functioned
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:40.120]   by the fear of man.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:44.320]   So whatever and however they answer this, there's going to be a segment of people who's
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.240]   going to hate them for their answer.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:51.200]   He said, "Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:55.480]   They reasoned among themselves saying, 'If I say from heaven, he will say, 'Why did
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.980]   you not believe him?'
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:03.040]   But if we say from men, all the people will stone us to death for they are convinced that
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.920]   John was a prophet.'"
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:10.900]   You see the leaders hated John the Baptist as much as Jesus because they would come to
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:15.400]   get baptized by him and he said, "You brood of vipers, who told you to repent without
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.400]   fruit?
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:21.720]   If your repentance is genuine, show it by your life.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.800]   Stop acting in public."
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.460]   And that's exactly what Jesus did when he confronted the nation of Israel.
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:34.680]   He would rebuke the leaders of Israel with the same indictment.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:40.200]   They hated John the Baptist but they couldn't get rid of him because they knew that it would
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.740]   be unpopular whatever they did.
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:47.320]   If they followed him, that means they would have to genuinely repent and admit that they
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.320]   were wrong.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.920]   If they didn't follow him, all the people who loved John the Baptist say, "Ah, these
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.920]   guys."
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:55.160]   So it was a no-win situation.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.960]   So they were probably very thankful that Herod got rid of him.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:03.840]   But with Jesus, he took what John did and took him at another level.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.520]   I mean the whole nation was stirred.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:14.820]   So we can kind of see what was going on, the spiritual background of what's going on.
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:21.100]   John the Baptist's very presence indicted the whole nation of Israel.
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:28.180]   And every part of what he says about his calling, that he was, the word of God came to him,
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:31.620]   he was unlike any other prophet, the scribes, the Pharisees, these guys are just kind of
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.900]   regurgitating information, saying what they think and add it to the law of God, their
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:40.020]   own traditions, and put that millstone on people's necks.
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.740]   It had nothing to do with the word of God.
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:48.980]   And he said, "No, John the Baptist is speaking from God directly.
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:55.940]   These people who are there suppressing their worship, the nation, as a result of their
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.180]   own sins, John breaks into that.
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:03.300]   And he's going to now speak for God himself."
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:11.260]   And then again, finally, it's the place of his calling itself is an indictment, in particular
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.380]   to the leaders of Israel.
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:17.860]   He went outside of the system that they've created.
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.980]   He went outside of the schools that they created.
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.020]   He was outside the seminaries.
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:26.260]   He went outside of their religious institution.
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.580]   He went outside the temple.
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:33.260]   In fact, even Jesus, as he was doing his ministry, because his own siblings didn't believe
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:37.460]   him, he said, "If you're doing all of these things, you should go to Jerusalem.
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.340]   You should go to Judea.
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:40.420]   That's where the power is.
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:44.180]   That's where the authority is, so that more and more people, so you can become a prominent
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:45.180]   person.
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:49.820]   Why are you doing over here in obscure Galilee?"
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:53.100]   It was very deliberate.
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:58.840]   In James 3, it says, "Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, knowing that
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:04.740]   as such we will incur a stricter judgment."
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:20.540]   Do not be so eager to represent God, because men have gone ahead of us with such confidence
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:25.420]   and ended up in greater judgment.
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:31.520]   Teachers must first and foremost be fearers of God.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:36.940]   If you represent God and you are in greater fear of how people will respond because of
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:42.540]   your words, you are no longer representing God.
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.700]   You're representing yourself.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:52.740]   You cannot be a man who says, "God says this," and be filled with fear of what this may lead
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.660]   to.
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:36:02.340]   You cannot, because from that moment on, your message will be tailored to what people
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.340]   desire to hear.
[00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:07.560]   That's what was going on at this time.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:11.720]   When Jesus ended His ministry, He ended His ministry with an indictment against the leaders
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.720]   of Israel.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:17.600]   Matthew 23, 13, "But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:22.120]   off the kingdom of heaven from people, for you do not enter in yourself, and nor do you
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.860]   allow those who are entering to go in."
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:30.780]   Because of your misrepresentation of God, not only are you not bringing them in, you're
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:33.120]   preventing them from coming in.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:41.540]   Not only are you not going in, He said, "Everybody that trusts you will be also led astray."
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:45.980]   Matthew 23, 15, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel
[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:51.700]   around on sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he becomes one, you make him twice
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:55.180]   as much a son of hell as you yourselves."
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:37:00.140]   Working so hard to disciple people, to influence people, and at the end of the day, they're
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:04.300]   like you and worse.
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:07.540]   And then Matthew 23, 25, it says, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:13.300]   you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:16.940]   and self-indulgence."
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.500]   You're eloquent with words.
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:23.140]   You speak many words.
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.060]   And all of it is a presentation.
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:28.500]   Your heart is filled with bitterness, anger, pride.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:38.420]   He said, "You're so concerned about the external, you're almost blind to the internal,
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:41.920]   what is happening inwardly."
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:47.140]   True worship, you know, is not raising hands and singing songs.
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:51.340]   True worship is what happens here and it leads to singing songs and raising hands.
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.340]   But going like this doesn't make it real worship.
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.540]   Singing out loud doesn't make it worship.
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.980]   Having great music behind us doesn't make it great worship.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:02.720]   Having the room packed with people doesn't make it great worship.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:09.100]   Great worship is something that happens within us because God is sanctifying us.
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:14.780]   The Word of God is rebuking us, revealing the thoughts and intentions of my heart.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:20.740]   And again, as leaders, and I would say I'm probably the most in danger of this because
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:27.100]   I'm the lead pastor in this church, because it's part of my job to be concerned for your
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:34.500]   souls, that there is a great temptation for me to focus all my attention on what is happening
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:41.180]   with you and not enough on what's happening with me.
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:48.820]   And it's not done deliberately, but my job, if I do it well, humanly speaking, causes
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:56.500]   me to become an expert of who you are and a dunce of what's happening in here.
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.060]   Because I go, "Yeah, yeah, I'm preaching the Word of God, so I'm in front of the Word of
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.900]   God all the time.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:05.460]   All the time, you know, Monday through Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I'm in front of the Word
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.100]   of God."
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:11.140]   But the temptation for me is when I'm in front of the Word of God, what's in my mind isn't
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.100]   what is God saying to me.
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.260]   How is God indicting me?
[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:21.020]   When I'm in front of the Word of God, my temptation is what does God have to say to you?
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:25.540]   Every once in a while, something will creep in to convict me, but majority of the time,
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.140]   it can easily be what is God saying to you?
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:31.220]   Because that's my job.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:38.400]   And I admit, I am in the position of greatest temptation for that, but you are not free
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.780]   from that.
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:48.340]   How much of your attention is your frustration with other people?
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:52.220]   How much of your attention is about you?
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.620]   About your heart?
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.460]   About your drifting?
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.540]   About your compromise?
[00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.020]   About your sins?
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:03.780]   See, these leaders didn't become this way overnight.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:10.240]   The leader became this way as they continued to drift, and pride began to come in, and
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:15.380]   God no longer was speaking to them, and they kept on speaking anyway.
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:21.140]   And not only did it ruin them, but it ruined the nation.
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:25.440]   It was in this that John the Baptist was breaking in.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:31.320]   And every part of John the Baptist was to call out this sin.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:35.020]   And that's why the people who are hungry for God loved him.
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:40.240]   People who are trying so hard to hold on to their power hated him.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:44.000]   So if there's anything for us to learn, again, you know, if you didn't like this message,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.680]   you're going to hate next week's message, right?
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:50.560]   Because all of this is the circumstance surrounding his indictment.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:55.080]   Well, he's going to open his mouth, and he's going to actually start to say it.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.420]   And we're going to look at that next week.
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:02.520]   But for this week, let me conclude with this text in Hebrews chapter 13, 11 to 14.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:06.460]   For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high
[00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:11.240]   priest as an offering for sin are burned outside the camp.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.300]   Therefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people through his own blood suffered
[00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.240]   outside the gate.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:22.340]   So let us go out to him outside the camp bearing his reproach.
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:31.500]   For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city which is to come.
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:39.440]   Sometimes being overly concerned about conforming is what leads you to sin.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:47.380]   Sometimes being overly concerned about fitting in causes you to drift from God.
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:52.640]   And being overly concerned about how people react if I say this and don't do this leads
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:56.660]   us to become blind to the truth of the word of God.
[00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:02.900]   Just as John the Baptist broke into this darkness of Israel, when you hear the word of God,
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.740]   where does God take you?
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.540]   What is he calling?
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:10.240]   What are the sins that we've compromised in?
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:13.100]   What are the areas that we are blind in?
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.600]   And obviously you wouldn't know that or else you wouldn't be blind to it.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.460]   So we come before the Lord.
[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:23.540]   What areas of my life have I hardened?
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:28.100]   In what areas have I cleaned the outside but yet inwardly?
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.340]   I'm allowing all kinds of sins to come in, all kinds of compromise.
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:35.900]   I become blinded because of that.
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:43.940]   And as we meditate upon John the Baptist's ministry, and again like I said, if you are
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:47.140]   offended by anything I said today, don't come next week.
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:51.220]   Because next week is at another level.
[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:55.580]   There's actual words to what John the Baptist is going to say.
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:58.860]   He's going to go deep.
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:07.940]   But if we're going to see true revival, if we're going to truly worship God, we need
[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:11.100]   to know what God thinks.
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.100]   Not what you want.
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:16.080]   We need to know what God thinks of our situation.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.500]   What God thinks about our life.
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.380]   What God thinks.
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:24.380]   And that we would align our lives according to what God desires.
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:27.180]   So that we would invite God into our life.
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:31.620]   Not just our church, not just our friends, not just our circumstance, but God.
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:40.340]   Let's pray.
[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:45.100]   Heavenly Father, we praise you, we thank you.
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:50.260]   Lord help each one of us to honestly pray.
[00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:51.260]   Search me and know me.
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:53.900]   See if there's any hurtful ways in me.
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.620]   In me, Lord.
[00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.380]   What am I blind to?
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.180]   What have I excused?
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:05.180]   Where is my indulgence?
[00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.740]   Where is my pride?
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.420]   Where is my attention?
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.580]   Where is my worship?
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:17.060]   I pray, Father God, that your word would continue to speak to us, guide us, convict us.
[00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:20.220]   That we may have you and you alone.
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:21.580]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
