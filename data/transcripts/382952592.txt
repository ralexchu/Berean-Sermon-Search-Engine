[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - I always thought that spring and summer
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   were the seasons for weddings,
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.080]   but I guess things have changed a little bit.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.240]   In the past six weeks, I've been to four weddings.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.640]   My kids were in two of them.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.720]   I was the officiant in one of them.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.880]   And some of you may be here this morning
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.320]   because you're in town for a wedding.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.880]   So it's been a little bit of a busy season for our church.
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.160]   In fact, next Saturday,
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.840]   there are two church members' weddings.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.040]   I'll be officiating at one, Pastor Mark at the other.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.680]   So that'll be five weddings in seven weeks for me.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.740]   And so as joyful as it is, I'm a little tired.
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.720]   Now in the context of each and every wedding,
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.840]   you hear the words like covenant and vow,
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.560]   and those are beautiful words in the context of a wedding.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.080]   Yes, they are weighty, but no one views the exchange
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.400]   of vows at a wedding as something negative
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.800]   or something burdensome.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.640]   The words covenant and vow, though sacred and holy,
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.920]   are beautiful words.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.920]   At a wedding, they're not legalistically perceived,
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.840]   nor is the accountability that comes with the covenant
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.240]   something that the couple fears or dreads.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.880]   And ultimately, the desire in making that covenant
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.000]   is for the mutual benefit and mutual edification
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.760]   through the promise that they make.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.160]   Now, why am I beginning this sermon in this way?
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.720]   Just before the holidays, we started a sermon series
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.560]   reviewing each of the aspects of our church's
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.680]   just membership covenant,
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.680]   the 10 things our members commit to upon joining our church.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.200]   And for most of last year,
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.600]   we had been in the book of Hebrews,
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.400]   but with Pastor Peter's sabbatical,
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.520]   we decided that it would be good for our church
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.200]   to take some time to review
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.160]   and reflect on these 10 covenants.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.480]   So hopefully, as we are going over these church covenants,
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.960]   these also you find to be beautiful and holy.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.280]   May they not be burdensome.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.960]   May they not cause you to feel restricted, but rather free.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.120]   And hopefully, you find our time reviewing the covenants
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.760]   to be a beneficial and edifying exercise.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.200]   And so of our 10 membership covenants,
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.920]   we've thus far covered one through five, and then seven.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.800]   We've been going over them mostly in order,
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.120]   but we've just switched up the orders of a few of them
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.600]   and have jumped around just a little bit.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.880]   It's been over a month since we've been in the covenants.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.560]   So for the sake of review,
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.080]   I would like for us to briefly read the covenants
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.840]   that we have already covered.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.320]   Okay, they're gonna be up there on the screen for you.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.080]   Covenant one, I confess Jesus Christ
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.680]   as my Lord and Savior.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.240]   Two, I confess that the Bible is an inerrant word of God,
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.200]   which has ultimate authority over my life.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.280]   Three, I commit to a life of devotion
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.840]   to pray regularly interceding for the leadership
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.720]   and the members of Berean Community Church.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.280]   Four, I commit to attending Sunday worship
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.640]   at Berean Community Church every week
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.920]   to the best of my ability.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.000]   Five, I commit to attending and preparing
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.640]   for weekday Bible studies every week
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.920]   to the best of my ability.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.960]   Six, we'll cover next week.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.080]   Seven, I commit to building up
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.600]   and strengthening the body of Christ
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   at Berean Community Church by developing
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.080]   and using my spiritual gifts.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.840]   Today, we're gonna be jumping ahead a little bit
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.920]   to covenant number nine.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.280]   We'll be covering covenant six, eight, and 10
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.600]   in the coming weeks.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.960]   But today, we're gonna be looking at covenant number nine,
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.160]   especially as this will be a very important one
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.800]   for our church in the year 2020,
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.600]   as Hans and Franz has already given you a preview of.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.880]   So here's covenant number nine.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.360]   It reads, I commit to the best of my ability
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.200]   to advance the kingdom of God
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.160]   through sharing the gospel locally and globally.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.600]   So the commitment here is to share the gospel,
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.760]   the good news of Jesus Christ.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.720]   And this is a commitment to simply testifying
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.360]   of God's goodness in the mission fields we are already in.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.840]   And Lord willing, getting involved in the mission fields,
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.840]   he places us perhaps farther away,
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.280]   preaching Jesus near and far, both locally, globally,
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.200]   and praying for those who are preaching Jesus
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   both near and far, both locally and globally.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.200]   So for the about 400 of you who have signed this covenant,
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.320]   I believe you agree to this because this falls in line
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.120]   with the teaching of the scriptures.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.120]   Our God loves sinners and we serve a missionary God.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.680]   And we are called always to be ready
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.640]   to testify to his goodness.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.720]   The apostle Paul writes in Ephesians 6.15,
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.560]   after he exhorts the church to put on the full armor of God,
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.800]   and having shod your feet with the preparation
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.400]   of the gospel of peace.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.120]   I actually did not, I used to teach the SAT verbals,
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.640]   but I did not know what shod meant.
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.080]   I assumed what it meant,
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.720]   but it's the past tense of the verb to shoo.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.720]   So having put shoes on, I felt good
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.320]   'cause I asked Pastor Mark and he didn't know either.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.000]   So we're all in good hands, okay?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.640]   Basically, Paul is saying to always shoo your feet
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.080]   with preparation to testify.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.840]   And the imagery is similar to what we see in Isaiah 52.7,
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.800]   which reads, "How lovely on the mountains
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.000]   "are the feet of him who bring good news,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.280]   "who announces peace and brings good news of happiness,
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.720]   "who announces salvation and says to Zion,
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.600]   "Your God reigns."
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.120]   So I wanna read Covenant Nine again for you.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.880]   "I commit to the best of my ability
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.080]   "to advance the kingdom of God
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.640]   "through sharing the gospel locally and globally."
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.840]   And we're gonna be spending the bulk of today's sermon
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.840]   on what will be a very familiar passage to much of you,
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.920]   to many of you.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.080]   So allow me to read it for all of us today.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.080]   It's gonna be Romans 10, verses 11 to 17.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.040]   Romans 10, 11 to 17.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.040]   It reads, "For the scripture says,
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.040]   "whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.040]   "For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.040]   "For the same Lord is Lord of all,
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.840]   "abounding in riches for all who call on him.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.040]   "For whoever will call on the name of the Lord
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.040]   "will be saved.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.560]   "How then will they call on him
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.640]   "in whom they have not believed?
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.040]   "How will they believe in him whom they have not heard?
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.160]   "And how will they hear without a preacher?
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.360]   "And how will they preach unless they are sent?
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.440]   "Just as it is written,
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.840]   "how beautiful are the feet of those
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.560]   "who bring good news of good things.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.560]   "However, they did not all heed the good news,
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.560]   "for Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.960]   "So faith comes from hearing,
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.960]   "and hearing by the word of Christ."
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.480]   I'm gonna give you the outline up front
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.760]   so that it'll be easier for you to track along.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.080]   Hopefully, you find it simple enough
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.760]   and easy enough to follow.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.560]   The first point, and it's all gonna be
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.960]   out of this Romans 10 passage,
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.960]   is that one, there is good news,
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.680]   Romans 10, 11 to 13.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.680]   Two, there's a dying audience in need of good news,
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.880]   Romans 10, 14 to 15.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.960]   Three, there is a divine strategy
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.920]   in the delivery of the good news,
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.880]   Romans 10, 16 to 17.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.960]   So I'm gonna start with the first one.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.960]   There is good news.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.360]   The word gospel in Greek is euangelion,
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.280]   the combination of the word, the root eu,
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.280]   like eulogy, euphemism, which means good.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.360]   And you put that together with angelion,
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.280]   the Greek word for message.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.280]   So the word evangelism comes from the combination
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.480]   of these two roots, eu and angelion.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.360]   And what's the difference between news,
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.360]   information, and good news?
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.280]   And I'm gonna give you a couple of examples
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.560]   to help us emotionally wrap our minds
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.960]   around the difference.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.880]   On the average Sunday, we have 130 children
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.760]   in our education department,
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.280]   worshiping in the rooms behind you and above you.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.480]   It's about 130.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.320]   Now I'm gonna give you some news.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:52.000]   Church, your children are safe.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.960]   That would be news, okay?
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.600]   On a typical Sunday, you would think,
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.480]   okay, that's a good thing.
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.680]   And you'd be slightly happy about it, hopefully,
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.840]   and then it would not affect you much at all.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.000]   In fact, most of you parents would be
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.800]   somewhat ambivalent about it,
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.880]   because this is news that is expected.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.360]   It's assumed, it's a given.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.360]   It's an expectation, perhaps even a demand
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.920]   or a non-negotiable.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.520]   So in your heart, you may be thinking,
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.080]   yeah, they better be safe.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.480]   What kind of church is this if they don't keep them safe?
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.520]   But if we had just heard a huge explosion
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:40.520]   in the back, if there's a huge earthquake
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:45.040]   and we see the back part of our church collapse,
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:50.560]   the words, your children are safe,
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.760]   would not be holham angelion.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:59.640]   It would be exceptionally you, angelion, truly good news.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.120]   Here's another example.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.600]   If I were to tell every one of you sitting in this room,
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   hey, great news, you don't have AIDS.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:15.800]   Hey, brother, sister, you are cancer-free.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.680]   Most of you would not have an emotional reaction
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.560]   or like a joy-filled celebration at this news.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.920]   Tears of happiness would likely not fill your eyes.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.240]   But for someone who had been diagnosed with cancer,
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.160]   had been going through all kinds of the horrific treatment
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.480]   to beat it, who had been told that this cancer was terminal,
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:44.240]   this would in fact be great, life-altering, earth-shattering,
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.760]   fantastic and wonderful news,
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.440]   news that you would shout at the top of every rooftop,
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:55.120]   post on every social medium, tell every friend,
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.920]   every stranger, and this would be news
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.360]   that you cannot contain.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.120]   And each proclamation of this good news
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.000]   would be overflowing with joy, inexpressible,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.520]   and insuppressible, like just glee.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.680]   And you would be so convincing
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.760]   that everyone in your hearing would celebrate with you.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.400]   So this begs the question,
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.440]   is the message that Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.680]   died on the cross for your sins
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.240]   to restore you to your holy creator
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.960]   and give you eternal life,
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:40.080]   is this truly, you, Angelion, good news to you?
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.160]   Perhaps for some of us in this room,
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.920]   we subconsciously believe we deserve to be saved.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.960]   Maybe you are a fourth-generation Christian
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.840]   from a family of pastors or even martyrs, perhaps.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.960]   Maybe you're naturally just a nice, sweet person.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.800]   You share with those in need.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.240]   You don't cheat on your taxes.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.240]   And though you're not perfect, you're better than most.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.840]   In your heart of hearts,
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.760]   maybe you don't believe you are deserving
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.240]   of the hatred and the full and unbridled just wrath of God.
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:20.280]   Then the message of the cross won't move you to worship.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.480]   It will not be good news to you.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.400]   It will be an expectation that you have.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:32.400]   It'll be religious information to which you just say, duh.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.560]   It'll be assumed.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.760]   And for some of you who wrestle with doubt and skepticism,
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.680]   the gospel of Jesus Christ may be elevated a little bit
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.800]   to wishful thinking or superstition.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.440]   But tragically, perhaps the gospel of Jesus Christ
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.360]   to some of you sitting in here may be even a burden
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.800]   or even a hindrance to getting the best out of this life.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.040]   Man, if I only wasn't a Christian,
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.560]   I would, and then you fill in the blank.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.280]   Man, if I wasn't like a churchgoer,
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:12.360]   man, if I wasn't like a servant of the Lord,
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.480]   I would, and then you fill in the blank.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.680]   Covenant number nine will be cumbersome and oppressive
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.320]   if the message of the cross is only information
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.920]   that you mentally ascribe to.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.320]   So what is this good news?
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.320]   What is the euangelion of Jesus Christ?
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.760]   And allow me to briefly share,
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.520]   especially as there may be some in this room
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.320]   who have never thoroughly heard it.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.440]   The gospel of Jesus Christ does not begin
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.840]   in the first book of the New Testament
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:44.720]   in the Gospel of Matthew,
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.880]   but it actually begins in the very beginning,
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.240]   in the very first verse of the very first chapter
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.360]   of the book of Genesis.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.400]   It reads, "In the beginning,
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.720]   "God created the heavens and the earth."
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.280]   And you guys know this passage.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.360]   It's well-read.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.240]   Everyone starts there.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.040]   The gospel of Jesus Christ begins
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.680]   with a creator, God of purpose,
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.840]   a God who created everything good.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.440]   And we see in Genesis chapter one,
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.320]   the word good used after day one, two, three, four, five,
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.440]   and after day six, the word is emphasized
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.560]   as very good after everything is completed.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.120]   So God had created everything good
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.080]   and he saw all that he had created
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.560]   and he deemed it very good.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.840]   And in fact, it's not until Genesis 2.18
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.120]   where God sees the lack of man's community,
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.720]   where he uses the word not good,
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.240]   his lack of an equal to not only subdue
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.600]   but to enjoy all the good that God had created.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.000]   That's the beginning of the gospel.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.040]   So we have been created,
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.640]   and I've shared this before on multiple sermons,
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.880]   by we have been created by a good God
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.760]   to know this good God, to delight in this good God,
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.760]   and to enjoy the things created by this good God.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.080]   He did not come to burden and shackle you.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.760]   Ephesians 2.10, "For we are his workmanship,
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.200]   "created in Christ Jesus for good works,
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.280]   "which God prepared beforehand
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.080]   "so that we would walk in them."
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.720]   And before even all of this was created very good
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.440]   and before sin entered the world
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.560]   in Genesis 3 to corrupt everything,
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.360]   God had ordained an eternal purpose for your life.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.000]   He had ordained an eternal purpose for mine.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.240]   It was for the purpose of good works
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.640]   that we would walk in them.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:36.320]   And this good God has offered us a gift.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.160]   And he calls it eternal life.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.880]   And what does that entail?
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:42.840]   What does it involve?
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.520]   And we so just flippantly throw it around.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.040]   But it says in John 17.3,
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.880]   "This is eternal life that they may know you,
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.560]   "the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you have sent."
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.600]   So what is the purpose of the Christian faith?
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.040]   What is the purpose of my existence?
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.040]   What is the purpose of my life?
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.000]   Well, here it is.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.280]   You were created by God and for God
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.240]   to love God and to serve God.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.640]   I'm gonna say this again.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.160]   You were created by God and for God
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.520]   to love God and to serve God.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.440]   And that's the meta-narrative that begins in Genesis
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.800]   and ends with the ultimate glory to the creator God
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.960]   in the book of Revelation.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.320]   That is our purpose.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.400]   And the purpose of our lives is to know God
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.480]   and to make him known.
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.560]   And what a privilege that is
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.920]   that we will spend eternity growing in knowledge of this God
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.320]   and giving glory to this great God.
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.000]   So this is eternal life,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.960]   that we would know him for whom we have been created.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.280]   But there is a problem
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.960]   because there's a difficulty that you and I have,
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:48.160]   an impossibility in submitting to this purpose.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.080]   Because of sin, we are hostile to this purpose.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.080]   There is a part of us,
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.280]   even if we've been coming to church all of our lives,
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.040]   since we were in our mother's wombs,
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.960]   that remains a little bit offended by this purpose.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.480]   Because you and I were born
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.840]   with an innate hostility toward this purpose
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.640]   every human being comes into the world
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.240]   desiring not to serve God, but to be served.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.920]   Because you and I are all diseased
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.800]   and thoroughly, completely, fully, exhaustively corrupted.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.040]   Ephesians 2, 1 through 3 describes our condition
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:27.040]   and you were dead in your trespasses and sins
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.240]   in which you formerly walked
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.680]   according to the course of this world,
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.200]   according to the prince of the power of the air,
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.120]   of the spirit that is now working
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.200]   in the sons of disobedience.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:41.120]   Among them, we too, the Jews,
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.920]   all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh,
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.080]   indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.560]   and were by nature children of wrath, even as a rest.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.040]   So here's a problem of sin.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.960]   Verse one says that you were dead
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.880]   in your trespasses and sins.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.560]   And I wanna just briefly cover what is sin?
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.400]   This is a very important question
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.120]   that many like misdefine.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:06.760]   And an inaccurate definition leads to a misdiagnosis.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.160]   And with a disease, any misdiagnosis is actually fatal.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.960]   So we need to carefully see what sin really is.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.920]   So when we say sin, we naturally think of things
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:20.240]   like murder, theft, alcoholism, sexual immorality,
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.400]   embezzlement, lying, and things like that.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.920]   And those are tangible sins,
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.360]   but those are symptomatic of far deeper problems.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.840]   So sin, the Greek word is hamartia.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.480]   It basically means to miss the mark.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.600]   What was our purpose?
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.800]   We were created by God and for God to love God
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:42.080]   and to serve God, but sin means not doing that.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.080]   It means living in opposition
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.760]   and out rebellion toward this purpose.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.320]   Sin has so tainted us and our consciences
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.360]   that we are offended by this purpose.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.680]   We hate our purpose.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.160]   We do not want to submit to this purpose.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:05.240]   So murder, drug abuse, theft, lying,
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:09.160]   cheating, stealing, idolatry, all of these are sins, yes,
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.520]   but that's essentially, basically,
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.760]   these are outward byproducts of a more corrupted condition.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.520]   So we entered this world hostile for the ways of God.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:23.000]   Not one of you are exempt from this disease.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.600]   So sin at its root is living in rebellion
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.200]   to the God-word purpose for which you and I
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.320]   have been created.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.840]   But in verse three, Paul writes,
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.720]   "We too, saying that the Jews, the chosen people of God,
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.040]   "for the entirety of their history,
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.400]   "have always been fleshly and rebellious."
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.960]   So the Jews too were also the spawn, the children,
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.640]   the technon of wrath, all have sinned
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.400]   and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.680]   So what is the good news?
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.640]   There's a cure.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.440]   There's a cure.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.720]   You can be sin-free.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:09.000]   You can be restored to perfect spiritual health.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.080]   You can be restored to your purpose.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:17.320]   And it's free.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.480]   And it's easy.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.080]   If you confess with your mouth and you believe in your heart
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.920]   that Jesus Christ is Lord and that God raised him
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.960]   from the dead, you will be saved.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.840]   I wanna read Romans 10, 11 to 13 for us,
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.920]   but I wanna also read verse nine for context
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.040]   that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.200]   and believe in your heart that God raised him
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.080]   from the dead, you will be saved.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.720]   Easy as that.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.760]   For the scripture says, "Whoever believes in him
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.160]   "will not be disappointed, for there is no distinction
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.800]   "between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all,
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.360]   "and richest for all who call on him.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.760]   "Whoever will call on the name of the Lord
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.000]   "will be saved from this horrific disease."
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.360]   So what is this good news?
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.320]   First of all, all it takes is faith.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.560]   You don't have to buy anything.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.600]   You don't have to adhere to anything.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.760]   Belief in his sufficiency.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.920]   All it takes is faith that God's method of payment
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.400]   was fully and absolutely sufficient.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.000]   Second, good news.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.160]   If you place your trust in Christ,
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.880]   you will not be disappointed ever in any way,
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.160]   shape, or form because he is abounding in riches
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.720]   and in loving kindness.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.600]   Your race, your background, your sinful,
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:40.600]   shameful, ugly past, your family's dirty secrets,
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.920]   all of that, none of that matters 'cause there's a cure.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.160]   You can be sin free.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.800]   You can be restored to your original purpose.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.120]   Eternal life has availed itself to you.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:53.960]   Why?
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.880]   Because the creator of the universe has compassion.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:06.560]   He loves a sinner.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:11.760]   And this is truly the best you,
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.840]   Angelion, our ears can hear.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.680]   Which brings us to our second point.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.680]   There is a dying audience in need of good news,
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.160]   Romans 10, 14 to 15.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:29.760]   How then will they call on him
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.800]   in whom they have not believed?
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:41.320]   How will they believe in him whom they have not heard?
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.840]   And how will they hear without a preacher?
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.760]   How will they preach unless they are sent
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.160]   just as it is written?
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.600]   How beautiful are the feet of those
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.840]   who bring good news of good things.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.640]   Paul goes on to pose five rhetorical questions
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.480]   that follow a logical sequence.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.400]   The first question has a word, then, un, attached to it.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.480]   How then?
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.120]   There is such great news.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.040]   God is promising not to disappoint.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.640]   He is abounding in true and eternal riches
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.840]   and all it takes is a sincere cry for help,
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:19.600]   a call out, what a great salvation, what great news.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.800]   But they need to hear this.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:28.320]   And who are they in verses 14 and 15?
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.680]   It is those who are living in hostility
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:35.440]   toward their purpose still and hopelessly trying to cope.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.800]   Everything disappoints, everything falls short.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.440]   Religious adherence and morality are not enough.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.720]   Relative uprightness is not enough.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.600]   Religious heritage or ancestry is not enough.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.040]   My grandparents were Christian, but I don't believe this.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.720]   There is frustration.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   So some, in trying to cope, they turn to pleasure.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.800]   They turn to the promise of luxury, status, wealth, comfort.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.200]   Some turn to superstitious rituals.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:10.720]   Some, trying to attain holiness, practice asceticism,
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.680]   self-deprecation, self-denial.
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.760]   Some put all their eggs in the family basket.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.880]   Oh, only if I have a good family.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.480]   Some turn to humanitarian good deeds.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.560]   Well, if I help the poor enough,
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.000]   maybe I will be upright in the afterlife.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.960]   If there is an afterlife, I'll be okay.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:32.960]   Some hope in government, some in education,
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.880]   and none of these fixes the problem of sin.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.480]   None of these cures the disease.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.520]   One of the most common symptoms of the disease of sin
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.840]   is this belief that a change of circumstance
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.880]   will make me happy.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:54.200]   You and I know that changed circumstances
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.960]   always fall short of bringing
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.280]   any kind of lasting happiness, but we're stupid.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:04.640]   We go from one changed circumstance and disappointment,
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.800]   and we turn to another changed circumstance
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.040]   and get disappointed again.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.400]   But God says, "Whoever turns to Him
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.600]   "will never be disappointed."
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.040]   So that they, in verses 14 and 15,
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.800]   this they need to hear that there is a cure,
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.960]   that there is an answer, and that there is only one way,
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.200]   one cure, one solution, it's the message
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.400]   of the cross of Jesus Christ,
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.080]   because it is a power of salvation for all who believe,
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.720]   for the Jew and the Gentile.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.160]   So we need to preach.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.120]   Even if our message is laughable foolishness,
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.480]   and there's sin-clouded minds and hearts.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:46.600]   Let me put a few faces of the they for you
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.760]   up on the picture here.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.160]   And can you dim the lights?
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:56.240]   This picture, I took it in January 2017
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.800]   in Cebu, Philippines.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.960]   People know Cebu for mangoes,
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.720]   and for it's a very popular honeymoon destination
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.400]   in the Philippines.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.400]   But this picture is in one of the largest
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.840]   dump site villages in Cebu.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.800]   And this dump site was home to about 200 children.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.240]   So just for your reference,
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.240]   about 64 million people around the world
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.880]   work in dump sites, collecting recyclables,
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.800]   and sometimes chasing rats.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.600]   Because if you catch a rat,
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.880]   you will find someone who will eat the rat,
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.480]   and you will get paid a dollar.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.320]   So a lot of kids that I've met
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.240]   have gotten their finger bit
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.800]   and caught some kind of random disease
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.120]   pursuing these rats in these dump sites.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:47.040]   So 64 million people work in the dump sites,
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.960]   but 15 million live in the dump sites all around the world,
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.200]   and many around the hotel resort
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.800]   that you're gonna frequent.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.600]   Just 10 miles away, they live there.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.600]   Children die every day in these dump site villages
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.840]   from lead poisoning, from drinking polluted water.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.160]   When it rains, no one in this village sleeps really well
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.520]   because the water rises,
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.440]   and the people have nowhere else to go.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.440]   Sometimes if the government wants to use this land
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.320]   to build a hotel or apartment complex,
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.480]   and the people are not refusing,
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.840]   or they're not willing to go, they'll set fire.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.000]   And oftentimes up to about a third of the people
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.280]   living in this community will perish in the fire.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.960]   And you're not gonna hear about this in the news,
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.320]   because in the eyes of many national governments,
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:32.040]   these are not people with any value.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.800]   Next picture.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:39.120]   So this group that you see here
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:43.560]   is from an all boys high school from Busan, South Korea.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.280]   Only one of the boys was a churchgoer.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.400]   The rest of them were very, very pagan.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.440]   All the ladies that you see in the back are teachers.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.120]   So these boys are growing up in Korea,
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.360]   the country with one of the highest
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.120]   suicide rates in the world,
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.840]   the highest rate of alcohol consumption in the world,
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.520]   the country where sexual immorality
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.920]   is becoming more and more readily accepted.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.320]   They are growing up in a society
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.920]   full of broken families, empty promises.
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.360]   These Korean youths are living in one of the richest,
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.200]   most technologically innovative countries in the world.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:17.840]   And they have peers who kill themselves
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.040]   because they cannot keep up.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:25.560]   There's a little Filipino boy in the front.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:29.680]   These high school boys collect money
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:33.160]   to sponsor this little boy through compassion.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.040]   His name is Johnny Ray Mapait.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.840]   And this is his home.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.160]   He was born in this village.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.760]   He picks up recyclables about three hours a day, every day.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.560]   And he makes about $6 extra income
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.040]   each week to help his family.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.240]   So his family lacks many, many opportunities
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.320]   and they lack many daily necessities.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.160]   And as I shared a few minutes ago,
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.600]   there are about 64 million people who work in this
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.880]   and about 15 million people who are living in this.
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:05.520]   And these Korean youths and the people
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.240]   in Johnny Ray's community have a few things in common.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:12.840]   None of them have hope in themselves.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.440]   They are all plagued with the disease of sin and of self.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.680]   For Johnny Ray and the 13 Korean boys
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.840]   and their teachers behind them, their only hope is Christ.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.320]   And there is something interesting that I found
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.360]   when the materially rich and the materially poor,
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.720]   when they meet together, both end up reflecting
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.400]   on their spiritual poverty.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:40.880]   And they kind of, you could see in their eyes,
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.160]   it's like, we're the same.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.120]   And we have more in common than not.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.440]   All of them are the day.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:53.280]   There is need for the proclamation
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.120]   of the gospel in the Philippines.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.800]   There is need for the proclamation,
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.880]   (coughs)
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:06.480]   of the gospel here in Orange County,
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:12.520]   in Ecuador, Haiti, India, Japan, China,
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:19.160]   Africa, which is not a country, by the way,
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.000]   it's a continent.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.400]   And what is sad is that Korea has so many churches
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.000]   and doing humanitarian work in the poorest of the country
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.160]   has now become a thing for Koreans.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.480]   It's become trendy.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.080]   They take selfies with the poor.
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:43.240]   But the Korean generation is losing the generation of youth.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.600]   The physical needs of the poor may look different,
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.600]   but the spiritual needs of both the poor
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.840]   and the rich are the same.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.960]   There is no hope outside of Christ.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.040]   How then will they call on Him
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.440]   in whom they have not believed?
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.360]   How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard?
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.800]   And how will they hear without a preacher?
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:11.040]   Which brings us to our third point.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:18.320]   The divine strategy and the delivery of this good news.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.760]   However, they did not all heed the good news,
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.920]   for Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?"
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.160]   So faith comes from hearing and hearing
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.480]   by the word of Christ.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:35.120]   Restoration through faith has always come
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.840]   through the proclamation of the word of God,
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.080]   through the beautiful feet of those who bring good tidings.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.000]   And you have many people with beautiful feet
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.360]   around your lives, and praise God for that.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:50.320]   Restoration does not come through fancy gimmicks
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.360]   or ear-tickling words.
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:56.360]   It's simply through the hearing of the words of Christ.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.720]   No human strategy, effort, tactic
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.240]   can change the human heart.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:07.320]   You and I can pressure people to conform, sure,
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:10.520]   but we can't change the heart.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:16.520]   You and I cannot strategize for someone to come to faith.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.760]   In fact, the Scriptures explicitly say
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.720]   that most will not listen,
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.440]   that the darkness hates the light,
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.240]   the proud hate being humbled,
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.240]   the godless cannot but be offended
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.160]   by the truth of God's existence.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.640]   So it is not our job to save people
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.720]   or to soften their hearts.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.240]   That's not our job.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.640]   I am discovering both a powerful and a liberating truth.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:46.560]   I have no power to change the human heart.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:53.520]   I can scatter the seed, I can plant, I can water,
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:55.960]   but only God can bring the growth.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.320]   But you know what's interesting and mind-boggling?
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:03.800]   That God would use sin-tainted men like me
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.400]   to carry soul-saving good news to people.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:13.280]   I mean, donkeys get in the way less.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.640]   I don't believe them to be selfish.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.120]   And he can speak through donkeys.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.840]   You guys got to that part yet in your Bible reading plans?
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.720]   He can speak through donkeys.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:27.400]   He says he can make the rocks cry out
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.640]   and he can use the winds and the waves
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.040]   to give evidence of who he is,
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.120]   but he desires to use you and me.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:39.000]   And though he can and does use things
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.480]   like seminary training, evangelism classes,
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:45.480]   apologetics, tactics, that is not the primary means
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.040]   through which he equips his people for evangelism,
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:54.760]   there is a mission field very uniquely appointed for you.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:59.360]   There are people in your lives, at your schools,
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.800]   in your families, in your workplaces
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:05.920]   that only you can humanly reach with the gospel.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:10.120]   And God will use your day-to-day life
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.160]   as a witness and a testimony of his grace
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:13.440]   to the people around you.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.880]   Non-believers in your life
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.760]   who are trying to cope with this problem of sin
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:26.240]   are watching you who say you have hope.
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:31.240]   They're watching to see how hopeful you really are.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:35.280]   And God in his divine strategy
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.760]   gives us some wonderful gifts
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:44.400]   when he ordains trials, suffering,
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:49.440]   persecution, and pain.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:54.440]   He gives us a megaphone and a platform to share
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.680]   through those things.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:35:01.200]   In fact, you know, trial, sufferings, and persecutions
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   have always spread the gospel more quickly
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.400]   and throughout Christian history.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.200]   The early church, as they were being persecuted
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.080]   and being scattered, they evangelized the world.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.200]   Philippians 2, 14 to 15,
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.800]   "Do all things without grumbling or disputing
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.360]   "so that you will prove yourselves
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.280]   "to be blameless and innocent children of God
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.040]   "above reproach in the midst of a crooked
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.320]   "and perverse generation among whom you appear
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.240]   "as lights in the world."
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.440]   Why do you not grumble or complain?
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.960]   Because that is a natural flesh-driven response
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.320]   to difficulties.
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.520]   But as a Christian who says,
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.160]   "I believe in a God who's created everything perfect.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.200]   "He is perfectly good.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.320]   "He is a God of love.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.080]   "And even if he were to ordain something difficult
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.680]   "in my life, I will give him the worship that he is due."
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:53.680]   And as that attitude starts to exude itself in your life,
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.480]   the unbelieving world is watching,
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.680]   like sailors looking at the stars
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.480]   to kind of direct them where to go in the Mediterranean.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.840]   The unbelieving world watches your lack of faith
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.880]   or lack of complaint
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:16.400]   and causes them to be dumbfounded.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.920]   Trial, suffering, and persecution actually does much
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.440]   to clarify our thinking, to sharpen our resolve,
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.940]   and to embolden our preaching.
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.560]   So as it says in James 1 to 2,
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.200]   consider it all joy.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:38.320]   God will use difficult things in your life
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:43.800]   to save people in your life.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:52.080]   God will use your life as an example of trust,
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:57.440]   of hope, and of joy-filled worship.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:03.240]   He will not use your luxury and your comfort.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.360]   He will use your comfort and your joy
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:11.360]   as effectively as he will use discomfort and pain.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:17.160]   This reads 1 Peter 3, 15,
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.640]   "But sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts,
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.360]   "always being ready to make a defense
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.040]   "to everyone who asks you to give an account
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.640]   "for the hope that is in you,
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.840]   "yet with gentleness and respect.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.680]   "If you've met Christ, you are already well-equipped
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.960]   "for life-giving truth."
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:36.640]   If you are a Christian, a child of God,
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.280]   and you have met Christ,
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.320]   you're already thoroughly and well-equipped.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.200]   Acts 4, 12 to 13, it says,
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.800]   "There is salvation in no one else,
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.680]   "for there is no other name under heaven
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.120]   "that has been given among men
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.720]   "by which we must be saved."
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.080]   Now, they observed the confidence of Peter and John
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.240]   and understood that they were uneducated and untrained men.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.360]   They were amazed and began to recognize them
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.480]   as having been with Jesus.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.720]   A little farther down in Acts 4, verse 18,
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.760]   we see an almost uncontrollable boldness.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:09.880]   "And when they had summoned them,
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.040]   "they commanded them not to speak or teach at all
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:12.880]   "in the name of Jesus.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.000]   "But Peter and John answered and said to them,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.760]   "'Whether it is right on the side of God
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.040]   "'to give heed to you rather than to God,
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:22.040]   "'you be the judge, for we cannot stop speaking
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.240]   "'about what we have seen and heard.'"
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.520]   So what's the application here for covenant number nine?
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.600]   I wanna be very careful here.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.200]   We were discussing with the leaders,
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.440]   we wanna try to make these covenants very real
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.240]   and very practical in our lives, but nine is hard.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:40.840]   'Cause I don't wanna pressure or burden you
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.120]   to share the good news.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.840]   Evangelism that is forced
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.720]   is usually devoid of spiritual power.
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.720]   It's like a salesman trying to sell you something
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.280]   that he himself would not buy.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:58.800]   Duty and obligation is a poor fuel
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.360]   for soul-saving evangelism.
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.600]   So though we should always feel a bit burdened
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.320]   and uncomfortable when we are around non-believers
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:11.320]   whom we love, what compels us has to be the love of Christ
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.640]   and its compassion, our joy, our passion,
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.800]   and our unwavering devotion are the tools
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.560]   that we need to use to reach the non-believing world.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:26.800]   So the only application I could really give you is this.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.240]   Seek the Lord.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:35.560]   I can't twist your arm and guilt trip you
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:38.160]   into signing up for things like the Gospel Night.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:42.240]   'Cause if it's forced,
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:47.200]   the good news is not gonna be good news to you,
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.520]   it's gonna be a shackle.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:53.280]   But if you encounter God,
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:59.360]   really, deeply, truly encounter God,
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.120]   you will change.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:05.640]   It's like anything else we deem truly amazing in our lives,
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.120]   anything that is like life-altering,
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.920]   it changes us a little bit.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:15.760]   December 20th, 2005,
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:19.920]   my cousin scored two tickets to a Laker game.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.800]   It was against the Dallas Mavericks,
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.800]   and I love going to Laker games,
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.040]   but this one was really special
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:31.000]   because he got us tickets 12 rows behind the Laker bench.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.800]   12 rows behind the Laker bench affords you this.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.440]   You can hear them cuss.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:42.760]   You can see them joking around.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.680]   There was a player named Kwame Brown
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.080]   who had a little bit of a cut,
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.640]   so he got blood on his jersey.
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.360]   The trainer at the time, Gary Vitti,
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.600]   sprayed the blood off his jersey
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.240]   and then sprayed him in the face,
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:54.160]   laughed at him.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.720]   Kwame Brown went, "What?
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:58.160]   "I was close enough to see all this."
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.080]   I like to believe that I looked at Kobe in the eye,
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.080]   I waved hello, and he just stared back.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:09.360]   At halftime, he had 32 points,
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.320]   and at that time, he had only scored 50 points in a game
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.720]   five times, 26 for the whole career,
[00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.760]   but at that point, only five times.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.280]   So my cousin and I at halftime,
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:19.840]   as we were picking up our hot dogs,
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.040]   we were very excited.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.600]   Like, dude, what if he gets 50?
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.680]   In the third quarter, he scored 30 points.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.360]   So that was a 62-point game.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.240]   Best game he had ever had until
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.680]   a few minutes later, he had 81.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:35.040]   But at that time, we were so excited.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.560]   Pastor Aaron was texting me,
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.480]   "I hate you right now."
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:43.080]   We were just, and I could not wait to tell everyone
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.440]   and their mamas what I had just witnessed.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.520]   I had just witnessed history being made.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.800]   I zang-ed it, 'cause it was before Facebook.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.080]   I put pictures up there.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:57.600]   I even show people half of the streamer that I got,
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.200]   'cause my cousin, we only got one,
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.400]   so he ripped it in half.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.600]   I wanted to tell everybody,
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:07.040]   because I just witnessed history being made,
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:11.520]   and me, this news is uncontrollable and uncontainable.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.440]   I had to get it out.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.640]   And that's just basketball.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:19.040]   When I got engaged, she said yes,
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.120]   even though I knew she was gonna say yes.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:22.840]   I had to tell the world.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.960]   After eight years of not having babies,
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.880]   two appeared, we're pregnant,
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:30.680]   born a girl, twins, oh!
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:34.240]   We could not.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.800]   Well, we had to wait until the second trimester,
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:39.840]   but I was just like, "Mmm, you know what?"
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:43.840]   Because when something so life-changing,
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:47.160]   beautiful, and sweet happens in your life,
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.640]   you don't need training to talk about that stuff.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.160]   It happens.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.800]   The problem is not whether or not
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.720]   you know how to give answers to everything.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:02.720]   The problem is the gospel is often just news.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:06.280]   That's what we need to fix before we commit to anything.
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.680]   So number nine is very tricky for me
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:10.560]   to try to give you an application for.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:20.440]   When the why is clear,
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:24.880]   the how is super easy.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:32.560]   When the why is clear,
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:36.600]   you figure out the how as you go.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:40.840]   But when the why is not clear,
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.680]   you drag your feet through every step
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.840]   of the what and the how.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.120]   And the when.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:50.920]   The application for covenant number nine
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.320]   is for you and me to figure out
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:57.760]   is the good news of Jesus Christ information,
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:01.960]   or is it life-altering, soul-saving,
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:05.720]   good, sweet, wonderful news?
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:09.680]   So I'm gonna give you two applications, though,
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.400]   so that you don't get in the way
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.360]   of God doing his salvific work.
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.720]   1 Timothy 4, 16,
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:20.240]   pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:23.280]   NIV says watch your life and doctrine closely.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.720]   I like that better, actually.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:28.280]   And do this not just for a week,
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:29.800]   not just for a month, not for a year,
[00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.520]   but persevere.
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.960]   For as you do this,
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:39.360]   you will ensure salvation both for yourself
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.520]   and those who hear you.
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:44.120]   (audience member coughing)
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.600]   Are you growing
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:52.080]   in your ability to teach life-giving words?
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.160]   Are you paying attention?
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:56.880]   Are you scrutinizing your heart?
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.800]   Are you being holy as he has called you to be holy,
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.040]   or do you quickly discount that as legalism?
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:07.480]   You want those around you to be saved?
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.960]   Live like you believe that the gospel of Jesus Christ
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.520]   is good news in front of those you want to be saved.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:22.400]   But like I shared with you, I have no salvific power.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.000]   I could do nothing to change someone's heart,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.240]   and Jesus has said that already.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:31.720]   And we're gonna look at one last passage before I close.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.920]   John 15, four to five, abide in me,
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.000]   and I in you.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   And I in you
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:45.320]   as a branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:48.160]   unless it abides in the vine.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:52.440]   So neither can you unless you abide in me.
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:57.960]   I am the vine, you are the branches.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.840]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.160]   he bears much fruit.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.920]   I am the vine, you are the branches.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.840]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.240]   he bears much fruit.
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.920]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.320]   he bears much fruit.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.920]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.160]   he bears much fruit.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.920]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:23.160]   he bears much fruit.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.920]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.160]   he bears much fruit.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.920]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.160]   he bears much fruit.
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.920]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:35.160]   he bears much fruit.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:38.160]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.160]   he bears much fruit.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:42.160]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.160]   he bears much fruit.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.160]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:47.160]   he bears much fruit.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:50.160]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.160]   he bears much fruit.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:54.160]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.160]   he bears much fruit.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:58.160]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:46:59.160]   he bears much fruit.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:02.160]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.160]   he bears much fruit.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:07.160]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.160]   he bears much fruit.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.160]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.160]   he bears much fruit.
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:17.160]   He who abides in me and I in him,
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.160]   he bears much fruit.
