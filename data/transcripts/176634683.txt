[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you again for this evening.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.560]   We pray, Lord God, that you give us teachable hearts, help us, Lord God, to be eager not
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.280]   only to learn, but to glean and to know the heart of Christ and what you have been doing
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.080]   all through these years, Lord God, and the prophecies that you've made and how all of
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.600]   these things, one by one, are being fulfilled and will be fulfilled one day.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.320]   I pray that you would grip our minds and our hearts, that as a community, Lord, that we
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.040]   would learn to praise you and honor you, that we would have more of you in us than the effects
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.280]   of the world.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.800]   We pray, Father, that you would bless our time together, just asking for your grace.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.240]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:01:05.480]   All right, so we're looking at chapter 58 and 59 today.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:12.000]   So chapter 58, the first question that was asked is, what is God calling the prophet
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.560]   to do in verse 1?
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.320]   So the first thing that we see is, if you look at chapter 58, verse 1, "Cry aloud, do
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.680]   not hold back, lift up your voice like a trumpet, declare to my people their transgression,
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.720]   to the house of Jacob their sins."
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.560]   In the previous chapter, in chapter 57, who was being rebuked?
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.160]   Flip your Bible back to chapter 57.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.760]   Who was being rebuked?
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.200]   Who was being rebuked in chapter 57?
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.360]   The leaders of Israel, right?
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.360]   And what were they called?
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.360]   What were they called to do?
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.360]   What are they called?
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.360]   Watchmen, right?
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.280]   And what was the primary duty of the watchmen?
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.640]   To give warning, to protect.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.280]   So remember one of the descriptions that they give in chapter 57 is that they're like
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.080]   dogs but then they can't bark, right?
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.080]   They don't warn.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.360]   So if we look at chapter 58, it's a continuation of that in 58, where what the leaders of Israel
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.000]   were not doing, God is calling the prophet Isaiah to first and foremost to declare where
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.960]   they stand before God, right?
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.320]   To call them out in their sins because until they recognize where they stand before God,
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.360]   all the religious things that they're doing doesn't matter.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.960]   This is probably the most dangerous position that any human being and even Christians can
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.000]   be in, to think that you have salvation when you don't.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.040]   Or even as Christians to think that somehow, you know, our primary concern is what can
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.520]   I do to glorify God or what is God's will for my life?
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.520]   And then when you come before God, the primary thing that God's calling you to do is repent,
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.600]   right?
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.100]   So if we don't know where we stand before God, then every religious thing that we're
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.440]   doing in the end is meaningless.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.560]   So the first thing that God calls Isaiah to do is to call them out in their sins, to declare
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.200]   to them their transgressions, to reveal their sins, right?
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.640]   What was the primary problem that he's telling Isaiah to call out?
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.120]   Again, they didn't know where they stood before God.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.160]   He said they were delighting to know his ways.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.640]   So on the surface, it seems like they were right with God.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.240]   There's a lot of sacrifices going on, a lot of superficial religiousness.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.880]   And yet, God calls Isaiah to tell them about their sin.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.560]   What does it mean they forsook judgment of God in verse 2?
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.480]   How did you understand that when he said they, you know, they were delighting in the knowledge
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.720]   of God, right, and then they were forsaking the judgment of God?
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.160]   What does that mean?
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.680]   How did you understand that when you read that?
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:16.280]   >> Kind of like universal, like God loves everybody.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.040]   He's not just like, we're just human people.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.160]   >> So they didn't understand that God was angry with them?
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.440]   >> Or that like God, why would that punish them?
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.600]   They didn't understand the judgment of God.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.760]   Anybody else?
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.880]   God is bringing judgment and they don't realize that God is bringing judgment because of their
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.200]   sins, right?
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.440]   They think, they think they, because they think they're standing in right with God.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.960]   So when all of these things are happening, it has nothing to do with them because they
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.920]   don't recognize the judgment of God.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:57.120]   I mean, I think this is something that, you know, one of the most sobering passages in
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.520]   the scripture, not just this, but all the passages in the Old Testament where religiousness
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.880]   in Israel was extremely heavy, a lot of sacrifices, a lot of worship, a lot of, you know, gathering
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.200]   together, and yet when God shows up, God is angry with them.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.440]   God is not happy with them, right?
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.800]   Does that describe what it was like when Jesus came?
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.280]   Yeah, a lot of, a lot of temple worship, a lot of temple activity, right?
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.880]   Every time Passover came, hundreds and thousands of people flocked to Jerusalem, and yet when
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.720]   Jesus comes, Jesus didn't come to praise them.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.920]   His primary word that he had for the nation of Israel was rebuke, right?
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.440]   Their repentance wasn't genuine.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.440]   It was all superficial.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.880]   And so that's the period that Israel is in right now, right?
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.600]   God is bringing judgment upon them, but they don't recognize this as God's discipline because
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.960]   they're at the temple doing a lot of religious things, right?
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.040]   So that's what, first and foremost, before he brings restoration, they need to recognize
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.820]   what they need restoration from.
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:05.760]   And the primary thing that they need restoration from was from their own sins.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.920]   And so that's why chapter 58, 57 ends with the watchman, basically the leaders of Israel
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.120]   are not doing their job.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.700]   They're not warning the people.
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.480]   And then he sends a true prophet, Isaiah, saying, "Go, warn these people about their
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.480]   sins."
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.620]   They're, on the surface, they look like very righteous people, but in reality, when they
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.280]   stand before God, they're under God's condemnation, right?
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.380]   Why didn't God answer their prayers?
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.320]   Because they were seeking for their own pleasure.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.880]   Somebody turn to James 4, 2, and 3.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.340]   If I say somebody, no one's going to turn.
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.340]   Whoever's there first, can you read it out loud?
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.340]   "You desire to have the lust of your murder.
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.340]   You covet and cannot obtain, so you find quarrel.
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.340]   You do not have because you do not ask.
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.340]   You ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly.
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.340]   You spend it on your passions."
[00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.340]   Doesn't that sound, doesn't that passage sound exactly like that?
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:07:14.820]   He says you're praying, but then God doesn't answer because you're constantly quarreling,
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.460]   you're frustrated, you do not have because you do not ask, but when you do ask, you don't
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.780]   get it because you're asking for your own pleasure, right?
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.220]   Sounds exactly like this passage.
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:31.660]   I'm pretty sure James knew this passage when he was writing that passage, right?
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.780]   This was the condition of Israel.
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.460]   It wasn't because they weren't praying, right?
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.260]   It was because they had sin, right?
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.700]   It wasn't because they weren't at the worship, it wasn't because they weren't active in religious
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.700]   activities.
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.180]   They were doing all of that stuff and yet their hearts were filled with sin and they
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.380]   kept on coming to God wondering how come God doesn't answer our prayer?
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.620]   And so this is his answer, right?
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.700]   We say that all the time like, "Oh, you know, God always answers prayers."
[00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.300]   No, God doesn't answer all prayers.
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:07.020]   He clearly says, He does not answer this prayer because your prayers, the content of your
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.780]   prayers itself is selfish.
[00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.420]   Like there's not a holy vending machine that if you do some righteous stuff that God will
[00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.980]   answer all your prayers.
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.900]   Remember there's a condition to prayer, right?
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.580]   What is the condition to prayer?
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:27.980]   If you abide in me, in my words abide in you, then ask whatever you wish and it shall be
[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:28.980]   done for you.
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.260]   So there's condition to prayer.
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.820]   Prayer is not coming to a genie and saying like if you did enough righteous things at
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.580]   church and gave enough and prayed enough and did enough that somehow you're going to come
[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.780]   to God and that God's going to answer whatever you want, right?
[00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.500]   Even the content of your prayer has to be within the will of God.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.500]   And so that's what he's saying.
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.740]   It's like, again, it's not because they didn't pray.
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.820]   In fact, they said they love to delight to know God.
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.220]   They were constantly seeking Him.
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.980]   They were constantly praying.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.860]   In fact, what is the rebuke in this passage?
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.700]   They were even fasting, right?
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.020]   It wasn't even just casual prayer.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:10.020]   They were constantly fasting, but God says your fast is meaningless.
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:19.060]   So even fasting, even forsaking food and going hungry to seek God, this intense prayer, even
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.780]   that he says in God's eyes is useless because they have no idea where they stand before
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:23.780]   God right now.
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:28.460]   And that's what God is calling Isaiah to show them.
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:33.300]   Before revival can come, before the Lord's blessing or shalom can come, you have to deal
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.300]   with your sin.
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.780]   Sin that is swept under the rug is never really swept under the rug because God's under the
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.180]   rug too, right?
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:45.500]   There's nowhere you can go as long as sin is sin, right?
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:50.540]   Fervent prayer, sacrifice, giving all of that doesn't make up for the sin that God calls
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.900]   us to repent.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:56.780]   And that's what he's trying to do first and foremost.
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:03.620]   Says they were constantly coming and they were trusting in empty rituals.
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:08.940]   So again, the historical period right before the judgment comes upon Israel, the Syrians
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:15.820]   and the Babylonians, during that period, Israel was independent, especially the Southern kingdom.
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.860]   You know, they, they had some good Kings.
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.660]   They had a lot of bad King, but they had some good Kings.
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:25.820]   And so there was a lot of sacrifices, a lot of temple activity.
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:31.260]   So in their mind, they were thinking, well, I mean, think about it in modern terms, right?
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.820]   I'm active at church, which is what they did.
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:41.340]   I do my quiet time, which would be the equivalent to them praying, right?
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:47.780]   I think religious activity wise, they're probably more fervent than most people today.
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.580]   We would probably consider them super Christians, right?
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.620]   At least from on the surface.
[00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.540]   And yet when they come before God, he said, the primary thing that God's concerned about
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:04.500]   is not you going out and doing work for God is repentance, right?
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:09.900]   So again, this sounds a lot like what Jesus says to, to the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.580]   and the Jews when he came.
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.900]   And this is probably one of the most deceptive things because when we are busy doing God's
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.820]   work, where it is on the surface, that's when we feel the safest, but then that's when we're
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.420]   also the most frustrated.
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.500]   At least if you're not a Christian or you're backsliding, you know exactly where you stand
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.500]   before God.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:36.420]   That you feel distant from God and you know why, right?
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.400]   Because you know your sins.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.860]   You know that there's things that you need to repent of, right?
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.620]   But people who are religious, who are not right with God, are the most frustrated because
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.940]   a lot of times we're the ones who are blind.
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.140]   And we're asking the same question that Israel's asking.
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.020]   How come God doesn't answer my prayer?
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:57.020]   How come he feels so distant?
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.820]   How come my relationship with God seems so mechanical?
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:07.580]   And we keep asking, well, I'm doing, I'm trying so hard and yet at the core of where they
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:15.380]   stand before God, God says, no, until you repent, there is no answer prayer, right?
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:20.300]   So this is at the core of Israel's sin right here.
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.780]   What's the kind of fast that he, he seeks?
[00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:29.860]   Again, just, just these religious rituals that God doesn't consider that in and of
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:30.860]   itself fast.
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:35.460]   It's that God desires for the fasting to be to lose the bonds of the wicked, to undo
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:41.380]   the straps of the yoke, to set free those who are oppressed, to share bread with those
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:50.180]   who are hungry, to offer shelter to the homeless, to call the naked and on and on and on.
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:54.420]   To care for the family, their flesh.
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:13:01.060]   In other words, what he is saying is if you're going to come before God and ask and, and
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:05.020]   to seek him, you have to care about the things that God cares about.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.020]   Right?
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:10.500]   So if you look at all of these things, he's not simply saying that if you, if you read
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:15.900]   through all the prophets in Israel's history, God has a special place for those who are
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:16.900]   broken.
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:24.180]   And again, I always think about this as a, as a dad of, you know, several kids.
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:29.060]   And if my kids ask me like what I want, I mean, I have a lot of superficial things,
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:34.220]   obviously I want, but if there's, I know what my kids can get, like what I really want,
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.700]   they can't afford, right?
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.700]   For myself.
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:45.100]   But I think any parent would say, if my oldest son asked me what I desire, my immediate answer
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:49.980]   would be take better care of your siblings, right?
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:56.700]   Take better care of your daughter or your, not daughter, your sister, right?
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:01.740]   Your sister and your siblings, like that would be, because if he takes better care of them,
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.100]   it would make my life easier.
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.100]   I would have less concern.
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.900]   I would have less burden, less anxiety.
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.580]   So if you look at all of these things, he said, you're coming and asking for selfish
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:15.580]   things, but if you really want me to listen, he said, this is the true fast.
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:19.500]   This is what I want you to long for because every one of these things are things that
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:24.820]   are on his heart, right?
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:29.620]   This is consistent with what he says, like, if my words abide in you, right?
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.940]   If you abide in me, my words abide in you, then ask whatever you wish, because this is
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.940]   his word, right?
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.740]   And this is his heart and this is his will.
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:47.700]   So that's what he's saying, make your fast about him and not you, right?
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:54.580]   Listen to these five things that God promises if you fast the way God desires to fast, right?
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.180]   Results of true fasting.
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.620]   Light will break through the dawn.
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:05.180]   What is that in reference to when the light breaks through the dawn?
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:10.020]   What kind of image do you get?
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:16.420]   It's not dark anymore.
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:23.780]   Yes, that's what I was looking for.
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:27.860]   The picture that we get is like the nation of Israel under this cloud, right?
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.860]   And they're not able to see.
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.780]   And exactly, I mean, in simple terms, it's from darkness to light, right?
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.460]   When God shows up and he makes things clear, right?
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:41.340]   Physically and spiritually, psychologically, things become clear when God shows up.
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.060]   And that's the imagery, right?
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.820]   In other words, when you fast the way that God desires you to fast, when you seek me
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:52.140]   the way I desire for you to seek me, when God shows up, right, the light gets turned
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:56.580]   on.
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:59.200]   Healing shall spring up speedily.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.020]   Your righteousness shall go before you.
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.020]   Think about it.
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:10.300]   When you're frustrated in righteousness because you're not right with God, how hard you have
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.140]   to work to declare your righteousness.
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:18.940]   But when you're right with God, it's almost like God goes before you and bears fruit.
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.500]   Does that make sense?
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:28.060]   You know, like a church trying so hard to bear fruit when we're not righteous internally.
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:32.380]   And all we get is the more people you attract to church, the more people who don't like
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.420]   church, right?
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:39.340]   The more people you bring to church, more of them leave saying that this is filled with
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:43.180]   self-righteous hypocrites, right?
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.420]   So even the way that God designed us to bear fruit, what is the first thing he tells us
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.420]   to do?
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.300]   Abide in me.
[00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.080]   You can't bear fruit if you do not abide in me.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.820]   This works as a church and individually.
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:59.980]   I mean, think about the things that you're praying about.
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.500]   I mean, it may be godly prayer.
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.900]   Maybe what God desires for you.
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:08.540]   Maybe salvation of a family member or a friend or co-worker.
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:13.740]   You know, no matter how hard you work and how articulate you are and how many great
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:22.700]   books that you give to them, if you're not abiding in Christ, you're trying to reproduce
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.380]   and you're trying to bear righteousness on your own.
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.500]   You just, we just aren't going to be successful.
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.100]   Here it says when God shows up, the light gets turned on, right?
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:34.700]   There's health and then righteousness goes before you, right?
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:35.700]   You're not forcing it.
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.500]   He said it goes before you.
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.060]   The Lord will protect you.
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.180]   The Lord will answer them.
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:46.680]   I mean, this is probably the biggest benefit of being right with God, that our prayers
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.160]   are not frustrated.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.140]   The greatest benefit of being a Christian is we have a direct access to our father,
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.180]   the creator of the universe.
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.980]   So to have our prayers frustrated is probably the most frustrating thing.
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.620]   It's like having a million dollars in the bank account and not being able to access
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.620]   it.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.620]   You're going hungry.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:10.300]   You need to pay your bills and you know you have the money, but you can't access it.
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.300]   You don't have the code.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:16.460]   And so for a Christian, the greatest asset that we have is that we are able to enter
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.860]   the throne of grace and call him our Abba father.
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:23.640]   But when we have superficial relationship with God, it's just religiousness.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.020]   And yet we're just harboring all kinds of sins hidden in our hearts.
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.700]   And he says, then our prayers are frustrated.
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.740]   Our fasting is useless.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.540]   And in the end, everything that we do, we try to do with all our might.
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:37.100]   And in the end, you just get frustrated, right?
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.980]   God will answer our prayers.
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.340]   The Lord is the one who will guide them.
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:48.260]   Again, how often are we frustrated because we're looking for the Lord's will?
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:54.240]   You know, I think the most important aspect of finding the Lord's will is to be in the
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.120]   Lord's will.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.720]   To be in the Lord's will.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.520]   If you're in the Lord's will on a daily basis, the Lord's will become more and more clear
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.520]   to you.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.360]   But if you're not living in the Lord's will on a day to day basis, to try to figure out
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:14.000]   what the Lord's will while you are outside the Lord's will, it's impossible, right?
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.620]   The Lord's will was never meant to be accessed from outside of his will.
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.820]   If that makes any sense.
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.380]   You have to be in the house of God, in your personal relationship with God.
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:29.100]   And if you're not there, and then you're looking from the outside and asking for the Lord's
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.300]   will, you're just going to be frustrated, right?
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:38.660]   So all of these things, when the light breaks through, all of these things happen.
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:45.980]   Even in scorched land, he said, you will be satisfied.
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:51.100]   So in other words, our satisfaction is not going to come by circumstance.
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.260]   By fixing this and adjusting that and changing that.
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.240]   It's like, that's not where satisfaction comes.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:03.620]   Even in a dry land, when everything else is being dried up and dying, he said, you will
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.620]   be satisfied.
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:10.700]   He said, you will make their bones strong.
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.300]   Ancient ruins will be built.
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:19.460]   In other words, what was lost will be reestablished when the Lord shows up.
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.660]   And this is all a picture of revival.
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:28.380]   All of these things are what happens when true revival breaks out.
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:34.220]   And what is the catalyst for this revival?
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.220]   True fasting, right?
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.660]   What are some other ways we can put that?
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.380]   What is the catalyst for true fasting?
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.100]   What's another way we can put it?
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.020]   Repentance, right?
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.020]   Getting right with God.
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:55.620]   And all of these are same things, but basically getting right with God when God shows up.
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:00.100]   But God is not going to show up when there's unrepentant sin.
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:04.820]   God doesn't just show up where everybody is just kind of hiding their sin, you know,
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.020]   and pretending to be okay.
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.100]   Right?
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.460]   So God shows up when people are ready to repent.
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:18.180]   The only way that, again, justification causes us to have a, restore the relationship with
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.180]   God.
[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.180]   Right?
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.180]   Justification happens when we repent.
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.740]   Revival happens also when we repent.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:25.740]   Sanctification.
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:32.140]   Sanctification is a constant process of recognizing sins internally, externally, sins of commission
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.780]   and omission.
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:37.860]   When these things are being repented of, that's when revival breaks out.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.260]   Right?
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:44.340]   And ultimately they will delight in the Lord and they will be fed.
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:51.500]   Kind of remind you of Psalm chapter 1, right?
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.580]   He blesses the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:59.220]   of sinners, seeking to seek the mockers, but it is delight in the law of the Lord.
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.860]   And on his law, he meditates day and night.
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:01.860]   Right?
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.580]   He's like a tree planted by the streams of water.
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:04.580]   Right?
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:09.620]   And it basically describes this tree that's planted by the rivers of water and it is always
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.620]   being fed.
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.340]   And as a result of always being fed, his leaf is always green.
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.940]   And in due time it bears fruit.
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:17.940]   Right?
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.580]   And so what did the tree do to bear fruit?
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:25.940]   They planted by the water.
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.900]   You just need to stay by the water.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.180]   Right?
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:32.740]   And that's, that's what he's telling Israel to do.
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:37.180]   You've drifted away from me and you're trying so hard with all these religious things that
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:42.060]   somehow if you do more religious things that you can somehow bend God to bless you.
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:46.580]   But God always desires to bless them, but he's not going to bless them when there's
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.540]   unrepentant sin.
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:49.540]   Right?
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:56.980]   So again, this is, all of this is a picture of revival.
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:03.580]   You know, if you notice in chapter 58, verse 8 begins with promise of light.
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:04.580]   Right?
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:09.020]   Then your light break forth like the dawn.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:13.940]   And then verse 10, again, with the light breaking forth.
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.580]   It's almost like verse 8 is talking about God's light breaking forth.
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:23.660]   And then verse 10 says, when, when the light breaks forth and you're being revived and
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:27.420]   your delight is in the Lord and you're being satisfied and you're being fed and it said
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.940]   you will ultimately be a light in the darkness.
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.900]   Right?
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.300]   So if you're not in the light, you can't be the light.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:40.820]   You won't be effective being in the light.
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.200]   You can't be the light by being articulate.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.720]   You can't be the light by being smart.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:50.700]   You can't be a light in the world by having a lot of experience.
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:55.000]   The only way that you can be in, you can be a light to the world is by being in the light,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:07.660]   the true light of God himself.
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:13.400]   Chapter 59, it begins, it says, behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.880]   save or his ears dull that it cannot hear.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:22.440]   Clearly he says, God is willing and he is able.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.880]   Let's take a minute to think about that.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.040]   He says, God is willing and he is able.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.040]   We know he is able.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.520]   A lot of times we struggle with, is he willing?
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:35.760]   Well, he says he's, he is willing and he is able.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:40.000]   He's the one who's constantly calling his people to come to him.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.360]   He's the one, he's the one who's pursuing us.
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.840]   He's not like he's pursues us and then when he looks like we're going to pursue him, he
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.400]   turns around and he hides.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.560]   And sometimes we think that somehow that's the reason why we're frustrated.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:57.560]   Like he calls us and we try to go and then we can't find him.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.440]   Here it says it's not because he is not able.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.840]   It's not because he's not willing.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:19.000]   It says because of our sins, that God's face is hidden from us.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.080]   What are five things that mark a rebellious person according to this text?
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:28.320]   Their hands are defiled by blood.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:33.080]   They speak lies and mutter wickedness.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.840]   They seek dishonest gain.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:42.320]   The reason why I highlighted this is, this is probably the reason behind all of this.
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.520]   Seeking selfish gain, right?
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:50.080]   And he said the reason why God doesn't answer prayers is because your prayers are self-centered
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.080]   and self-seeking.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.680]   Why, why would they have blood in their hands?
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.480]   Because they're trying to profit.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.280]   They're willing to kill to make money for their own profit.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.960]   Why are they telling the wickedness?
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.160]   For their own profit.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:09.080]   Their feet run to evil.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.880]   Their throats are filled with iniquity.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.980]   And so if you look at the totality of what he's saying here, he's saying in every way
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.840]   they become corrupt.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.440]   Their hands, tongue, feet, thoughts.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.240]   You know when the Bible says love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.140]   strength like every part of who you are to love God.
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:31.240]   So this is a description of a person who is thoroughly corrupt.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.040]   That is not just with his mind, his hands, his tongue, his feet, his thought, in every
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.040]   way, right?
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:44.800]   He has turned away from the Lord.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:56.120]   So he calls Israel to repentance and he calls them to justice and righteousness.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:02.040]   And so if you seek justice and righteousness while there is injustice in you and unrighteousness
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:07.920]   in you, he describes in verses 9 through 14 what seeking and pursuing righteousness while
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.880]   there's injustice and unrighteousness in us, what the experience would be for that sinner.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:20.900]   He said they'll seek light but they're going to find darkness.
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.720]   I hope that throughout the week you guys really saw it because I think there's a lot of deep
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:30.440]   application to every one of these things.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.000]   Think about that.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.880]   That even in the pursuit of righteousness when there's unrighteousness in you, the end
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.920]   result is going to be greater darkness.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:49.000]   Again, you know, I encourage you guys to take some time to really meditate and think what
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.140]   that looks like.
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:59.200]   They desire brightness but there was constant gloom.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:05.260]   Gloom to me represents opposite of joy, right?
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:13.000]   They're seeking, they're desiring joy but they're getting exactly the opposite.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.140]   Because they're blind, they're groping around in the dark, they can never know for sure.
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:24.120]   You can read the Bible from morning till night and not understand the will of the Lord.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:28.600]   Remember what the scripture says?
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.200]   The word of God is spiritually discerned.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:38.360]   It's not simply by study, it's not just academics.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:42.000]   The will of God is not just something that you can know by studying and listening to
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.960]   a sermon.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.720]   If there's unrepentant heart, you can hear the same sermon and not understand at all
[00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.400]   his heart, what his desire is.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:55.200]   He said that's why, again, an unrighteous person seeking righteousness, at the end,
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.280]   he doesn't gain more light.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.840]   It's like a blind man groping around trying to figure things out but he'll never figure
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:08.320]   it out because he can't see.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.320]   They will lose their vigor and be like dead men.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:17.680]   The very thing that's supposed to give them strength is sucking the life out of them.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:23.640]   And I'm sure every single one of us has experienced that to a certain degree.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:31.400]   That when you're passionate for God, you can come clean the church, serve the church, snacks,
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.840]   you know, fellowship and every part of this gives you strength.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.080]   But for whatever the reason, when you're not walking right with God, the very same things
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:43.400]   that would give you strength sucks the life out of you.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.080]   Coming to church sucks the life out of you.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:51.840]   Serving other people, the idea of talking to other people sucks the life out of you.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.600]   You don't know what I'm talking about?
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.040]   I hope you never do.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:02.560]   I think some of us do.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:06.000]   You know that picture, it took me a while to figure out exactly what he was saying.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.160]   He's saying, you know, they roar like bears and they mourn like the doves.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.800]   And he says in the end it does no good.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.120]   They have no strength in themselves.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:22.600]   They can fight fiercely like a bear and they can be gentle like a dove.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.200]   But in the end, by their own strength, it does nothing.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.720]   All it is is a technique.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.320]   There's no power in the bear and there's no power in the dove.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.640]   So in the end, whether you are introverted or extroverted, whether you're a type A personality
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:42.440]   or B or C or D, whatever personality that you may have, he says all of that stuff is
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.440]   just roaring.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.440]   It's just noise.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:55.880]   In the end, it accomplishes nothing.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:01.080]   So one of the questions that I asked, why would someone who departs from evil make himself
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.560]   a prey at the end of verse 15, 59, right?
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:12.160]   How did you guys answer that?
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.640]   What is that a picture of when they say that?
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.360]   Okay, persecution.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.840]   So what is that?
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.840]   Definitely it's persecution.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.840]   But what is that a picture of?
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.760]   How is that an indictment against Israel?
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.760]   Okay.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.760]   All right.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:44.500]   It's a description of just how corrupt Israel has become.
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:48.920]   That the righteous are the ones being persecuted by the people of God.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.920]   Right?
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:52.560]   Do you become a prey by being righteous?
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.400]   That's how thoroughly Israel has drifted away from God.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.400]   Right?
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.160]   I mean, you can see that in various periods of Israel's history.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.440]   You can see that in various periods of church history.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.720]   And you can kind of see it even in our generation.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:12.120]   When you, when a church begins to drift away from God, the one who stands up for righteousness,
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.920]   those are the ones who get targeted.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.720]   Jesus freak.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.340]   Right?
[00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:23.600]   And I think where that is the most prominent is in a very nominal Christian culture, which
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.080]   in my opinion is Orange County.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.200]   It's not only Orange County, but my experience.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:34.080]   And again, this is not, you know, this is not specifically and because I'm a part of
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:39.160]   Orange County Christianity myself, but you know, I've had opportunities to visit churches
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:43.000]   from various places all in the United States.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.120]   And I can tell you, there's only two other places that I visited that is equally complacent
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.160]   or worse.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.440]   Guess what?
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.440]   Canada was one of them.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.440]   If anybody's from Canada, don't be offended.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.480]   That was one place I came back, man.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.480]   These people are so complacent.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:04.560]   And the only other place that I saw, and I, this other place I didn't see up close.
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.560]   I just judged them from afar.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:12.840]   Hawaii, Hawaii, just too laid back for, for anything.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:17.840]   And then the third most difficult place I would say is Southern California.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.000]   I won't say Northern California.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   I say Southern California.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.800]   And when I say Southern California, I'm specifically talking about Orange County.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.520]   Because I think LA is different.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:35.520]   I got saved in LA and I, you know, what's it?
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.520]   What is it?
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.920]   Anyway, this spiritual environment in LA is a little bit different.
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.040]   It's a little bit more like NorCal.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.320]   Either you are or you're not.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.240]   So if you're not, you know, you're gangster.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:52.640]   And then if you are, it tends to kind of, because the environment is a little bit more
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.640]   harsher.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:34:00.240]   But Orange County is like, you're not, you're not like full on and you're not that bad either.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.920]   You're kind of right in the middle, you know?
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:09.040]   And so nominal Christianity is a norm in Orange County.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.040]   You can disagree with me.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.880]   I'm just telling you my opinion, my observation.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:17.920]   And I think one of the hardest places to be sober and passionate for God is Orange County.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:21.960]   You know, the Orange County has a reputation of being very, very conservative.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:27.080]   And we are surrounded by mega churches and almost maybe 50, 60, 70% of the people that
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:32.560]   you may run into, you know, maybe going to church, even if it's not every week, just
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.280]   nominally just going back and forth.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.680]   So to be a nominal Christian is very easy.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.960]   To go to church in Orange County is very easy, right?
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:47.280]   But to be passionate for God in Orange County is very, very difficult.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.960]   Because you stand out.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:55.560]   I think it's harder to go against nominal Christianity than non-Christians.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.880]   That's my opinion, right?
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.760]   Because you're not being persecuted by non-Christian.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:05.320]   When you get persecuted by non-Christian, you almost feel like, you know, emboldened.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.200]   Yes, I stand right with God.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:13.680]   But when that comes in nominal Christianity, sometimes within the church, you know, that's
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.760]   something really hard to swallow, right?
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.240]   But that's where you and I are.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.960]   And again, I'm saying this because I'm a part of this myself.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.920]   So this is a place where we need to be more sober.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:30.280]   You need to be more sober here than you are in my opinion, than NorCal, right?
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.920]   Because you kind of know where the lines are in NorCal.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:37.280]   You kind of know where the lines are in LA, kind of, right?
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.720]   Orange County, it's very difficult to find the line.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:45.240]   Where is that line where God says you're right and you're wrong, right?
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:50.800]   Where is that line between God comforting struggling sinners versus rebuking rebellious
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.800]   sinners?
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:56.800]   It's very difficult to find that line.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.400]   This is where Israel was, right?
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:08.080]   It's very difficult to figure out who are the true prophets and who are not.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:18.240]   So who is Dehi?
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.240]   I think that's pretty obvious.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:23.080]   He's the Messiah to come, the one anointed, right?
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.040]   The only answer to all of this is the Messiah himself.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:33.580]   There's only one Redeemer and everything that God's been doing was for this purpose.
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:46.480]   And his coming describes him in verse 17 as a mighty warrior.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:51.040]   He's coming for battle.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.280]   He's coming with garments of vengeance.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:57.280]   The Lord will avenge.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.880]   And he will also come to redeem.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:04.440]   So if you see his first coming, you know, he didn't come as a mighty warrior.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.560]   He didn't come to avenge necessarily, but you see him at the end times in the book of
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:14.120]   Revelation when he comes, this is exactly how he's described, how Jesus is described
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:18.080]   in his second coming.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:24.840]   Where his first coming, he comes to deal with sin, to give opportunity for sinners to repent.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:30.960]   But when that period of his grace is done, when he comes to second coming, he's not coming
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.000]   to do what he did the first time.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.400]   What he did the first time was to come and introduce a way of salvation.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.880]   And those who are rejected salvation, he will come in full vengeance.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.480]   And that's how he's described in the book of Revelation.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:48.720]   OK.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.720]   (hissing)
