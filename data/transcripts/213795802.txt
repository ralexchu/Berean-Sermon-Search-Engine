[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240]   Okay, and I think other than that, if you can turn your Bibles with me to 1 Corinthians
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:19.360]   chapter 15, and we're going to read this text, and I'm not going to be expositing this text,
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.880]   but we're going to be talking about the significance of the resurrection, but I want to start off
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.880]   with reading this.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.040]   1 Corinthians 15, 17-19, and then we're going to jump to verse 32.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.360]   And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile, and you are still in your sins.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.040]   Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.080]   If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.800]   Verse 32, what do I gain if humanly speaking I fought with beasts at Ephesus, if the dead
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.760]   are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.080]   Let's pray.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:11.680]   Heavenly Father, we want to first thank you for giving us life.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.520]   We want to thank you for the life, the suffering, the death, and resurrection of our Lord and
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.560]   Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.080]   Because of that, we're able to live and move and have our being.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.440]   We thank you, Father God, for strengthening us, for persevering with us.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.920]   We thank you for the Holy Spirit that you've deposited in us, interceding on our behalf,
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.680]   that we may enter the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.380]   So we come before you this morning to worship you, to honor you, especially on this day.
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.640]   We ask, Lord, that your grace would be sufficient in our approach, in our worship, in our honor.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.640]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.800]   As some of you guys know, my family took a short trip to Korea and then we stopped by
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.680]   Japan for a couple of days and we came back.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.760]   I am known as the fob in our church.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.280]   Most people here, even if you're Korean American, you've probably been either born or raised
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.320]   here, second or third generation.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.520]   But even though I was born in Korea, there are certain things about the Korean culture
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.280]   that I really didn't understand.
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.160]   I noticed from a young age, and I'm not talking about those who are in their 50s and 60s,
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.520]   I'm talking about my parents' generation, like 80s and 90s and up.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.320]   And I noticed that that generation, especially when I started working in the Korean church,
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.640]   that they're not really good at planning ahead.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.000]   They don't believe in insurance, life insurance or anything that, you know, retirement.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.840]   They don't really think in that way.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.760]   They're really good at just surviving, you know, whatever it takes.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.640]   And they're hard workers and I respect them for that.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.400]   But for whatever the reason, they would never plan for the future.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.640]   Another thing that I realized was that there's a lot of people who are in their 80s, 70s
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.400]   or 80s that don't know their age or maybe older than that.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.460]   So you ask them how old they are and say, "Oh, I think I'm 82 or 83 or say 90 or whatever."
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.960]   And they wouldn't know their age.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.960]   And for years I was like, "Why would they not know their age?"
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.480]   And I realized later on that a lot of that was because they went through, that generation
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.960]   went through a severe war.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.800]   And so those of you guys who know the history of the Korean War, basically the war started
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.720]   between the North and the South and North came down and pushed the Korean population
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.240]   all the way to the tip in Pusan.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.760]   And then MacArthur and his army came and pushed him all the way back to the border of China
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.380]   and North Korea.
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.680]   And then the Chinese army came in and they pushed them all the way back and go back and
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.680]   forth.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.120]   So during that process, there wasn't an inch of the Korean peninsula that wasn't affected
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.920]   by this war.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.960]   And so during that period, some people were forced to, or not some people, most people
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.120]   had to flee from their homes.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.000]   They grabbed their bags and whatever that they had, whether they were rich or poor,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.960]   educated or uneducated, every single person had to live on the road going back and forth.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.140]   And so part of the reason why a lot of people didn't know their age was because they were
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.140]   pulled out.
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.820]   And in Korea, they don't register their children at the hospital.
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.940]   They have to register at another center.
[00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.780]   So if you happen to be born right during that period and your parents didn't register you,
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.380]   later on when they went back to school, they just kind of put them back.
[00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.540]   So some people went back after two years, some people went back after four years.
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.820]   So they have fellow classmates who are two years younger or four years older.
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.500]   And so it just kind of, imagine a country that was just kind of shaken up.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.800]   And then some people were living in the South, had to flee, or North had to flee to the South
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.520]   and South up North.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.500]   And then one day in the middle of this fight, they didn't want to cause another world war.
[00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.220]   So they just came out of World War II.
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.660]   So they said, you know, we're not to prevent World War III.
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.660]   They decided we're going to stop this war.
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.880]   So it wasn't a peace settlement.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.920]   They just decided we're going to stop this war.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.000]   And then they drew a line at the 38th parallel, which I call now like a DMZ area.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.200]   And if you happen to get stuck in the North, you couldn't see whoever it was.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.040]   It could have been your children, your grandparents.
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.680]   If you happen to go up there for business and you got stuck up there, you got stuck
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.200]   up there for good.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.080]   And so there's a lot of, if you talk to people who are from Korea, you ask them, are you
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.240]   South Korean, North Korean?
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.280]   Obviously, they're going to say South Korean.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.040]   But a lot of them have ancestors back in North Korea, because that's where they were born.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.040]   That's where their family is.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.400]   They were forced to come down.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.440]   So imagine if you went through something like that in your life, whether you were in your
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.880]   early, you know, like 10 or pure teens or teens, and, or maybe you were a young married
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.760]   couple and you got separated from your wife or your husband, or maybe you were a young
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.280]   family and while in the middle of fleeing, you lost your child and you don't know if
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.680]   he or she survived.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.760]   Can you imagine?
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:01.960]   Not just the small population, the whole population, all of Korea experienced something that dramatic.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.680]   In fact, some of you guys may know what budae jjigae is.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.800]   Some of you guys may know.
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.760]   Basically literally it means army base soup, basically.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.840]   And that soup, which is popular dish now, basically was the Koreans who were starving
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.400]   during this period because they didn't have food.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.160]   They started hanging around the US army base and whatever trash came out, they picked out
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.320]   whatever was edible, put it into a soup and they start cooking it to make it sanitary.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.640]   And I was talking to my mom about that and she said, "There isn't a single Korean during
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.280]   that period who didn't taste that."
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.680]   Today it became a dish, right?
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.200]   They have whole stores opened up and that's the signature dish that they sell.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.600]   But imagine the whole country went through all of that and how that would have affected
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   them.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.560]   So it helped me to understand that generation.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.020]   The reason why they do certain things and why they're able to, they're very scrappy
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.880]   and they're hard workers, but they don't think long term, right?
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.480]   They don't plan long term.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.200]   You could imagine how that affected their psyche and how that affected the way that
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.840]   they live.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.760]   So it helped me a lot to understand or to even get along with that generation because
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.760]   of that.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:16.880]   Now, I say all of this because at the core of Christianity, if you want to understand
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.240]   what the church is about, what Christianity is about, and for what's been happening for
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.120]   the last 2,000 years, we have to go to the core.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.160]   We have to go to the core history of Christianity, which is the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.400]   The resurrection of Jesus Christ isn't one of many things that the Christians believe.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:42.280]   All that we believe, all that we do, not just in our church, but all around the world, rises
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:48.080]   and falls upon the credibility of the physical resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.540]   Paul, again, in 1 Corinthians 15, 17, said, "If Christ has not been raised, your faith
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.880]   is futile and you are still in your sins."
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.000]   Meaning, it is absolutely useless.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.160]   If Christianity, all it is, is a worship or a veneration of a good moral teacher, if he
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.160]   hasn't truly been raised from the dead, basically everything that we do falls apart.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.480]   You don't have to argue about the validity of the scripture and about how the disciples
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.800]   came and did this and did that and how something contrary.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.480]   You don't even have to argue any of that.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.920]   All you have to do is disprove, without a shadow of a doubt, that the resurrection did
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.360]   not take place, then it crumbles all of Christianity.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.760]   In fact, Jesus himself says in Matthew 16, 4, because they kept on coming to him and
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:39.880]   asking for proof, "How can we possibly believe the things that you are saying?"
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.400]   And Jesus said to them, "A evil and wicked generation, I will give no sign except for
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.760]   the sign of Jonah."
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.360]   And he was referring to his death and resurrection.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:55.960]   So Jesus himself said that all that I am saying and all that I have said to you hinges upon
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.520]   and the proof that I'm going to give you is the resurrection.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.440]   So we can't overstate the significance of this day.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.360]   And we're not just talking about our church.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.240]   We're talking about every human being who has confessed Jesus Christ.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.960]   Many people who gave their lives to share this message.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.840]   Hundreds and thousands of churches who are trying to survive in the Middle East, risking
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.880]   their lives to get together to worship this Jesus.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:29.280]   All of it hinges upon this physical resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:36.440]   Now, you and I are all rational people, so we don't just believe anything.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.580]   And some people think that the church keeps saying that you need to believe Jesus Christ
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.720]   and just close your eyes and just take a leap of faith and say, "I'm going to believe.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.000]   I'm going to believe."
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.440]   Despite all the facts that point otherwise.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.800]   How can you possibly believe that?
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.640]   If you're a scientific person and you went to a university and you're logical, reasonable
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:02.280]   intelligence, how can you possibly believe that a human being came back from the dead?
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:09.560]   Well, just like anything else, we have to ask ourselves, is it reasonable or is it unreasonable?
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:14.800]   There are people in our generation today, in certain parts of the world, that come out
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.720]   and they completely deny the Holocaust.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.720]   Six million Jews were killed.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:24.860]   They have footages, they have films, they have eyewitnesses, they have people who survived.
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.600]   And yet they'll come out and say, "I don't believe it.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.080]   I think all that stuff is made up."
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.160]   9/11, some of you guys remember when that happened.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.840]   Some of you guys are probably a little bit too young to remember, or maybe you didn't
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.520]   exist at that time.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.160]   But when 9/11 happened, we saw the footages.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.200]   It was actually on live television.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.880]   But there are people who will come out and say that that didn't happen.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:52.240]   Or they have conspiracy theories and say, "Well, the Bush administration, they concocted
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.080]   this and they're the ones responsible for this."
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.280]   All because they wanted an excuse to get to the Middle East and get oil, forcefully take
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.280]   oil.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.640]   Now, when we hear things like this, any reasonable person will hear that and say, "Well, that's
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.280]   unreasonable, that's irrational because we have footages, we have eyewitnesses."
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.160]   Now we ourselves were not there.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.760]   We weren't there, we didn't touch it, but we just know that it's credible.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.000]   So when it comes to the resurrection, is it credible?
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.880]   Now we're not saying it's scientific, we don't have video footages, we don't have Jesus here
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.800]   saying that, "Here I am."
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.960]   But is it credible?
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.520]   Scriptures tell us that when Jesus was resurrected, he didn't just disappear and give this
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.520]   message and showed himself to Peter, and then Peter had the responsibility to go around
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.760]   telling people, "Trust me."
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:48.040]   In fact, if any other religion that you'll see, you have an individual who has an encounter
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:54.940]   with a being and basically all of what they're saying hinges upon the credibility of that
[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.200]   one person.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.440]   When Jesus was resurrected, he showed himself to over 500 people, stuck around for over
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:07.920]   40 days to make sure that there was enough eyewitnesses who would say that Jesus was
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.480]   resurrected.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:14.280]   Now if you're trying to create a religion and trying to get veneration and honor, that
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.560]   would be the worst way to go about doing that because they can easily test.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.520]   If you're going around saying, "Well, there were over 500 people," well, where are they?
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:28.560]   You could easily be able to identify or discredit them by saying that.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:35.040]   Not only that, immediately, as soon as Jesus was resurrected, the Jews and the Gentiles
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.200]   all of a sudden are in a room together and they started calling each other brothers.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.040]   They started selling possessions and donating it to the church so that the Jews could share
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.760]   with the Gentiles and the Gentiles could share with the Jews.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:53.580]   In our generation, that may not seem like much, but today if you look at how much the
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:59.400]   Republicans and the Democrats, I mean, they just despise each other.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.600]   Every little mistake they make, they'll harp on that and they'll jump on it and try to
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.600]   tear each other apart.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.080]   So can you imagine if you fell asleep for a few days and all of a sudden you woke up
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:13.480]   and found that the Democrats and Republicans decided to create one party and then now they
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.040]   call each other brother and sister?
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:21.600]   The hatred that the Jews had toward the Gentiles could not be exaggerated.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.640]   In fact, when they would travel between Jerusalem and Galilee, where Jesus' hometown, where
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:32.160]   he did most of the ministry, they would deliberately travel around Samaria, which was a Gentile
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:37.380]   area, about an hour or about a half a day journey more, just so that they don't have
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.800]   to encounter a Gentile.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.240]   They would pray daily that they thank God that God didn't make them a Gentile.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.720]   They considered themselves unclean.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.640]   If they were walking on the road and Gentile would be coming on the other side, they would
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.880]   deliberately cross and go to the other side because they thought they would make them
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.960]   unclean so they wouldn't eat with them.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:59.000]   They wouldn't be in the same house with them, let alone live in the same city.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.320]   So you imagine if the Gentiles were recipients of this kind of hatred from the Jews, you
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.880]   can imagine the kind of hatred the Gentiles had toward the Jews.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:15.080]   Not in 30 years, not in 60 years, not in 100 years, but immediately, immediately in the
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.800]   first century, the Jews and the Gentiles got together and began to call each other brothers
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.680]   and sisters in Christ.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.440]   Runaway slaves would voluntarily go back to their masters.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:32.840]   You have to understand a runaway slave going back to their master would mean capital punishment.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:39.120]   And if the master chooses not to accept them, they would have died instantly.
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.240]   Runaway slaves would volunteer to come back.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.520]   Pharisees, who were the religious leaders of that time, would sit under the teaching
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.120]   of tax collectors.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.040]   Again, if you know anything about the tax collectors and Pharisees of that time, there's
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.920]   another two groups who absolutely hated each other.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.680]   Tax collectors were considered the worst of sinners and Pharisees were considered the
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.500]   most righteous.
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:06.480]   They started to say that because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the tax collectors became
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:12.440]   the teachers who were discipled by Jesus and the Pharisees would sit under their tutelage.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.960]   Fishermen became teachers over scribes.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:22.080]   The very central message of the gospel that was being preached by the disciples centered
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.040]   around the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:32.560]   It would only make sense if you were an eyewitness of the resurrection of your Lord and Savior.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:38.400]   I mean, the only reasonable thing that you would think is to proclaim his resurrection,
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.120]   kind of like what Pastor Mark talked about this morning.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:47.120]   We can dig into the theology and the significance and the adoption and regeneration, propitiation.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:54.860]   We can talk about all of that stuff, but the simple reaction to the resurrection is, "Wow,
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.560]   he was resurrected."
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.420]   And that's all they could talk about.
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:03.440]   Whether it was in front of hostile crowd, whether they were at home, whether they were
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.920]   in front of the king.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.880]   When they were in front, all they could talk about was, "Jesus was resurrected from the
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.880]   dead."
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:16.800]   Now, does any of that prove that he was resurrected?
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.520]   Probably not.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.520]   But is it reasonable?
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.720]   Are these things that cause us to at least dig deeper?
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.880]   Are there enough things that's there for us to at least ask honest questions and say,
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.880]   "Well, why did that happen?"
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:37.440]   Well, secular scholars who aren't Christians look upon all the evidence of what happened
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:43.360]   in the first century, universally agree that at least the first generation Christians,
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.120]   they believe it.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:50.080]   Because their actions doesn't give credibility to something false.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:57.440]   So whether that actually happened or not, at least they all agree, at least they agreed.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:03.200]   Every single one of the disciples gave their life testifying that they were eyewitnesses
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.360]   to the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:13.920]   So some of the theories that have come up is because they can't discredit the eyewitnesses,
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.240]   so they'll say that Jesus was a mass hypnotist.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.640]   So he hypnotized everybody and then, and so it caused them to believe.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.400]   So mass number of people caused them to believe, even to the point of death.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.440]   Another theory that came up was the swoon theory, that Jesus didn't actually die, that
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.040]   he actually passed out for three days.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.000]   You know, he got tired and he's passed out.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.040]   And the third day, he kind of came back up and he's like, "Oh my gosh, he's resurrected."
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.520]   But he never died in the first place.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:46.040]   And then the third theory that came out was that Jesus had a twin brother.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.360]   And so one brother died and the other twin brother was hiding out behind the temple,
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:56.040]   all of a sudden came out and said, "Here I am, you know, I'm Jesus."
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:00.620]   As strange as those theories may be, these three theories, and these are coming from
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:06.160]   scholars of the New Testament, they're coming up because they refuse to believe that this
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.120]   could possibly happen.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:15.760]   See, understandably, that it is not just our generation, but even the early generation,
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:19.960]   even the disciples themselves had a hard time believing this.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:23.120]   Jesus made it very clear to his disciples what was going to happen.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.960]   But after he was crucified, the disciples didn't go looking for him.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.640]   It was the women.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.760]   It was women who were following him.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.600]   And they didn't go to see if he was resurrected, even though Jesus clearly prophesied that
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.600]   he would.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:40.280]   They went to anoint his body, which was a common ritual in the Jewish community.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.160]   And the story that we read this morning in John chapter 20 basically chronicles these
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:50.000]   women who went to anoint Jesus' body, and then they encountered Jesus.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.660]   This morning, quickly, I want to go over three things that Jesus claimed, and why the resurrection
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.280]   of Jesus Christ is so significant.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.160]   One, Jesus claimed to be God.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.440]   Jesus claimed to be God.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.880]   And this resurrection of Jesus Christ proved what he said.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.160]   Second, Jesus claimed to be able to forgive sins.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.960]   And thirdly, Jesus claimed to have power to give new life.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.160]   First, Jesus himself claimed to be God.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.440]   They didn't want to crucify him because Jesus came and said, "I'm the Messiah, and I'm
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.880]   going to help you to be delivered from the Romans."
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:34.600]   Remember in John chapter 6, after Jesus feeds the 5,000, they were so enamored with Jesus,
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.260]   they were forcefully trying to make him king.
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:43.780]   And Jesus, knowing what they were planning to do, he deliberately walks away from them.
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:48.520]   They didn't try to kill him because Jesus said he was the king of Israel, or he was
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.440]   the Messiah that they were prophesying.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:57.680]   In John chapter 5, 18, it says, "This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:03.300]   kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:08.240]   own father, making himself equal with God."
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.600]   I want you to let that sink in for a minute.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:19.520]   If the resurrection of Jesus Christ clearly declares that Jesus is God, what does that
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.700]   mean for us?
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:28.840]   If God himself came and walked on this earth, and he died and was resurrected to prove his
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.200]   deity, what does that mean for us?
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:36.160]   Romans chapter 1, 3-4 says, "Concerning his son, who was descended from David according
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:41.200]   to the flesh and was declared to be the Son of God, in power according to the Spirit of
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.860]   holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord."
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:50.320]   First and foremost, it says the resurrection proves what Jesus said about himself.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.920]   That he wasn't just a moral teacher, he wasn't just a good man, he wasn't just a good example
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:59.000]   to follow, he wasn't just the last of the prophets, but he was God himself.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.920]   I'm going to read you a quote from C.S. Lewis.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.760]   I think they're going to put it up here.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:09.120]   It's a little bit long quote, so I'm just going to read it and just follow along as
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.120]   I read it.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.040]   This is a quote from C.S. Lewis.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.880]   He's the author of Chronicles of Narnia, so you may be familiar with him, and he also
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:21.720]   wrote Mere Christianity, where this is the quote coming out from that book.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:27.000]   He says, "I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.040]   often say about him.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.960]   I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.960]   God.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.000]   That is the one thing we must not say.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.160]   A man who is merely a man and said the sort of things that Jesus said would not be a great
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.840]   moral teacher.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.600]   He would either be a lunatic on the level with the man who says he's a poached egg,
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.320]   or else he would be the devil of hell.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.880]   You must make your choice.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:58.760]   Either this man was and is the son of God, or else a madman or something worse.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.960]   You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon, or you can
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.960]   fall at his feet and call him Lord and God.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:11.300]   But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher.
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.640]   He has not left that open to us.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.700]   He did not intend to.
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:21.000]   Now it seems to me obvious that he was neither a lunatic nor a fiend, and consequently, however
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.120]   strange or terrifying or unlikely it may seem, I have to accept the view that he was and
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.660]   is God."
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.200]   There is no middle ground.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:37.840]   Either Jesus was a lunatic and he's deceived millions and hundreds of millions of people
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:44.760]   in the last 2,000 years, or he is who he claimed to be, the son of God.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:51.200]   Now we know that even the disciples, when they encountered the resurrected Christ, in
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:57.760]   Matthew 28 verse 9, the women fell at his feet and it says they worshipped him.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.840]   The word that is used here for worship is the word proskuneo, which is the most common
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.200]   word used for worship, and it literally means to prostrate oneself.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:11.600]   You know, there's a kind of worship that we give because you're supposed to, right?
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.960]   A lot of times on Sunday we come, "Oh, we're supposed to do this.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:16.960]   We're supposed to give.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.440]   We're supposed to sing."
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:24.720]   But the word proskuneo is a word that describes something that happens when you encounter
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.520]   something magnificent.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:31.800]   It is a natural response, and that's the word that is used when the women who went
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:37.320]   to see, to anoint his body, when they saw the resurrected body of Christ, their immediate
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:43.320]   knee-jerk reaction was to get on the floor, prostrate themselves in worship.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.840]   That's exactly what happens in Matthew 28 verse 16.
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:51.880]   When the 11 disciples who are remaining, they catch up with Jesus, it says this in verse
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.840]   16, "Now the 11 disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:03.360]   them, and when they saw him, they proskuneo," prostrated themselves, "and worshiped him."
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:08.880]   You have to understand, a Jew who worships any other being, any other thing other than
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.040]   God would have been guilty of capital punishment.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.080]   The first and the most important commandment of the Ten Commandments is, "Thou shalt have
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.180]   no other gods before me."
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:25.280]   It would be the blasphemy among blasphemy if they weren't absolutely convinced that
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.080]   Jesus Christ was God, for them to kneel down and worship him.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:33.120]   Now you have to understand, these are people who ate with him, who walked with him.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.200]   In fact, when Jesus was going to the cross, they were so confused.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.640]   Peter denied him.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:45.000]   And yet, when they saw the resurrected Christ, it hit them all at once.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.680]   He is who he said he is.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.520]   Can you imagine?
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.120]   It wasn't just any human being that resurrected.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:57.040]   Because they saw Lazarus come back from the dead by Jesus' power.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:01.600]   They realized that it wasn't just their master who died and then got resuscitated and came
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.600]   back.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:07.160]   They realized what Jesus said all along.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.540]   He is God.
[00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.200]   What does that mean for us as Christians?
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:17.760]   That we didn't come to worship or to venerate or honor a good man?
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.000]   He's God.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.920]   Our relationship with him ultimately, that we worship him and we obey him.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.960]   But beyond that, the reason why he declared himself to be God and the reason why they
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:36.980]   needed to know that he was God, because the second thing that he said was he had the authority
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.020]   to forgive sins.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:45.720]   In fact, in the scriptures, there's a scene where Jesus is preaching and he's talking
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:51.600]   about the kingdom and a group of friends had this man, a paralytic man who was lame all
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.840]   his life.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.920]   They heard about Jesus' miraculous power to heal people.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:01.080]   They break into his house and lower him and instead of healing him, Jesus says, "Your
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.400]   sins are forgiven."
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.400]   And they get angry.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.760]   Like, "Who are you to say that?"
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:10.440]   Because they understood what it meant for Jesus to say, "Your sins are forgiven."
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.840]   He said, "That's blasphemy."
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:18.520]   As long as Jesus was healing people and feeding people, walking on water, all of that stuff
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.680]   was great.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.640]   But for Jesus to say, "Your sins are forgiven."
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.600]   Who can forgive sins but God?
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.840]   How can you, a mere man, say your sins are forgiven?
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:35.560]   Only God, the creator of the universe who created our souls and our flesh, has the authority
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.160]   to forgive sins.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.400]   And they were absolutely right.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.800]   And Jesus says, "What is harder to do?
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.640]   To say your sins are forgiven or to get up and walk?"
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.800]   Now you have to understand, Jesus was the creator of the universe.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.360]   For him to say, "Get up and walk," was nothing.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.320]   He can pull money out of fish's mouth.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   He can walk on the water.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.520]   He can calm the storm.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:00.700]   To say to this young man, "Get up and walk," is nothing to him.
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:06.720]   But in order to say, "Your sins are forgiven," the Son of God had to empty himself, take
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:16.520]   on human form, walk and live a sinless life, give himself as a ransom for our sins, absorb
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:25.200]   our sins upon himself, that you and I may become the righteousness of God.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.940]   They were absolutely right.
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.720]   Jesus Christ was declaring to be God.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.200]   That the ultimate reason why he came was for our sins.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:39.560]   He didn't come because he saw them starving and decided, "You know what?
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.120]   I want to go and feed some of these hungry people."
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:48.080]   He didn't see mankind because they were limping around and some of them were living difficult
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.240]   lives.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:53.240]   He didn't have compassion on them because the Romans were suppressing them and he felt
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.960]   bad for his people.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.880]   He saw the world and in their sin, he had compassion.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:06.040]   See, the scripture says in Romans 5.12, "Just as sin came into the world through one man
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:11.160]   and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned."
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.400]   In fact, in verse 14, it goes even deeper than that.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:19.960]   It's that all human experience reigns under sin and death.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:20.960]   Sin and death reign.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:27.000]   You know, the word reign basically means that every aspect of human experience, human history,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.520]   is clouded under the umbrella of sin and death.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:39.520]   That may sound kind of dark and morbid, but let's take a step back and examine human
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.280]   history.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.280]   We don't even have to look far.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.960]   We don't need to dig through human history.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.560]   We don't need to dig through history of mankind.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.040]   Just look at ourselves.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:55.000]   How difficult it is for you and I just to even maintain relationships.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.960]   You know, one of the first things that we talk about in marriage counseling is biblical
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:04.480]   communication because communication is so difficult, right?
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:09.560]   Even between husband and wife, we live together, we eat together, we sleep together, and you
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:14.280]   make every effort to understand each other, and even then, you have fights.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:20.040]   You have fights because you have a hard time understanding because everything that we say,
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.920]   every communication that we have comes through a sinful filter.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:30.080]   There's a part of us that are insecure, and so we don't just say what we mean.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:35.700]   We say it with the thought of, "If I say this, how is she going to interpret this?
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.200]   If I say this, are people going to think that I'm proud?
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.280]   Oh, they said this to me, so let me say this to them."
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.440]   So much of our communication comes through a sinful filter, so by the time we hear what
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:51.000]   they're saying, we're not hearing exactly what needs to be said.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.960]   Now, I'm saying all of this just to give you an example.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:00.760]   When the scripture says, "Sin and death reigns over mankind," everything that you and I experience
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.280]   is tainted in some level with sin.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:15.080]   Husband and wife relationship, raising children, our coworkers, our friends, lifelong friends,
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:24.560]   politics, your boss, grandparents, everything that you and I experience is in some way tainted
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.760]   with sin.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.900]   The scripture says, "All have sin and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:34.940]   Every single human being is born with that inclination.
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.680]   Look at our politics.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:41.720]   The whole government of the United States is based upon power crops and absolute power
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.600]   crops absolutely.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:49.480]   Meaning, if you give a sinful man power, he's going to be corrupted, but if you give a sinful
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.280]   man absolute power, he's going to be absolutely corrupted.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:59.280]   So the base of the United States government is an understanding that we're all sinful.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.280]   Look at capitalism.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:05.900]   I remember in 1993, the first time I went to China where communism was, well, you can
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.640]   actually visually see communism.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.520]   Today you can't see it.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:14.080]   You go to Beijing or Shanghai, they're more capitalistic than they are here.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:19.360]   But at that time, almost everybody wore the same thing and they are all paid from the
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.520]   government.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:26.800]   And so the ideology about communism is, if you give the common man an opportunity to
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.200]   be good to his brothers, he will work harder.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.120]   And that's the basis of communism.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:37.680]   So I remember visiting China for the first time and every time we would walk into a restaurant,
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:41.040]   we would be met with anger.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:45.640]   And the reason why they would be angry is because we showed up, they have to work.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:49.760]   Usually they would have the lights turned off and then as soon as we walked in, they're
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.320]   like, that was their response.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.320]   It was like, "Welcome."
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.240]   It's like, and then they would walk into the kitchen.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.840]   Like, "I got to cook now."
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:03.160]   So you imagine what kind of food was going to come out with that attitude.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:08.360]   Remember everywhere we went, whether it was shops or markets, they had these things for
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.520]   foreigners to come in.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:14.000]   Everywhere they went, our presence meant that they had to work.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.400]   Capitalism on the other hand, is founded upon people work harder when they're selfishly
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:23.160]   motivated, if it's personally beneficial to you.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:26.760]   Now which works?
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.700]   It's pretty obvious.
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:35.320]   People work harder when there's personal benefit, not out of benevolence toward mankind.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:39.960]   I'm not saying that some of that is not there, but basically speaking, capitalism is founded
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:46.800]   upon the ideology that all have sin and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:52.640]   Everything that you and I experience is tainted under this curse of sin.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.880]   And that is why when Jesus came in Matthew 121, the angel announced to him by saying,
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.400]   "He will bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.960]   their sins."
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:10.640]   We can change the government, we can change the finances, we can change our outward circumstance,
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:17.480]   but God saw us and saw that our primary problem was not finance.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.280]   It wasn't human relationships.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:25.360]   That what was causing all this heartache was internal, and it was our sins.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:30.560]   And that's why Jesus Christ came and he said he came to deliver us from our sins.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:35.120]   In Isaiah 53, 5, it says, "But he was wounded for our transgression, he was crushed for
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.760]   our iniquities.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.420]   Upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace.
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:44.800]   And with his strife we are healed, and all we like sheep have gone astray.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:50.000]   We have turned everyone to his own way, and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.920]   all."
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:57.760]   The invitation that Christ made 2,000 years ago is the same invitation he makes today.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:01.480]   Jesus does not promise a better life, that your business is going to get better if you
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:06.720]   follow Jesus, that somehow if you're sick you're going to find health, that if you're
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.920]   lonely that somehow you're going to have friends all of a sudden around you.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:17.560]   Jesus came to deal with the primary problem of mankind, which is sin.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:21.120]   He says he has the authority to forgive sins.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:25.560]   Every single one of us, we sin because we've been sinned against.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:31.200]   The typical human experience, a husband goes to work, I mean it doesn't have to be a
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:35.160]   husband but just for illustration, my husband goes to work, he feels the pressure from his
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:39.200]   boss and they're being unfair, he should have gotten a promotion but the next guy got
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.400]   it and the guy who's maneuvering and lying and slandering, somehow he gets the promotion
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.480]   and he thinks life is unfair.
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.520]   He comes home and his wife says, "Hey, how come you don't share?"
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:52.440]   He's like, "You don't know what I'm going through at work, get off of me.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.600]   It's hard enough as it is and you come home and you make it difficult for me at home."
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.520]   And the wife is bitter and angry because she's been waiting to serve him all day and all
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:05.520]   of a sudden all he gets is the leftovers from work and she's bitter and angry.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:09.880]   And then the son comes home from school and he was supposed to do the dishes and he doesn't
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.240]   do the dishes.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.760]   And then all of a sudden she snaps in, "Why don't you do the dishes?
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.760]   You never do the dishes."
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.760]   And he's like, "What?
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.760]   I just came home."
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:21.960]   And he's angry and then his sister comes home and says, "Hey, get out of my room.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:22.960]   Pick up your socks."
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.960]   I'm like, "What's wrong with him?
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.720]   Every time I'm in the room he's yelling at me."
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.720]   She's angry.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.720]   She goes out.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:28.720]   She kicks the dog.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.360]   Dog bites the cat.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.000]   Cat goes out looking for mice.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.880]   And the cycle continues.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:45.920]   As silly as that might be, and it may not happen exactly like that, but I think every
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:50.840]   single one of us who've lived for a while can understand the experience of living in
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.680]   a sinful world that we've been sinned against in various ways.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:36:00.920]   And as a result, our natural tendency is to snap when something goes wrong.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.480]   Why do we get so angry when somebody cuts us off on the freeway?
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.160]   We're already on the edge.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:13.760]   Christ came and he's the only human being who lived a sinless life that when he was
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.400]   sinned against, he absorbed it upon himself.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:23.200]   He who knew no sin became sin that we might become the righteousness of God.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:31.880]   Not only did he react to the sins against him, for the very people that he came to love,
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:38.680]   he absorbs it on the cross and in his resurrection he pushes back.
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.680]   And he gives us new life.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.080]   And that's the third thing that he claimed.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.240]   He claimed to have the power to give life.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.440]   And that's what the resurrection ultimately really is.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:52.400]   It's the sin curse of mankind being reversed in resurrection so that we don't sin because
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.560]   we've been sinned against.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:57.760]   The scripture says we love because he first loved us.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:03.080]   And he's the only being in the universe who was able to absorb our sins.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:08.480]   And not only did he absorb it, he pushed back in his resurrection and gave us new life so
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:15.160]   that those who are under the condemnation of sin and this cycle of sin, now that curse
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:19.740]   is broken and he pushes us back.
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:23.880]   And he says now I've come to give life and to give this life abundantly.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:29.880]   And that's ultimately what the resurrection is about, is rescuing mankind from the reign
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.840]   of sin and death.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:37.120]   John 5 24 says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.480]   who sent me has eternal life.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:46.760]   He does not come into judgment but has passed from death to life."
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:51.560]   Ultimately the resurrection isn't about, well, let's see who Jesus is.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:52.560]   Is it real or not?
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:59.440]   All of these things are true, but the reason why it's important is because the only hope
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:04.960]   for sin is the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:10.160]   I want to end with a song that came to my mind as I was preparing this sermon.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.880]   And I know probably 90% of you probably don't know this song.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:17.680]   It's because it's written in the 70s and it is a country song.
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.820]   So for both reasons, right?
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:23.240]   Looking for love in all the wrong places.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.240]   Anybody know this song?
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.240]   Okay.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.600]   I know who you are.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:33.880]   The song says this, looking for love in all the wrong places.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:40.000]   I spent a lifetime looking for you, single bars and good time lovers, never true.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.320]   Playing a fool's game, hoping to win, telling those sweet lies and losing again.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:50.240]   I was looking for love in all the wrong places, looking for love in too many faces.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:54.840]   Searching your eyes, looking for traces of what I'm dreaming of.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.520]   Hoping to find a friend and a lover.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:00.240]   God bless the day that I discover another heart looking for love.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:04.360]   When I was alone then, no love in sight, and I did everything I could to get me through
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.880]   the night.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.480]   Don't know where it started or where it might end.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.240]   I turned to a stranger just like a friend.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:16.440]   I was looking for love in all the wrong places, looking for love in too many faces.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:22.020]   Searching your eyes, looking for traces of what I'm dreaming of.
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:28.520]   If you look at some of the most popular songs in human history and even modern history,
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:33.040]   some of the most popular songs are songs of suffering.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:36.200]   Songs of pain, hurt.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:40.120]   The reason why is because we can relate.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.460]   We can relate to the loneliness.
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.460]   We can relate to the searching in the dark.
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:47.160]   We can relate to the suffering.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.760]   Why are we able to relate?
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.200]   Why are mankind able to relate?
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.520]   Because this is human experience.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:58.880]   No matter how much we try to disguise this, sin has tainted everything that we do.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.080]   Some of us come from very difficult backgrounds at home, and you go to counseling and the
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.360]   first thing that they tell you is, "What did your mom do?
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.960]   What did your dad do?"
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.300]   And the way they sinned against you.
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.840]   We have children and we determined that we're never going to do this to our kids, but we
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.400]   can't turn off our sin.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.860]   We can't turn off our anger.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.280]   We can't turn off our bitterness.
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.000]   And so the cycle keeps going.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.020]   And so we hurt each other.
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:29.640]   And so the older you get, the more bitter we become because we experience more and more
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.120]   sin.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.360]   And this cycle doesn't end with you.
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:36.680]   No matter how much you're determined that you're not going to do this to your kids,
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.380]   you can't just turn this off.
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:43.680]   Your grandparents, great-grandparents, your parents, and you.
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:49.160]   Now if you've raised your kid to a certain age, I'll bet you every single parent who
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:54.360]   has children of a certain age wish they could do it over.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:59.200]   Because we can't just turn it off.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:04.600]   The only hope that we have is in the blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:09.920]   That because He absorbed our sins and He was resurrected and He became the first fruit
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:16.280]   among many who will be raised again, Jesus says, "Come to me all who are weary and
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.280]   heavenly laden."
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.880]   He said, "I will give you rest."
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:25.640]   This turmoil that you feel in your heart, I understand now.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:32.840]   Now that I'm hitting 50, the crisis of middle age, I get it now.
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:37.040]   I don't think I'm going through it, but I get it.
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.840]   I have friends who were living a perfectly peaceful life and all of a sudden they come
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.440]   back with a tattoo.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.840]   They're riding a Harley around.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.600]   I'm like, "Dude, you're 50.
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.960]   You're scaring your kids."
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:51.960]   But I get it.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:55.920]   When you're in your 20s, you live to think that I'm going to invest and then 30s come
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:02.160]   around and your 30s, you work hard to get ahead, to become a CEO, to get a better job,
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.360]   to make right investments.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:08.320]   You make it to your 40s, you become middle management, then you work hard.
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.720]   But by the time you get to your 50s, you're not looking forward to your 60s because 60s
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.280]   is your retirement.
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:18.400]   And so if by the time you reach 50, you examine your life and you're not where you want to
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:24.160]   be and you start to think, "Was this it?
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:28.200]   Everything that I've invested in, everything that I've sacrificed, everything that I was
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:31.720]   looking forward to, is this it?"
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:37.240]   And so you have a life crisis because every single human being born into this earth has
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:41.360]   a slow march toward the end of our life.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.560]   That is not just a few of us.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:49.640]   That's every single human being that is born has an expiration date and we all know it.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.360]   But there's this innate desire to live.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:58.960]   As soon as you're born, our baby comes out sucking, looking for food.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:42:59.960]   Every single human being.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:00.960]   They're not taught that.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.360]   They're born with this innate desire to live.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:09.240]   And ever since we're an infant until the day we die, there's this survival mode.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.960]   We need to live.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:14.560]   But we don't know how.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:18.640]   Because we've been disconnected with the author of life.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:24.400]   And as a result of this disconnection, we're trying to make the most of this life.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.080]   So some people will say it's about traveling.
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.380]   Some people will say it's about food.
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.960]   Some people say it's about getting the most.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.440]   Some people will say it's about family.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.040]   But we don't really know.
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:39.720]   You're just trying to make the most of what you have.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:43.840]   But deep inside you know there's an emptiness.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.840]   There's a disconnection.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:56.080]   See, Jesus when he was coming into Jerusalem, they were all so elated.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:59.120]   Because they said, "Finally the Messiah is going to come.
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.240]   He must be the Messiah.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.240]   He's riding on a donkey.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.440]   He's a fulfillment of prophecy."
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:07.840]   So they were so elated and excited because it meant that possibly he's going to overthrow
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.460]   the Roman government.
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:11.360]   Maybe the hungry will be fed.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.140]   The lame will walk.
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.900]   Even if you die, Lazarus is raised from the dead.
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:19.020]   Who wouldn't want this as their king?
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:25.800]   And yet, Jesus as he's walking in, we see him weeping.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.800]   He's weeping.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:32.080]   And the reason why he was weeping, he says, "Only if you knew this day what would truly
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.680]   bring peace."
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:35.840]   It wasn't government.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.840]   It wasn't finance.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.880]   It wasn't health care.
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:47.240]   The Son of God came, stepped off of his throne, lived a humble life, a perfect life, and he
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:51.160]   gave himself to sinners to be crucified.
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:57.140]   He absorbed sins of man, past, present, and future.
[00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:00.600]   And he reconciled us to his Father.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:05.800]   And then he resurrects as the first fruit among many to be born again.
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.760]   That's what Christianity at the core is about.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:14.440]   It's not ultimately about being a good person, although God commands us to do so.
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:18.480]   It's not about being faithful to church, although God commands us to do so.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:25.320]   But at the core of Christianity, the core of his death and resurrection is this life
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.360]   that we lost at the fall.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:34.120]   That this life that we so eagerly desire and are looking for in all the wrong places, in
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:39.080]   too many faces, can only be found in Christ.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:45.960]   Jesus said in John chapter 4 that the water that this world gives you, you may drink of
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:53.000]   it and you may quench your thirst for a period, but Jesus says, "I am the living water.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   The water I give you will well up into eternal life, and whoever drinks of it will never
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.200]   thirst."
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:04.200]   I pray that this morning, as some of you have come and may have heard the gospel for the
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:08.240]   first time, maybe you heard it many times, but you haven't thought too seriously about
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:12.760]   the meaning and significance of it.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:20.160]   I pray that at least, at the minimum, that you wouldn't simply dismiss the resurrection
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.240]   just as a prejudice.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.000]   I can't imagine this happening.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.840]   There was a period of time when they thought that grain of sand was the smallest particle,
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:31.080]   and then they found the atom, and then they split the atom, and they found the neutrons
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:35.760]   and electrons, and then I found out that they actually found out there's actually three
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.640]   smaller particles even beneath that.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:42.880]   And then you start studying the universe, and they thought that the earth and the solar
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:47.320]   system, that was it, and the more and more they studied, they found out just how gigantic
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.680]   the universe is.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:53.320]   But there was a period of time when people rejected all of that because they couldn't
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:55.840]   see it.
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:02.640]   I pray with all my heart that at the minimum, that you would examine carefully, if Jesus
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:09.880]   Christ was raised from the dead, could he really be the answer to man's problems, to
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:17.360]   your longing, to your emptiness, to the question of what is the meaning of life?
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.360]   If you can take a minute to pray with me as I invite the praise team to come up.
