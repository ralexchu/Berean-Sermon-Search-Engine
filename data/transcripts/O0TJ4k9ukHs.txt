[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   All right. Good evening, everybody.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Before I read the passage,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   just wanted to, by way of like a quick review,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   I wanted to throw the question out there for you again.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Is the gospel really good news to you?
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   And in the past, I've shared with you,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   like if a person has had cancer to hear that you are cancer free,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   that's really good news.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Today, we're looking at someone who should have gone to jail
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   with a lock, everything locked, key thrown away,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   but you're free.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Or someone who's in a very, very, very, very bad contract
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   and the contract has been ripped up.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   So that's what we're looking at today.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   Okay, so with a meaty passage like this one,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   you are going to be tempted to just think about this all just academically.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   But the encouragement is, why is this important to you?
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   What are the ramifications of this to you?
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   How has this affected your eternity?
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   How has this affected your outlook on life, on the future?
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   How has all of this played out into your life?
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   And that's, if we just treat this as a theology in academics,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   you're going to miss the whole point, all right?
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   So we're going to read the passage.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   I'm going to pray for us, or read the questions,
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   and then pray for us, and then we'll dismiss.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   "Why the law then?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   It was added because of transgressions,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   having been ordained through angels by the agency of a mediator
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   until the seed would come to whom the promises had been made.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Now a mediator is not for one party only, whereas God is only one.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Is the law then contrary to the promises of God?
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   May it never be, for if a law had been given which is able to impart life,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   then righteousness would indeed have been based on the law.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   But the Scripture has shut up everyone under sin,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Therefore, the law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   so that we may be justified by faith."
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Okay? Let's look at these questions.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   Question number two, in your observations, you're going to be hitting on these points.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   What exactly is the law?
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   What was its role function before Christ?
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Three, what is the mediator?
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   What is the role of the mediator?
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   And I just want to hedge you in a little bit.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   This may not be the same thing as we have one mediator
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   between God and man, the man Jesus Christ.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   This might not be the same context, so that's just as a warning.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Number four, what does it mean to be enclosed, to be shut up under sin?
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   But what does it mean to be that way to the faith?
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   Okay? Because that's the language of the passage.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   So, let me pray for us, and then at 810 we'll reconvene.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Father, we're so thankful to be here tonight.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   I pray that you would help us in these last two weeks to just engage well,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   to draw well, to feed well from just your truth.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   I pray that every group will not get lost in the thick of the wording in the theology,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   but all of that would cause us both to feel overwhelmed,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   just with the great privilege to know you.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   And I pray that you would help our study to cause us to just worship,
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   cause us to be grateful, and to lead lives that reflect your kindness.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   And so, would your word do its work, and we avail ourselves to that work.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   So we thank you, Lord, and we entrust this time into your care.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   We'll see you at 810.

[01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:21.600]   OK. Knee jerk questions. All right? So just everything that we learned from the last couple passages this last semester of Galatians, is the law bad?
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:33.600]   No. It's good. Right? It's good. Even though Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us.
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:40.600]   But God says it's good. Is obedience to the law required?
[01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:58.600]   Yes. Absolutely yes. Because God wants you to be holy as he is holy. So law, obedience, is required.
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:05.600]   But can a person be saved through obeying perfectly this law?
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:11.600]   No. Has anyone succeeded?
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:15.600]   No. Except Jesus.
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:25.600]   So that's, there's going to be some tension building and there should be some like cognitive constipation happening in your head.
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:35.600]   And we're going to get to this next one. So then, if the Christian is free from the law,
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:42.600]   can he live however he pleases? Yes.
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:48.600]   Ooh. Tension.
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:57.600]   But what would please the Christian who's had an absolute heart DNA transformation?
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:03.600]   His desire would be to what? Please his Lord.
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:08.600]   That's going to be the flow. Alright?
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:17.600]   For context, I want to backtrack a little bit so that we keep the verses 19 to 24 kind of hedged in. Alright?
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:27.600]   The scripture, verse 8, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham saying,
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:34.600]   "You will be blessed in you. So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham the believer.
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:38.600]   For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse, for it is written,
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:42.600]   Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law to perform them.
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:46.600]   Now that no one is justified by the law before God is evident.
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:52.600]   For the righteous man shall live by faith. However, the law is not of faith.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:25:00.600]   He who practices the law shall live by all the law. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law,
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:05.600]   having become a curse for us. For it is written, Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree.
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:09.600]   This makes the law feel bad, but it's not. Right?
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:17.600]   So in order that, in Christ Jesus, the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:21.600]   The word law, the word faith is going to come out again and again and again.
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:25.600]   Fast forward a little bit to verse 17. What I am saying is this.
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.600]   Paul is saying, my language is pretty hard to understand so I'm going to re-clarify.
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:39.600]   Verse 17. I'm saying this, okay? The law which came 430 years later does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God so as to nullify the promise.
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:48.600]   For if the inheritance is based on law, it is no longer based on a promise, but God has granted it to Abraham by means of a promise.
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:55.600]   So, by way of review, when God makes a promise, is he a promise keeper?
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:26:00.600]   Yes. Does he change his promise? No.
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:08.600]   So this was not covered last week, but when God made a covenant in the presence of Noah, he made it by a promise.
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.600]   What did he say in Genesis chapter 9 verse 13?
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:18.600]   I put a bowl in the clouds as a sign of the covenant between me and the earth. I'm never going to wipe it away by the flood.
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:22.600]   He makes a covenant with Abraham by means of a promise.
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:30.600]   I will bless you. I will make your name great. I will bless those who bless you. Whoever curses you, I will curse. I will multiply your seed.
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:36.600]   I will cause you to be a great nation. And you all, the nations, will be blessed.
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:38.600]   So he makes a promise to Abraham.
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:46.600]   And then God makes a promise with David. He makes a covenant with David, which launches off of the covenant with Abraham by means of a promise.
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:54.600]   New covenant. Also stemming from the promise with Abraham. Also through a means of a promise.
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:27:07.600]   And I showed you last week, promise, promise, promise. So the path to salvation is all God says it, and it's going to happen.
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:11.600]   Because he promises that it will be the case.
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:20.600]   Okay? So these covenants is a road map to how people are going to be saved and reconciled to God.
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:26.600]   Justification, we learned, is what? Being right with God. Right?
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:37.600]   And we looked at, last week, Matthew 1.1 says, "The record of genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham."
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:45.600]   I will change the word Messiah to "promised one." And I will change the word son to seed.
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:56.600]   And I'll read it again. "The record of the genealogy of Jesus, the promised one, the seed of David, the seed of Abraham."
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:04.600]   And this chart, hopefully it will help you at home, just to kind of organize certain things in your head.
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:08.600]   But the verbiage is the same, and the duration is the same.
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:14.600]   Last week we looked at Jeremiah 31. I want to take you back to Ezekiel 36.
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:18.600]   And I want you to pay attention to all the "I wills" that God makes in this promise.
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:23.600]   "I will take you from the nations. I will gather you from all the lands." I'm getting excited.
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:29.600]   "I will bring you into your own land. And then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean.
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:36.600]   I will cleanse you from all your filthiness, from all your idols. Moreover, I will give you a new heart
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:43.600]   and put a new spirit within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:50.600]   I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes, and you will be careful to observe my ordinances.
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:58.600]   You will live in the land that I gave to your forefathers, so you will be my people and I will be your God."
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:04.600]   All of these things are unconditional, unilateral, all promise.
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:10.600]   All emphasizing the God will, God will, God will, God will, God will. Everlasting.
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:13.600]   And how long is everlasting?
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:19.600]   There's no time. It's forever. Right? It's everlasting.
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:21.600]   Okay?
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:26.600]   The record of the genealogy of Jesus, the Messiah, the seed of David, the seed of Abraham.
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:32.600]   Jesus came and all the promises were fulfilled.
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:41.600]   Okay? All things are now different with Jesus entering into the picture.
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:47.600]   So the promises are fulfilled in Jesus. That's Galatians 3, 1-18.
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:49.600]   Does this make sense?
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:55.600]   All of these rolling covenants, God said, "Amen" when he sends Jesus.
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:30:02.600]   That's why Paul, there's an interesting verse in 2 Corinthians 1-20.
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:10.600]   "For as many as are the promises of God, in Him, Christ Jesus, they are yes.
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:17.600]   Therefore also through Him is our Amen to the glory of God through us."
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:23.600]   So every promise of God is a big ol' Amen in the person of Jesus Christ.
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:27.600]   You guys tracking? That's great news for us.
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:31.600]   So then, what is the purpose of the law?
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:34.600]   Do we still have to keep it?
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:36.600]   Why did God give it?
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:40.600]   How is it really good if it condemns us all?
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:43.600]   These are natural questions that well up.
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:46.600]   So this is how I kind of charted it out.
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:50.600]   You notice, I do this and I see a lot of law in yellow.
[01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.600]   I'm like, "Oh, okay, that's mentioned a lot."
[01:30:53.600 --> 01:31:00.600]   So I look at the promises and I pull out three questions that are going to be addressed.
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:04.600]   What is the purpose of the law is the first question.
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:07.600]   The second question that naturally will come about is,
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:14.600]   then are the promises of God and then the law of God in conflict
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:18.600]   is another mental disturbance that my mind goes through.
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:25.600]   The third one, then what was the function of the law
[01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:29.600]   is going to be what's answered in the third little section.
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:34.600]   So that's how I break it up.
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:36.600]   But for lack of time, I'm not going to go into all of that.
[01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:41.600]   But I'm going to go through today three things about the law.
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:47.600]   The first one is that the law was to be temporarily added.
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.600]   It wasn't permanent.
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.600]   Remember at the bottom of that first chart, everything is how long?
[01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:54.600]   Everlasting.
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:59.600]   The law is not everlasting, it's temporary.
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:05.600]   The second is that the law was to be very telling.
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.600]   I just had to use alliteration.
[01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:09.600]   So telling, just deal with it.
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:11.600]   It was to be telling.
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:13.600]   What's it going to tell? I'll tell you in a bit.
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:16.600]   Third, the law was to be a tutor.
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:18.600]   This is not a teacher.
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:20.600]   This is not like, how many of you guys were tutors?
[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:23.600]   I did SAT, verbal, I did some math.
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:26.600]   This is not that kind of a tutor.
[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.600]   And we'll get into that.
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:31.600]   So first thing, and I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this.
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:35.600]   The law was to be temporarily added.
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:38.600]   The word until the seed kind of gives that away.
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:40.600]   Make sense?
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:45.600]   So once the seed came, the law was fulfilled.
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:49.600]   Jesus says in Matthew chapter 5, I did not come to abolish the law.
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.600]   What did he say?
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:53.600]   I came to fulfill it.
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:33:02.600]   So the law is still there, but it's different.
[01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:04.600]   It's been satisfied.
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:13.600]   It's temporarily, it was temporarily a tutor until Christ's fulfillment.
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:15.600]   Okay?
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:19.600]   So this was the part that I inserted last week.
[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:27.600]   So the law, unlike the promises, were conditional.
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:29.600]   They were bilateral.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:33.600]   It was a handshake contract.
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:36.600]   Right? The Israelites actually performed this.
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:39.600]   They got pools of blood splashed on them and they said,
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:44.600]   "We shall obey, we shall obey, we shall obey," and splash, sploosh.
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:46.600]   So they went through this.
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:50.600]   They agreed to God that they would fulfill it.
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:53.600]   Did they fulfill it or did they mess up?
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.600]   Oh, they messed up real good. Right?
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:58.600]   Okay? So it's a contract.
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:03.600]   Okay, good thing I'm tall.
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:07.600]   The verbiage, it's a lot of, oh my goodness.
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:14.600]   It's a lot of, "You shall, you shall not, you shall, you shall not."
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:18.600]   Okay? And the duration is, it was temporary,
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:22.600]   abolished in the death of Christ, so it's no longer in play.
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:24.600]   Okay?
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:28.600]   And the law was used as a threat.
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:33.600]   It's a threat of what is due.
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:37.600]   You mess up, you mess up, kicked out of the land.
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:39.600]   You mess up, generation wiped out.
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:41.600]   You mess up, all your armies will be destroyed.
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:45.600]   Oh, you mess up, you're going to eat your own children.
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:47.600]   For reals.
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:50.600]   There's things that are happening in there. Okay?
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:57.600]   It was conditional, bilateral contract, and temporary.
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:00.600]   Now, I just wanted to make a brief note on the mediator thing
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:04.600]   because some of you guys might have a little scratch that needs to be itched.
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:07.600]   I mean, itch that needs to be scratched. Okay?
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:13.600]   When God gave this covenant to the people,
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:18.600]   it was not like how he made it with Abraham, David, or revealed to the prophets.
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:21.600]   It was different because he made it through a mediator.
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:27.600]   God went through angels who revealed things to Moses.
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.600]   Okay?
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:34.600]   Now, notice, there's a scene where Moses actually asks God, "Show me your glory."
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:36.600]   And God says, "I cannot show you myself or you will die."
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.600]   What does God do?
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:43.600]   He hides him in the crevice and a little bit of the afterglow of the passing byness of God,
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:47.600]   Moses sees it and it's so amazing that it radiates off his face.
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:50.600]   So when Moses receives the Ten Commandments,
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.600]   he is not in the presence of God there.
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.600]   Okay?
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:57.600]   We don't see this in the Exodus account,
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.600]   but there are angels there who are giving it to Moses,
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:02.600]   who then takes it down to the people.
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.600]   And he has to do that twice because he gets so mad he throws it.
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:06.600]   Right?
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:11.600]   So now, this is the blessing with which Moses the man of glad blessed the sons of Israel before his death.
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:16.600]   He said, "The Lord came from Sinai and dawned on them from Seir.
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:22.600]   He shone forth from Mount Paran and he came from the midst of 10,000 angels.
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:25.600]   At his right hand there was flashing lightning for them."
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:32.600]   So the people were so scared because they saw the mountain quaking and shaking and on fire like they have never seen it before.
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:34.600]   So they couldn't go near it.
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.600]   Nod your heads if you have ever read that story.
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.600]   There's stuff happening.
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.600]   And we don't know all the details,
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:43.600]   but there were 10,000 of his holy angels there.
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:45.600]   Okay?
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:48.600]   Acts chapter 7 in Stephen's sermon he also retells this.
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:53.600]   This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness together with the angel who was speaking to him on Mount Sinai
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:59.600]   and who was with our fathers and he received living oracles to pass on to you.
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:03.600]   Hebrews chapter 2 verse 2 also talks about through angels.
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:06.600]   And that's why in the beginning of Hebrews he says, "Christ is better than the angels.
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:08.600]   Christ is better than Moses."
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:11.600]   And it's a long elaborated argument.
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:13.600]   Okay?
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:16.600]   With Abraham he didn't have any mediator.
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:19.600]   God just showed up at Abraham's home.
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.600]   You guys know this?
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:24.600]   Every time God interacts with Abraham it's direct.
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:26.600]   He eats with him.
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:30.600]   He makes a covenant with him and he swears by himself.
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:32.600]   Okay?
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:38.600]   And he said, "By myself I have sworn and declare as the Lord because you have done this thing and I have not withheld your son, your only son."
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:41.600]   And then God gives that promise to Abraham.
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:44.600]   There is no mediator there.
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:47.600]   Now, going back to this.
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:50.600]   The law was temporarily to be added.
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:53.600]   The law was to be telling.
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:55.600]   Why was the law added?
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:57.600]   Because of transgressions.
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.600]   And that can mean many different things.
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:02.600]   And grammatically I think it's left vague because it can mean many different things.
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:05.600]   It's like me saying,
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:12.600]   "I went to the hospital yesterday because of Becky, my wife."
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:15.600]   What could that mean?
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:18.600]   Many things.
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.600]   So, because of transgressions,
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:24.600]   the law is added.
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:26.600]   And I look at it as this.
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:29.600]   The law is very telling of,
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:34.600]   the first one is the law is very telling of the character of God.
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:37.600]   It tells mankind who he is.
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:44.600]   That he is holy, holy, holy, far beyond who you are.
[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:47.600]   He is completely other.
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:53.600]   He is more different from you and me than we are to a mosquito.
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:58.600]   Because at least with the mosquito, what you and I have in common with the mosquito is we're all created beings.
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:01.600]   And we need blood to live.
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:03.600]   God is completely other.
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:10.600]   So, in the law he gives, he gives things that are not contradictory to his character.
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:13.600]   He gives representations of his character to the people.
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.600]   You guys tracking?
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:20.600]   The second thing that the law does is it exposes the depravity of man.
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:27.600]   We are so corrupt that we don't just get offended by the law, we get aroused by it.
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:31.600]   If we're told, "Hey, don't go there."
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:33.600]   What do we want to do?
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:36.600]   I want to go there.
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:39.600]   "Don't eat that."
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:41.600]   What do we want to do?
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:43.600]   That must be pretty good.
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.600]   That's what happens to us.
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:48.600]   Whenever something is forbidden, we want it more.
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:51.600]   This is a random example.
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:55.600]   In Europe, alcohol is like soda.
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.600]   You guys know this, right?
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.600]   Beer is like soda.
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:02.600]   So, teenage kids drink beer.
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:06.600]   But in America, it's like, "Ooooh."
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:15.600]   So, we are so foul that the presence of the law incites and arouses more sin.
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.600]   That's how depraved we are.
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:21.600]   It's like this ginormous squeeze of a sponge.
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:24.600]   And the law squeezes and everything comes out.
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:28.600]   So, the law is also to show the depravity of man.
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:36.600]   And the law is also very telling of man's desperate need of a savior.
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:38.600]   And that's the entire book of Leviticus for you.
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:43.600]   How can holy God and sinful man be reconciled again?
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:48.600]   It's going to take the death of an innocent, substitutionary lamb.
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:52.600]   So, that's what the law is very telling of.
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:54.600]   In and of itself, it is good.
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:56.600]   But for us, it's bad news.
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:59.600]   Okay?
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.600]   You guys tracking?
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:05.600]   Now, here's a very profound quote.
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:13.600]   "The law is for the proud and the gospel for the brokenhearted," says Martin Luther.
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:23.600]   "The person who can distinguish between the law and grace can thank God and know himself to be a true Christian."
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:39.600]   The non-Christian believes himself to somehow be able to manipulate God to give a thumbs up.
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:43.600]   That's most of the rest of the world.
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:45.600]   Right?
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:53.600]   The non-Christian believes that as long as there is a certain mathematic metric where the good outweighs the bad,
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:57.600]   they're going to heaven in the presence of holy, holy, holy God.
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:41:59.600]   Utter stupidity and folly.
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:05.600]   The Christian understands who he's not before God.
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:11.600]   The Christian understands that without grace, I have zero hope.
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:21.600]   The Christian understands that every single righteous deed that I perform in the presence of holy God, Isaiah 64 6, is like a filthy rag.
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:23.600]   You know what a filthy rag is equivalent of?
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:27.600]   A woman menstruates on a pad and gives that as an offering.
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:28.600]   That's a filthy rag.
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:39.600]   Me, giving a $5 bill to a homeless man on the street before a holy, holy, holy God, that is as offensive as a filthy rag.
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:42.600]   I cannot curry any favor from this God.
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:49.600]   So a genuine Christian understands law, grace, and that it is all by grace.
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:43:02.600]   If in your heart you still have a works-based system that you cannot shake, that's evidence of something missing.
[01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:08.600]   And we all feel when we've rebelled against God, we feel it, of course.
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:18.600]   But if you feel like you have to do something to clean your act up before you can come to the presence of God, that's utter stupidity.
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:23.600]   You guys tracking along?
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:27.600]   The law was to be a tutor.
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:34.600]   And I'm going to spend just a couple moments on this and then move on.
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:39.600]   The word "paitagagas" is a slave.
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:41.600]   Didaskalos is a teacher.
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:45.600]   Someone who's teaching facts, that's a didaskalos, that's a teacher.
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:54.600]   A paitagagas is a slave entrusted to the supervision of a young boy on its parent's behalf.
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:44:03.600]   So culturally, a parent entrusts the paitagagas with charge of the kid.
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:08.600]   Ultimately for the safety of the kid, but for the instruction of the kid.
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:14.600]   And a lot of the rule of thumb was, if he gets out of line, beat him up.
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:17.600]   That was great Greco-Roman culture.
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:19.600]   Not "cam out."
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:22.600]   That was a paitagagas.
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:30.600]   It's a chaperone to keep the child safe from trouble, from danger, to make sure that the child didn't do harmful things.
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:33.600]   So they were very Asian.
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:36.600]   Memes all the time.
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:38.600]   Okay?
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:41.600]   So here's John Starr in his research.
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:48.600]   They took their young charges to and from school, made sure they studied their lessons, trained them in obedience.
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:54.600]   They were very strict disciplinarians, scolding and whipping as they felt it necessary.
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:58.600]   He was often harsh to the point of cruelty.
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:03.600]   And it's usually depicted in ancient drawings with a rod or a cane in his hand.
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:06.600]   It's like the equivalent of a strict governess.
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:10.600]   So this was the mental understanding of a paitagagas.
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:17.600]   Trusted by the parent to keep the child in line.
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:31.600]   And so most, if you go into the research on this, young Greco-Roman men celebrated, like 13-year-old, you know, the Jews celebrate bar mitzvah where they become a man.
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:38.600]   The young men in Greco-Roman culture would celebrate when they were old enough where they can't get no memen no more.
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:42.600]   They had a party when the paitagagas is out of their lives.
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:47.600]   Even though some of them were nice, most of them were not.
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:49.600]   Okay?
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:55.600]   So Paul, just a little context from biblical, so you can, when we read 1 Corinthians 4, it kind of helps us understand.
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:46:03.600]   Hey, for if you were to have countless paitagagoi, tutors in Christ, yet you would not have many fathers.
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:06.600]   For in Christ Jesus I become your father through the gospel.
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:09.600]   So what do you want? What do you desire?
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:14.600]   Shall I come to you with a rod like a paitagagas or with love and the spiritual gentleness?
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:16.600]   And so you get a little bit of an insight.
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:18.600]   So this was commonly understood.
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:20.600]   Keep you in check.
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:22.600]   That was the purpose of the law.
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:25.600]   By any means necessary.
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:27.600]   Okay?
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:31.600]   This is the pathway to salvation.
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:37.600]   This was added temporarily until the promised seed would come.
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:39.600]   Then the law is fulfilled.
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.600]   The wrath of God is satisfied.
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:49.600]   And the thing that is required for full receiving of this is repentance and faith.
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:52.600]   Those go hand in hand.
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:55.600]   If you guys know Romans 1 to 2.
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:59.600]   Therefore there is now no what?
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:03.600]   No condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:09.600]   For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death.
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:13.600]   That's a very well memorized chapter 8 verse 1 and 2.
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:15.600]   But you know what's interesting? Verse 3 and 4.
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:19.600]   For what the law could not do.
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:25.600]   Weak as it was through the flesh, God did.
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:30.600]   Sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:36.600]   And as an offering for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh.
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:42.600]   Why? So that the requirement of the law might be fulfilled.
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:48.600]   In us, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:54.600]   Brothers and sisters, may we do everything that our regenerated hearts desire.
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:48:06.600]   Because if you're still thinking of what can I get away with and still receive a pass from hell.
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:13.600]   That question in of itself might be very telling.
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:19.600]   That you don't know what it means to have been changed by the power of God.
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:25.600]   Next week is a preview. Verse 25.
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:31.600]   Therefore the law has become our tutor unto Christ.
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:34.600]   So that we would be justified by faith.
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:37.600]   Now that faith has come.
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:41.600]   We are no longer under a tutor. Praise God.
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:44.600]   So that's a preview for next week.
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:53.600]   The non-Christian will read this and be like, "Cool. No rules."
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:56.600]   And I want to close with this illustration.
[01:48:56.600 --> 01:48:58.600]   I am a dad.
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:02.600]   My kids are eight, almost nine.
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:07.600]   I want to do everything that I can for their good.
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:13.600]   I've given them laws. I've given them rules. I've given them principles.
[01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:24.600]   Hopefully when they're adults, they don't go, "Cool. No more daddy. I can do whatever I want."
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:32.600]   That isn't the appropriate response of a kid who understands the heart of his father.
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:34.600]   Right?
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:42.600]   What I would hope for is that my child, because he loves me, because he knows me, because I've loved him well,
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:50.600]   that he grows up replicating my character in every good way that I can possibly hope for.
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:55.600]   He is a little mini me of virtue walking around in the world.
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:00.600]   That's the appropriate response of good parenting.
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:02.600]   Right?
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:10.600]   So the heart of a true child of God is, "I want to be like my daddy."
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:13.600]   And we're not even thinking about the rules.
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:16.600]   We're thinking about his pleasure.
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:22.600]   So, and that's what we're going to be looking at in chapters five, especially in chapter six.
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:24.600]   Okay?
[01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:27.600]   Alright. I'll stop sweating again. It's winter.
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:30.600]   Upcoming events. We've got the Christmas parties.
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:35.600]   As was announced on Facebook this Sunday, we need to clear all of this out.
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:39.600]   So I'm not sure how it's going to work in terms of the hours for the cafe.
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:46.600]   Please be mindful, as soon as second service is done, we're going to have to start setting everything up in the sanctuary
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:50.600]   and in this whole building for the family ministry Christmas party.
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:52.600]   There's like 400 people involved.
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:54.600]   So just, we've got lots of families.
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:51:00.600]   Okay, so please do be mindful and help us to get through that as quickly as we can for the setup.
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:03.600]   The 31st is coming up.
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:05.600]   Well, Christmas is coming up.
[01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:10.600]   We have 2,000 flyers printed for you to invite people out to our Christmas party.
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:13.600]   We have a choir. We have our kids singing.
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:19.600]   And we will have a booth for newcomers and non-Christians who are interested in hearing more.
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:21.600]   We're going to have all of that, so invite them out.
[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:25.600]   Sunday, the 31st, we have our New Year's Eve stuff.
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:31.600]   January 7th, you guys already know this. It's been announced at ad nauseum.
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:33.600]   But please pray for this.
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:38.600]   It's not an easy thing, especially for our shepherd.
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:42.600]   Pastor Peter's going to have to preach three times every Sunday.
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:46.600]   So pray that God would protect and guard his body and his heart.
[01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:52.600]   So three services is coming, and if you want to help, we will find ways for you to help.
[01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:56.600]   So just jump in and help.
[01:51:56.600 --> 01:52:00.600]   Sunday, the 14th, the new membership class begins.
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:02.600]   There's a lot of you in here that are not members of the church.
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:08.600]   The 14th, the sign-up is going to probably go out this weekend, but just kind of keep that in mind.
[01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:11.600]   It'll be at second service at 930.
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:14.600]   Second service, 930, the new membership class will begin.
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:16.600]   In the afternoon, we have our members meeting.
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:24.600]   And February 7th, we have our Galatians Bible study part two, so please do plan for that.
[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:31.600]   Travel when we don't have Bible study, but when we have Bible study, prioritize this time to the best of your ability.
[01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:35.600]   For next week, it's our final one.
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:38.600]   So give yourselves a hand.
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:43.600]   Give your small group facilitators a thank you clap.
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:53:00.600]   It's the last five verses of Galatians chapter three, and I would encourage you guys to go back and review the first 70, the verses from chapters one through three.
[01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:06.600]   And then the preview questions, what does it mean to be baptized into Christ, to have been clothed with Christ?
[01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:08.600]   What does that mean?
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:10.600]   What is the purpose of the phrase male nor female?
[01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:12.600]   This phrase is abused today.
[01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:16.600]   A lot of people quote this, misquote this.
[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:19.600]   So what is the purpose of the phrase there is neither male nor female?
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:24.600]   In this section, what does it mean to be an heir of the promise of Abraham?
[01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:28.600]   That's going to be on the Facebook, so you don't need to copy this down.
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:30.600]   This is today's discussion.
[01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:32.600]   Who is God to you personally?
[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:34.600]   Who is Jesus Christ to you?
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:41.600]   And it sounds, it might feel like we've gone over these questions before, but this is the important question for you to answer.
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:43.600]   Okay, so think through that.
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:47.600]   What role does the law of God play in your day to day life?
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:49.600]   How eager are you to obey his law?
[01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:51.600]   And what is the motivation?
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:54.600]   Fear of wrath or desire to please?
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:57.600]   And you want to really wrestle with that and share.
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:02.600]   And number three, in what ways do you still try and get to God through a mediator?
[01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:10.600]   This passage I don't think was talking about there is now one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.
[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:13.600]   I don't think that's the, the Catholic Church abuses this.
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:15.600]   They have mediators all over the place.
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:19.600]   You have Saint Mary, you have all kinds of saints you have to pray through to get to God.
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:24.600]   But the scriptures teach us that the veil has been torn, God is now in you.
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:31.600]   Okay, so what do you do to try to still bypass what was already given to you?
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:36.600]   Four, are there any prayer requests that come from questions one to three?
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:43.600]   And the more vulnerable and honest you are with these questions, the more your group will pray.
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:53.600]   And actually more than your effort, the spiritual support and the prayers of the saints around you probably will do way more
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:55.600]   than anything that you could endeavor for yourself.
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:58.600]   Let me pray together, or let me pray and then we can dismiss.
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:05.600]   Father, help us to just appropriately respond to what we've learned.
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:12.600]   Help us to be people who understand how amazing grace really is.
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:17.600]   And help us, Lord God, to live lives of jubilee and of celebration.
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:25.600]   So would you grant us a good time of fellowship as we process through these words, through these verses, through these questions.
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:29.600]   And would you continue just to protect and bless our study.
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:31.600]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:32.600]   Amen.
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:37.600]   [Praying in Tongues]
