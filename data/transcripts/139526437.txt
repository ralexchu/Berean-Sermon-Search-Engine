[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.520]   Romans 1. We're going to continue our series and our studying of Romans chapter 1. And
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.680]   though I'm going to only be on verses 8 through 12 this morning, I kind of want to read for
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.360]   the purpose of review, starting from verse 1. So Romans chapter 1, verses 1. And I'm
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.480]   going to read all the way to verse 15. "Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.760]   apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which he promised beforehand through his prophets
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.280]   in the Holy Scriptures concerning his son, who was descended from David according to
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.200]   the flesh, and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the spirit of
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.440]   holiness by his resurrection from the dead. Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we have
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.640]   received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.940]   name among all the nations, including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.
[00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.240]   To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints, grace to you and
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.120]   peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. First, I thank my God through Jesus
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.800]   Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world. For God is
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.360]   my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of the Son, that without ceasing
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.360]   I mention you, always in my prayers asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.680]   succeed in coming to you. For I long to see you that I may impart to you some spiritual
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.480]   gift to strengthen you, that is that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith,
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.040]   both yours and mine. I want you to know, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you,
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.640]   but thus far have been prevented, in order that I may reap some harvest among you as
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.920]   well as among the rest of the Gentiles. I am under obligation both to Greeks and to
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.120]   barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish, so I am eager to preach the gospel to you
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.960]   also who are in Rome. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we ask for your blessing over this
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.900]   time. We pray that the word that goes forth will judge the thoughts and intentions of
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.040]   our heart. I pray that you would open our eyes, soften our hearts, Lord God, that your
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.120]   word will go forth and will not return until it has accomplished its purpose. In Jesus'
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:14.880]   name we pray, amen. Again, I think you and I are tremendously blessed because we have
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.880]   so many options and choices. I see so many people who have ability to travel now. Again,
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.320]   even just 30 years ago, not just in foreign countries, but even in the United States,
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.480]   to be able to go out to the East Coast or go to Hawaii, it took major planning, major
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.920]   commitment because traveling was not something that you just kind of did on a whim. Today,
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.600]   I mean the flights are cheaper. In fact, our whole church is on the point system, so you
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   can use those points to go wherever you want. And even food, especially when you travel
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.320]   to outside the country, you realize how spoiled we really are because we're used to eating
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.840]   different food almost every day. You eat Mexican food today, and tomorrow you can't have that
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.840]   because you're sick of it already. You have sushi, so tomorrow I have to have steak. You
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.280]   had Korean food, so now tomorrow I have to have Indian food. So we have all these options.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.880]   And even when you travel to rich countries, they don't really have all the options that
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.120]   you and I have. So it's a blessing, even spiritually. If you don't like this sermon, you feel like,
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.640]   "Ah, you know, Pastor Peter, he bombed today." You can go home, go on the internet, you know,
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.320]   and there's thousands of other pastors who are preaching this morning that you can download
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.400]   and listen to them. It's like, "Okay, now at least I got a good sermon this morning."
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.640]   You have all kinds of options. You don't like the temperature of this building, you go somewhere
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.600]   else, you know. I mean, in one sense, it's a blessing, but if we're not careful, that
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.520]   all these blessings that we have can easily bind us. And it easily binds us because, because
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.920]   of so many options, we become less committed. We become onlookers and kind of picking and
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.640]   choosing, like, just like if you had one thing to eat, there's nothing to think about, you
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.280]   know. I just need to eat, period. But with all the options, you're always thinking, like,
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.440]   "Should I eat this? Should I not eat that? I don't want to do this. I don't want to do
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:14.040]   that." And you and I are living in a generation where commitment is difficult. Even when you
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:21.640]   have every intention to attend this particular event. And again, this is not just our church.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.160]   I think this is just universal. People don't tend to commit to anything until the last
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.760]   minute, just in case. Who knows what's going to happen from now until three weeks from
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.320]   now. Maybe, maybe some, you know, musician's going to come into town that really want to
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.560]   attend, and I don't want to commit to that. And as a result of that, we've created a generation
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:49.000]   of onlookers, consumers. I want to weigh my options. And so this clear commitment, this
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   clear conviction has become watered down. One of the things that I really love about
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.520]   scripture is scripture is absolutely crystal clear, especially in our generation where
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.760]   everything's kind of wishy-washy. Everything's in the gray area. Where the Bible teaches
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.800]   with conviction, He speaks with authority. And that's why when the people were hearing
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.440]   Jesus they were amazed. Not simply because of the miracles, but they were amazed that
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.400]   Jesus was speaking with such clarity and conviction. And they said, "That man speaks with authority
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.360]   unlike the scribes, unlike the Pharisees. When He speaks, He speaks with clarity that
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.920]   this is right and this is wrong. Here is light and here is darkness. Here's the children
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.280]   of God, here's the children of the devil. Either you are living or you are dead. Either
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.440]   you love God or you hate Him." And He spoke with such clarity. Here's the line, "Do you
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.200]   stand with me or do you stand against me?" And again, because you and I are living in
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.380]   a generation where speaking with that kind of clarity almost always, automatically brings
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.880]   some kind of scrutiny. Not only outside the church, but oftentimes even inside the church.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.560]   When we look at Paul's ministry, he hasn't even jumped into his content yet. In the first
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.200]   chapter, the majority of it is just an introduction. All the way up to verse 17, he hasn't even
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:13.920]   jumped into the meat of his letter yet. But he's introducing himself. So the first part
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.800]   of the sermon, the first part of the message when he said, "Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus,
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.120]   called to be an apostle," he talked about his identity. His identity crystal clear, that
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:29.200]   I am a slave of Jesus Christ. There's no in-between. He's not a part-time worker, he's a slave
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.880]   of Jesus Christ. He was an apostle set apart for the Gospel ministry. He knew exactly who
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.480]   he was. Not only did he know who he was, he knew exactly what the message was. And we
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:45.320]   talked about that last week. How this message, this Gospel was given from the prophets, from
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:51.280]   of old. This wasn't just something that Jesus just brought a new thing to a new generation.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.320]   He said, "This is at the core of who God is." God has been preparing from the beginning
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.880]   of the fall of man until the end of time, that this is at the core of his heart. So
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:09.200]   when we talk about the Gospel, we're not talking about a good news. There's all kinds of other
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.800]   good news. We just believe that the good news is the best news. No, what Paul is saying,
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:24.160]   this is the news. This is the story. This is at the core of God. So Paul knew exactly
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.560]   what it was. This is at the core of God. He said, in fact, this Gospel is about Jesus
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:36.000]   Christ and the whole purpose of this Gospel is to bring about obedience of faith. Today
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.840]   and for the next couple of weeks, we're going to be talking about Paul's ministry. We're
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.240]   going to be talking about his heart. We're going to be talking about what his intention
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.160]   is. Why does he want to come here? What is the goal of why he's writing this letter?
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.840]   It's all contained in the next maybe about 10 verses. So we'll take maybe at least two
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:59.200]   weeks, maybe three weeks just unpacking this to see, again, have a greater glimpse of Paul,
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:05.320]   his identity, his message and his ministry. So as we jump in this morning, there's one
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.880]   clear thing that I want to emphasize this morning and hopefully at the end of the sermon
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:16.400]   that again, there's one point that I'm trying to make is that for Apostle Paul, his ministry
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:24.920]   was very, very personal. This was not just his job. You could see even by the way he
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:32.640]   addresses God, he's not just talking to the God or a God or the most powerful God. He
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.320]   uses a very intimate word and he says, "My God." Look with me in verse eight. First,
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:44.000]   I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you. Now, when you read this, you can just
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.840]   kind of read it and just pass by it. It's like, okay, you know, I think my God and just
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:55.240]   a part of the introduction. But you see in Paul's letters that oftentimes when he talks
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.920]   about God, he's a very personal God. I give thanks to my God always for you in 1 Corinthians
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:07.920]   1.4. Philippians 1.3, I thank my God in all of my remembrance of you. Philippians 4.19,
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.760]   and my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches and glory in Christ
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:18.840]   Jesus. Philemon 4, I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers. Over and over
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:26.000]   again, he's not referring to a God or the God, he's talking about my God. Now, why is
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.760]   this important? And again, this is connected to everything else that he's going to say.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:39.920]   If the God that we worship is not a personal God, he's just the God, he's just a holy,
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:47.920]   holy, holy God. And everything else that we do easily becomes drudgery, just easily becomes
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:56.600]   something that we have to do, it becomes a job. We do not present an impersonal God.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:03.600]   He didn't give us a set of facts for us to regurgitate to other people. See, it's not
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:11.320]   good news until it is good news to you. If I said to you this morning, "Somebody won
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:17.880]   the lottery," which is true, how does that affect you? It doesn't affect you at all.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:23.160]   So what? People win lottery every day. What if I told you that somebody in your local
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:29.440]   neighborhood won the lottery? Oh, really? You know, and you're kind of curious, right?
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:36.120]   Who is that person? Maybe have a better effect, but maybe not personal. If I say somebody,
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.360]   somebody in this room won the lottery, then you're going to be all curious, "Who won the
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:49.480]   lottery? Are they going to tide that? Are we moving now?" Right? It's going to affect
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.440]   you. What if I said somebody in your family won the lottery? Like, "How much are they
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.640]   going to give me?" Right? If I said somebody, if I said you won the lottery, so you have
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.360]   a different effect depending upon how personal it is. But if it's not, if it's not personal,
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:11.200]   we say, "Somebody won the lottery." Right? "Somebody won the lottery." Okay. That's good.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:16.800]   I'm happy for them. Not really, but you know, I'm happy for them. The good news isn't good
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:23.720]   news until it is personal. We don't spread the gospel of a bunch of information about
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:31.160]   some theological truth that's true to the world until it is true to us. You know, I
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.760]   don't know if those of you who've ever worked at telemarketing, but if you ever work for
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:40.080]   telemarketing, first thing that they train you to do is to have a little paragraph they
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.880]   want you to memorize. And they literally want you to say this word for word. And again,
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.760]   they do this for two reasons. One, because they've tested out that these are things that
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.720]   actually has effect and they see that these are things that you need to say and these
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.840]   are the things that trigger people to make decisions. Another reason why they do that,
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:04.840]   for legal purposes, that you need to say certain words or certain phrases to legally be able
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.600]   to say, "Oh, we're going to switch your phone company," or, "We're going to sell you this."
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.880]   Or if you exaggerate something, right? And legally, like they find out like, "Oh, you
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.600]   said something you shouldn't say." And then you turn that in, they'll reject that because
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:22.280]   legally they can't switch their company. So for those two reasons, you have to go and
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:27.760]   say these things perfectly. See, the gospel is not a set of facts that have been given
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:35.080]   to us where He says, "Here it is," and regurgitate this information to other people. If you examine
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:40.120]   Paul, and it's not just Paul, but if you examine the authors of the books of the New Testament,
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:46.220]   it was very personal. They weren't just telling, "You know, this is what I heard in my dreams
[00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:53.040]   and now I'm going to tell you." Right? They were personally deeply affected. He wasn't
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:58.800]   just proclaiming some impersonal God, a set of information that's good news to the whole
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:07.960]   world. He says, "My God, I thank my God whom I serve with my whole heart." That's why when
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.720]   Jesus asked His disciples before we went to the cross, you know, we often ask the question
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.880]   like, "Why did He spend three years?" You know, in reality it was less than three years,
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:23.160]   but why did He commit three years to ministry? Couldn't He have just gone to the cross? Right?
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:28.760]   I think the primary reason why He spent three years with His disciples was to give them
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:33.980]   conviction of who He was. So when He asked the question, "I know what the world says
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:39.000]   who I am. Who do you say I am?" And that was the most important question. I think that
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.320]   was at the core of Jesus' discipleship. To bring them to a point, "I know what they say,
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:52.160]   but we say, 'You're the Son of God. You are the Christ.'" And even as people were turning
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.320]   away when Jesus said, "Are you going to turn from Me too?" And remember the disciples,
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:04.300]   "Where are we going to go? You have the words of life." The question that we, again, repeatedly
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:10.800]   have to ask ourselves is not, "What does our church stand for?" You know, I hear people
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.200]   say all the time, "Oh, you know, our church is involved with mission. Our church is involved
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.680]   with this." And we just kind of vicariously think that we're living in obedience because
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:27.620]   our church, you know, our pastor, or our leaders. But who do you say He is? Who is He to you?
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:35.280]   Not to the church, but to you? See, with Apostle Paul, again, I've highlighted a few verses,
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:41.320]   but one of the things that you'll recognize with Apostle Paul, it was extremely personal.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.960]   Not just in the way that he addressed God. If you keep reading, he says, "I thank my
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.120]   God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:54.460]   For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son." So, not
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:59.960]   only is God a personal God, he says His serving is in His Spirit. What he means by that is
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.420]   not saying, like, physically He's doing this, and spiritually there's something else going
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:09.480]   on. It's very, actually very common what he is saying. He's saying that my service to
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:16.280]   Him is not just external. I'm serving Him wholeheartedly. He is completely committed.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:24.440]   That's what he means. He's serving God externally and internally. See, it was extremely personal
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:30.160]   to him. It wasn't just a job where he checked in and said, "Well, what do I do from 9 to
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:35.160]   5?" You know, you date entry with this, you meet these patients, and you do this and that,
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.960]   and then you clock out at the end. Right? What Paul is saying is my service to God is
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:46.000]   wholehearted, complete, inside and out. That's exactly what he says in Ephesians 6, 5-6.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.560]   "Slaves, obey your masters with fear and trembling, with a sincere heart." Not just to check off
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.040]   the list. Right? So, "Oh, I read my Bible, you know, I memorize Scripture, and I'm serving
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:04.680]   the church, so externally I'm doing everything." He says, "Not by way of eye service, just
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.760]   so that when people are watching you say, 'Oh, I did it.'" Not simply by eye service,
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:17.200]   as people pleasers, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart. Right?
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:23.220]   If you ever see anybody who is working and laboring for the Lord, and complaining and
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:28.960]   grumbling at the same time, you know that that service is not going to last long. At
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:34.440]   some point, there's a breaking point. At some point, it's not going to be enough. See, Apostle
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:38.400]   Paul, what he's saying is, "I serve my God." And again, it's very personal to him. "I'm
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:44.240]   serving my God wholeheartedly in my spirit." Because there are certain things that you
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:51.600]   just absolutely cannot do half-hearted. You can watch a movie half-heartedly, which 99%
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.920]   of the time, that's usually me. You know, I'm usually not that engaged when I'm watching
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:01.560]   movies because I fall asleep probably about 70-80% of the time. Especially if I'm home.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:07.120]   Esther and I, it's a running joke. Like, who's going to fall asleep first? Right? We have
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:11.000]   a movie night. "Oh, let's go get a movie." And then we're just kind of watching each
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.800]   other to see who falls asleep first. Right? And if we missed it, so what? You know? I
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.800]   fell asleep on, you know that Up movie? Some of you guys who watch that. I fell asleep
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:28.640]   at that point when the wife dies. Yeah. And I woke up, and he's chasing some strange bird.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.520]   And I didn't understand the whole movie. Like, why? Why is he here? Why is he chasing this
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.120]   bird? And then Esther had to, like, "You missed it? How can you miss that?" It's like, "Ah,
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.080]   so it's just a movie." Right? I understood later why everybody liked it. But, you know,
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:47.120]   there's certain things that you can do half-hearted, and there isn't a huge consequence because
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:53.200]   it's just entertainment. I've seen some of you guys take the bar. Especially the California
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:59.640]   bar. Supposedly, it's supposed to be the hardest bar that you can take. You know? That's not
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.040]   something you go in half-hearted. You don't just say, it's like, "Oh, you know what? I
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.780]   forgot to study. You know, I'm supposed to take the bar tomorrow. You know, three days
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:14.040]   of eight-hour tests. And I'm just going to cram it Sunday night." You know what I mean?
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:18.520]   You have to prepare for that. You don't just half-heartedly walk into that. You know it's
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:24.000]   coming, and you have to schedule all your life. You know what I mean? If it's happening
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.120]   in June, starting from January, you're going to have to plan who you can meet, who you
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.680]   can't meet, when you can go out, when you can't go out, when you're going to sleep.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.160]   You have to plan all that out because you know that you can't just casually walk into
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:40.740]   that. I've seen some of you guys take the CPA exam. I was just surprised how hard that
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.720]   thing was. Initially, I thought, "Jeez, not that, you know." Initially, I thought, "Whatever."
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.120]   When I started seeing everybody taking it, it's like, "Wow, this is no joke." You know,
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.920]   you fail one, and they give you a certain period of time, you got to take all of it.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.040]   And I know some of you guys are preparing, some of you guys have already taken it. You
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:02.600]   don't just enter into that half-heartedly, right? You don't start a business half-heartedly.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.280]   You don't just say, "Hey, you know, I saved up $200,000, and I want to invest in the business."
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:13.000]   I'll just do that one. You know what I mean? You don't just do that. It's like 95% of the
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.680]   businesses fail. You might as well just throw your money away. You go in there, you make
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:22.880]   sure you have a business outline, what you're going to do, you know, and how long it's going
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:27.360]   to take for you to make a profit. You go into all of that thoroughly prepared. Same thing
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:32.120]   with marriage. You don't just walk down a street and fall in love and say, "We got married
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.360]   tomorrow." You know what I mean? You get a lot of prayer and thought into it because
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:41.240]   you're going to be connected with this person the rest of your life. A lot of prayer, counseling
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.800]   goes into making this judgment. There are certain things that you can do half-heartedly,
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:52.480]   and there are certain things that you absolutely cannot do half-heartedly. Scripture tells
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:20:01.080]   us clearly that following Christ is not something you can do half-heartedly. You cannot, you
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:06.280]   can't go in and become a lawyer and say, "Ah, you know, I did some okay, or some I didn't."
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:12.640]   Either you pass it or you didn't pass it. "Ah, that guy got a C-." So he's a C- lawyer.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:19.280]   "Ah, that guy got a CPA, but he didn't pass all his exams, so he's good in the beginning,
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.320]   but it just never balances out at the end. But he's kind of a CPA." Either you are or
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:32.080]   you're not. The Scripture says to count the costs. What does it mean to be a follower
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:37.560]   of Jesus Christ? And the sad thing is, in where you and I live, that that cost isn't
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:45.040]   calculated until a lot of times way into our Christian life. We don't really think about
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:49.280]   it until we start working and we see the consequence of what it means to be a genuine follower
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:55.360]   of Christ. We start thinking the consequence of when we get married and have kids and making
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:00.880]   decisions that's going to alter the projections of our life, and then we start thinking about,
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:08.360]   "Wow, you know, this is the cost of following Christ." In Jeremiah 29, 13, it says, "You
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:15.080]   will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart." Personal relationship
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:20.920]   with Christ is not something that we can do casually. You don't casually walk into the
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:29.200]   presence of God. You don't casually commune with this holy God. I remember one of the
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:37.160]   best sermons that I heard about prayer and why prayer is so difficult for so many people.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:42.520]   And again, it was so contrary to what I heard prior to his preaching that it really made
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:48.120]   a huge impact on me. And his main point of his sermon on prayer was that prayer is the
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:52.800]   most difficult thing that a Christian can do. And when you really think about it, it's
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:57.160]   like, "Why is it so difficult?" Like, reading the Bible, you have to actually set a time,
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:00.080]   read the Bible. Some of you guys are better readers than others. And then you need to
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:04.600]   actually think about it. You need to comprehend it. You need to know what it says, and then
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.720]   you get lost. And, you know, so it requires a lot more work to study the Bible. But then
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.680]   prayer is just close your eyes and hear God, and you just kind of have some thoughts about
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:17.280]   God. Why is that so hard? In fact, you hear, say, "Oh, I pray when I run. Oh, at the gym
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:23.440]   when I'm lifting weights, I'm praying." You know? And sometimes when we eat, we pray,
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:30.480]   "Thank you, Lord, for this." You know, we thank God while we're eating, right? It's
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:37.320]   so casual. But what Martin Luther, Lord Jones was saying was, "Prayer is communion with
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:43.360]   the Holy, Holy, Holy God." To come into His presence casually, and that's why prayer is
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:50.320]   so frustrating for so many people, because it is looked upon so casually. See, prayer
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:56.920]   requires a commitment. In Psalm 119, verse 2, it says, "Blessed are those who keep His
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:02.520]   testimonies, who seek Him with their whole heart." God is not somebody that you're going
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:07.360]   to just casually walk around and then bump into. It's like, "Oh, I met God today." He
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:13.880]   says, "You will seek Me and find Me when you seek Me with all your heart, when you have
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:20.280]   made a commitment that this is what you want." Even in your prayers, just casually, "Oh,
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.240]   Lord, you know, this is where I am. Can you please help me?" "Amen, amen." So you feel
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:29.200]   like, "I did it." Right? "I said it. I put in my time. I prayed. How come God's not answering
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:36.960]   my prayer?" Because the Scripture says, "When you seek Me with all your heart, I will be
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.880]   found by you." So how much of our prayers ain't affected because we haven't made up
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:50.400]   our mind that this is absolutely essential to me? How much of it is just so casual? And
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:54.600]   if we, like a magic formula, if you just say the right words, abracadabra, and if you put
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:58.000]   in the right amount of change into a vending machine, somehow something's going to come
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.480]   out. See, with Apostle Paul, you know, it was very personal to him. Even his work, even
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:12.080]   his labor, he said, "With all his heart." We can't stand before God and say, "Lord,
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:19.040]   I want to know Your will just in case I decide to obey." See, that decision has to be made
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:24.320]   before you come before God and ask God, "What do You desire?" We can't come before God and
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:29.640]   say, "Lord, I want to know Your will. I'm not sure if I'm ready to commit yet. I'm not
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:36.200]   sure. I want You to answer my prayer, but I'm not sure if I'm committed to this yet."
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:41.800]   We can ask for revival, but revival means that God's going to examine our lives. The
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.360]   Holy Spirit's going to come and examine every aspect of our lives because He's going to
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.840]   be there. He's not going to just walk into any room. He's going to walk into rooms that
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:25:01.080]   are prepared for Him. Is my devotion to God absolutely committed? Even in worship, you
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:06.400]   know, we can walk in so casually. Like if I go to sleep on Sunday and Saturday and wake
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.840]   up in the morning, put on clothes, you know, and come in, you know, and the quality of
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:17.680]   the worship depends upon how much time I spent in prayer, how much time I prepared, how many
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.240]   good illustrations that I've given to you, and how engaged I can be in the way that I
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:25.880]   talk. So I say, "Oh, you know, he did a good job. I was blessed. Oh, he didn't do a good
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.760]   job. The worship team, did they pick the right songs? Did they prepare enough? Did they get
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:39.400]   us to focus?" And how much of that is dependent upon what we have brought into the room, that
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:47.520]   we have committed, that this is important to me. See, God is not somebody that we can
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:53.560]   pursue casually. He made it absolutely clear. You can come and put in your time. You can
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:59.880]   give to the church. You can, you know, socially, you know, build relationships. But to meet
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:07.160]   with Him, to have Him, to have revival in your life is not something that happens casually.
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:15.120]   It's not something that simply happens because I've prepared. See, you can't even serve Him
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:22.120]   half-heartedly. You can't. Romans chapter 12, verse 1. Paul says, "I appeal to you,
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:26.800]   therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, in view of this mercy." Eleven chapters of
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:33.120]   exposition of His grace and love. In view of this tremendous mercy that we have received,
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:39.880]   he says, "Present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:46.520]   is your spiritual worship." Now, let's examine for a minute what he means by "living sacrifice."
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:56.040]   Because a Jew who heard the word "sacrifice" meant, what did it mean to him? Death. Because
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:00.680]   an animal wasn't taken to the temple and then let it run around for a few minutes and then
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:08.240]   taken back home. An animal who was taken to the altar was slaughtered and was dead. His
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:13.280]   life ended. So when Paul says, "In view of this mercy, in view of this tremendous gift
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:17.680]   that we have in Christ, let not just give our offering, not just give our animals, give
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:27.400]   your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual act of worship."
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:34.720]   So what is he saying? Even our sacrifices, even our serving cannot be done casually.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:39.400]   You will seek me and find me if you seek me with all your heart. Have you made up your
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:44.040]   mind that this is the most important thing in your life? That's why he says, you know,
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.120]   the letter to the Laodicean church, notice carefully what he says to the Laodicean church
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:54.400]   in Revelations 4. "I know your works." He's not just talking about your heart, but he
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.800]   says, "I know your works and what you are doing. I know that you are neither cold nor
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:04.000]   hot." You're not, in other words, what is he saying? You're uncommitted. You're doing
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.240]   stuff, but you're uncommitted. You're giving, but it's uncommitted. You're crying out to
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:14.120]   God, but it's uncommitted. Neither hot or cold. I wish you were either hot or cold.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:19.000]   You make up your mind, right? And isn't that what Joshua was saying at the end where Herod
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.840]   was quoting? Because you keep tottering between this and that, right? If serving the Lord
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:30.520]   is a burden to you, then go serve what you want to serve. Stop teetering between one
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:35.680]   and the other. See, that's the rebuke that the Laodicean church got because they were
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:41.120]   uncommitted. Because you were lukewarm, neither hot or cold, I will spit you out of my mouth.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:47.520]   So, you know, an uncommitted worship, uncommitted prayer, uncommitted service is unacceptable
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:55.000]   to God. We can't casually come to God. We can't casually pray. We can't casually meet
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.240]   God. When you hear the Gospel, the first thing that we need to ask ourselves is, "Is this
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:07.080]   true?" See, you can't even preach the Gospel casually. You can't, how can you possibly
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:14.400]   preach the Gospel casually? I remember, some of you guys remember, you know, when Rita,
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.640]   she's no longer a student, she's married and has a child in China, but some of you guys
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:22.520]   remember how we were praying for her for years. And there's some people in this room that
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:28.240]   played an important role in seeing Rita come to Christ. But I remember right when she was
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:33.440]   on the verge of becoming a Christian, we went out to visit her. And I remember Rita having
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.360]   dinner with her and she was asking, this is before she became a Christian, she said, "You
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:41.920]   know, all of my friends are telling me to stop meeting with you. And the reason why
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:45.680]   is because they tell me that the only reason why you're here is because you want her to
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:51.260]   convert to Christianity. And if you are not interested in Christianity, they're not interested
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:57.620]   in being your friends." You know, and she said, "Is that true?" So I remember sitting
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:01.020]   and thinking through that and I said, "Well, I better answer this correctly or else this
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:05.540]   will be the end." Right? And all the years of laboring and the people that have been
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:09.220]   meeting up with her. And so I said, "Okay, you know, I should be honest with her." And
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:16.260]   I said, "Rita, they're absolutely true. Your friends are right. They observe correctly.
[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:20.420]   You know, and I know you're not dumb. You know, we come out here for that reason. We're
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.820]   not here to make money. And it's pretty obvious we're not here to make money. We're not here
[00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:28.820]   because of the great weather, because it's not good. You know, we're not here for the
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:35.320]   great food. We're here because of you." She said, "What kind of friend would I be? If
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:41.220]   I, whether you believe it or not, I believe that the only way of salvation is through
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:47.220]   the blood of Christ. And as long as I'm your friend, there will never be a time where I
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:54.820]   will not be working to bring you to Christ." And if you, if you ask me that question, you're
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:58.140]   absolutely, that's why we're here. That's why we're spending thousands of dollars coming
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.300]   here. That's why people are packing up their bags and moving to a foreign country so that
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:06.620]   you can hear the Gospel. And that's the only reason why we're here. Now, to make a story
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:12.460]   short, you know, obviously a few months after that, she committed her life to Christ. But
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:20.700]   that is true for every one of us. Gospel preaching cannot be done casually. It is not a set of
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:26.040]   information that we are to regurgitate and to hand off to other people. This is not a
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:30.860]   message where you have a scripted thing that you memorize and you just pass out to other
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:36.700]   people. Until you are convicted, until this is your God, until this message is yours,
[00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:45.260]   until you've been deeply affected, you cannot be effective. For Apostle Paul, this ministry
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:49.820]   was very personal. And that's why the third and final thing that we see is that even in
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:55.460]   his prayer, you can see how intimately entangled he is with this ministry. Remember, Paul never
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:00.220]   met these people. Paul never met these people. They weren't friends. They weren't family
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:03.700]   friends. They weren't no business contacts. He's never met these people. And that's why
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:08.020]   he's writing this letter. And yet, he's writing this letter. He says, "I thank my God for
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:13.220]   you. Because your faith is being proclaimed throughout the whole world, I long to be with
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:19.460]   you." Now, is he just saying it because that's just what Christians say? You know how Christians
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:27.340]   say, "Oh, I'm sick. I'll pray for you." And some of you pray, and some of you may not pray.
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:33.180]   But that's what we say. That's what we say. It's like, "Oh, hi. Bye. We'll pray for you."
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:40.020]   Is that what Paul is doing? Is this just something that a Christian says, right, and tells people?
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:48.420]   And if not, if he actually means it, is he really rejoicing? Is he really longing to
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:53.380]   see them? I'm absolutely convinced that that's exactly what he's saying. In fact, he says
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:58.860]   that over and over again to all the other churches. So, humanly speaking, we can look
[00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:03.100]   at that. We have a hard time praying for people that we don't personally know. Now, when was
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:09.260]   the last time you really pleaded with God for lost souls that you've never met? It's
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.060]   much easier when you've met them, right? Or you know them personally. So, we tend to pray
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:17.900]   for ourselves, our family members, our good friends, our co-workers. These are people
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:24.500]   he's never met. The reason why Paul was so personally engaged was because he sacrificed
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:32.180]   everything. He sacrificed everything to bring the Gospel to them. So, he rejoiced when he
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:37.660]   saw the Gospel bearing fruit. That's what he says in 2 Timothy 2.10. I endure everything
[00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:43.620]   for the sake of the elect. And everything that Paul is talking about is beating. It's
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:50.300]   confiscation of property. Risking his life, spending nights and months and years in jail.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:55.140]   He said he's risking all of that so that you may come to Christ. And that's why he says
[00:33:55.140 --> 00:34:00.640]   in Philippians that some people are preaching Christ out of envy, but I rejoice. Whatever
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:06.060]   your motive is that Christ is being preached, that the Gospel is being spread. That's how
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:12.300]   personally involved he was with this message. And again in 1 Corinthians 9.22, I became
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:20.300]   all things to all people by all means that I may save some. When Rita came to Christ,
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:24.740]   you know the people who rejoice the most are the people who talk to her, who prayed for
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:30.020]   her, who are concerned for her, who share the Gospel with her. And I know the other
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:37.020]   people rejoice too, but the people who committed, people who sacrificed, people who are engaged
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:41.540]   in this work. When we heard that Rita came to Christ, remember that day when she sent
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:48.140]   an email and I read her email? And we, I'm literally, I mean it was momentary revival.
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:54.220]   Right? We were just so elated that she came to Christ. And even those who didn't know
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:59.820]   her personally, those who prayed with us in the church, you know, it felt like a family
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:09.900]   member that came to Christ. See, Paul is spiritually, emotionally, socially engaged in this work.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:15.900]   It wasn't a half-hearted commitment. He was willing to die to preach the Gospel. And that's
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:23.040]   why Apostle Paul, when he says, "I rejoice," that these aren't just words. This is a testimony
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:29.220]   of an individual who's given everything to bring the Gospel to the lost. See, someone
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:36.140]   who is not engaged in the work, it's just news. If you haven't been engaged in praying
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:41.740]   for the lost, when you hear that somebody comes to Christ, it's just news. We talk about
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:44.380]   somebody, you know, like, "Oh, somebody became a Christian and they're going to give their
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:49.180]   testimony." Right? If you're not personally engaged in that, it's like, "Oh, you know,
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:55.220]   your mind tells you you should rejoice, because the Scripture says that. Your mind tells you,
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:36:01.580]   'I should be excited. I should be happy. I should be rejoicing to hear their testimony.'"
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:09.300]   That's what your mind tells you, but your heart is not there, because you're not engaged.
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:15.080]   Your sacrifice, your worship to God, there's no sacrifice involved. You haven't pleaded
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:20.660]   on their behalf. You haven't given up anything important for the Gospel ministry. So when
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:25.940]   somebody comes to Christ, unless it is somebody in your family, somebody that you know personally,
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:32.700]   we don't understand, like, "You rejoice over a bunch of these strangers." Paul was absolutely
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:40.220]   committed. Not only was he committed in rejoicing, I mean, it hit him personally when they weren't
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:45.160]   committed. 2 Corinthians 11, 28, it says, "And apart from all the other things, all
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:51.500]   the other sufferings, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches."
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:58.280]   Why would he? Why would he be so personally affected that other people were not thriving
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:04.500]   in their faith? Because he invested so much in spreading the Gospel. He invested so much
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:09.380]   in discipling them. He invested so much in praying for them, night and day. So he rejoiced
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:13.660]   when they were doing well, just like your children. When your children do well, you
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:18.180]   rejoice. When they don't do well, you grieve, because you've invested so much of your life
[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:26.140]   in them. So, Apostle Paul, his ministry, his relationship with Christ, his preaching the
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:35.260]   Gospel, his building up of the churches, his discipleship, all of this was extremely personal.
[00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:42.940]   See, God is not somebody that you can follow casually. Uncommitted. You can come to church
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:50.740]   uncommitted. You can serve the church uncommitted. You can give uncommitted. You can fellowship
[00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:58.380]   uncommitted. You can go to foreign countries for short-term missions, uncommitted. You
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:07.620]   can do all kinds of stuff uncommitted. But you cannot seek Him and find Him uncommitted.
[00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:15.420]   You will never know Him uncommitted. You will never know the power of prayer uncommitted.
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:21.660]   You will never experience revival uncommitted. You will never know the joy of bringing a
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:30.380]   loss to Christ uncommitted. You will never weep for the loss uncommitted. You will never
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:39.660]   grieve and cry out to God for the lost world uncommitted. See, Apostle Paul, to him it
[00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:46.900]   meant everything. That's why he didn't just pray. He cried out. When he prayed, he prayed
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:52.300]   for open doors. He prayed for open doors. And then he said when the door gets open,
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:57.060]   he prayed that he would have boldness to preach. And then he said not only for that to happen,
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:02.580]   but to pray rapidly so that as many people can come to Christ. His whole purpose of writing
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:07.180]   this letter is to prepare them because he was ready to pack up his bag and go out to
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:14.580]   Spain. Again, my prayer for all of us is that you and I live in a generation where being
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:22.060]   committed is a foreign thing. It's a foreign thing in our generation to be committed to
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:29.100]   anything. The best commitment is, well, you know, I'll do my best. Like I said, there
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:33.780]   are certain things that you can do uncommitted. You can watch a movie uncommitted. You might
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:38.260]   even go to school uncommitted because you're not completely sold out. You might actually
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:44.060]   even maybe go to work uncommitted. He's like, I have to pay the bills. But you cannot be
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:49.380]   uncommitted in your walk with Christ. You can come to church all your life and completely
[00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:56.180]   miss him. If you can take a few minutes to pray with me as I asked the praise team to
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:40:00.140]   come up and lead us in worship. And again, to come before the Lord, to examine Apostle
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:05.340]   Paul and his commitment in his life. Who am I? Where do I stand with Christ? What is the
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:11.860]   message that I'm so committed to? And this personal commitment of Paul to ministry, to
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:18.140]   our God. Is he my God or is he the God of this church? Let's take a few minutes to come
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:21.700]   before the Lord and ask the Lord to bring renewal and revival in our hearts as we seek
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:21.900]   him.
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.740]   (papers rustling)
