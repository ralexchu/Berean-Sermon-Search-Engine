[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.920]   If this is your first Sunday at the church,
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.920]   we do have a welcome table in the back of the courtyard,
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.920]   and I'm sure you might've passed it.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.420]   So if you wanna find out more information about the church
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.420]   and to see how you can get plugged in,
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.920]   please do visit that table.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.420]   I do have a couple of announcements for you
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:02.920]   that are pretty important,
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.420]   especially for the next couple of weeks.
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.920]   This week, we don't have Bible study at church
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.420]   for the Wednesday or for the home groups.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.920]   Instead, this coming Friday,
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.920]   we're gonna have all church praise and prayer at 7.30.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.920]   So it's a good time for all of us to get together.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.420]   So please do make an effort to come out.
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.920]   Today, we're gonna be taking a special offering
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.420]   for the Dropbox Ministry,
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.420]   or the Baby Box Ministry in Korea.
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.920]   Pastor Lee will be joining us, actually,
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.420]   next Sunday for service.
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.420]   And then in the afternoon at 1.30,
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.920]   we're gonna have a time to give him an opportunity
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.920]   to share what we can do, just a Q&A time.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.420]   So if you haven't signed up for that,
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.920]   please do sign up online.
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.920]   And if you have questions to submit, please do so.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.920]   And if you're part of the Women's Ministry,
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.420]   you know that you guys are gonna watch
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.420]   the entire documentary next month.
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.920]   So all of that is in the announcements.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.920]   If you're new to the church and not a member,
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.920]   but you want to become a member,
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.420]   our eight-week courses are starting up again
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.920]   on October 2nd.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.920]   So the sign-ups are available, so please do sign up.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.920]   And if you have anything exceptional
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.920]   that you need to discuss, talk to Pastor Nate Kwok.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:21.420]   Monday, October 31st of next month,
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.920]   we're gonna have trunk formation
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.420]   and we're gonna fill our courtyard
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.920]   with a bunch of booths and trunks with candies and prizes.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.920]   So if you have a trunk that you want to decorate
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.420]   and make it into a game,
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:36.420]   or you have donations of prizes, of toys, of candy,
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.920]   please do send that in.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:42.920]   If you have any questions, contact Esther Leung.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.920]   All right?
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.420]   We're gonna take a time of offering.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.920]   And as a reminder, please do try to send in your offering
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.920]   electronically through Zelle, if that's your means.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.920]   Otherwise, we do have an offering basket
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.920]   somewhere over there in the back.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:56.420]   Okay?
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.920]   Let me pray for us,
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.920]   and then we'll continue with our service.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:05.920]   Father, we pray that as we gather here this morning,
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.920]   that we would remember that you are the one
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.920]   that we come to honor.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.920]   You are the audience of one,
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.420]   and you are center here.
[00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.920]   And so we pray that as we sing, as we give,
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.420]   as we hear your word, and as we fellowship after,
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.920]   Lord, would you remain very much at the center
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.420]   of all that we do this day
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.420]   for your glory, for our rest.
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.420]   So we thank you, Lord, and thank you for entrusting us
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.920]   to steward the resources that you've given us.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.920]   And we pray that the offering that we give,
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.420]   you would use it really to build your kingdom
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.420]   in and through your people.
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.420]   In Jesus' name we pray.

[00:20:55.420 --> 00:21:01.420]   [music]

[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:37.420]   [music]
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.420]   Brothers and sisters, let's all rise together
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.420]   as we sing these songs.
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:50.420]   [music]
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.420]   We won't fear.
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:55.420]   We won't fear the battle.
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.420]   We won't fear the night.
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:02.420]   We will walk the valley with you by our side.
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.420]   You will go before us.
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.420]   You will lead the way.
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:12.420]   We have found a refuge only you can take.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:13.420]   Sing.
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:14.420]   Sing.
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.420]   Sing.
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.420]   Sing.
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.420]   Sing with joy now.
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.420]   Our God is for us.
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:25.420]   The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.420]   Raise your voice now.
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.420]   No love is greater.
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.420]   Who can stand against this?
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.420]   For our God is for us.
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:38.420]   [music]
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:42.420]   Even when, even when I stumble,
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.420]   even when I fall,
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.420]   even when I turn back,
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:49.420]   still your love is sure.
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.420]   You will not abandon.
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.420]   You will not forsake.
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:59.420]   You will cheer me on with never-ending grace.
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.420]   Sing with joy now.
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:04.420]   Our God is for us.
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:08.420]   The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress.
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.420]   Raise your voice now.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.420]   No love is greater.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.420]   Who can stand against this?
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.420]   For our God is for us.
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:23.420]   [music]
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:24.420]   Sing it out, neither of us.
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.420]   [music]
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.420]   Neither high nor low,
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.420]   neither high nor low,
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.420]   neither high nor low,

[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.420]   neither high nor low,
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.420]   neither high nor low.

[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.420]   Sing it out, neither of us.
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.420]   [music]

[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.420]   neither high nor low.
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.420]   [music]
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.420]   Sing it out, neither of us.
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.420]   [music]
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.420]   Sing it out, neither of us.
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.420]   [music]
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:40.420]   Sing it out, neither of us.
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.420]   [music]
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:46.420]   Sing it out, neither of us.
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.420]   [music]
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.420]   Sing it out, neither of us.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.420]   [music]
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:25:06.420]   [music]
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:23.420]   The uncreated One,
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:29.420]   the author of salvation,
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:36.420]   who wrote the laws of space and time,
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:42.420]   and fashioned worlds to His desire.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.420]   The one whom Angelos revered
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:50.420]   hung the stars like chandeliers,
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.420]   numbered every grain of sand,
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:57.420]   knows the heart of every man.
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.420]   He is King forever,
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:04.420]   He is King forever,
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:08.420]   He is King forevermore.
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.420]   [music]
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.420]   [music]
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:27.420]   God of fortress and of strength,
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:34.420]   the Rock on which we can declare,
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:40.420]   majesty, His majesty,
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.420]   His power and authority.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:50.420]   He's unshaken, unshaken by the schemes of man,
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:54.420]   never changing, great I Am.
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:57.420]   Kingdoms rise and kingdoms fall,
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:01.420]   He is faithful through it all.
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.420]   Crown Him King forever,
[00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:08.420]   Crown Him King forever,
[00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:12.420]   Crown Him King forevermore.
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.420]   [music]
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:25.420]   Sing mighty God,
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:31.420]   mighty God in mortal flesh,
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:37.420]   forsaken by a traitor's kiss.
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:43.420]   The curse of sin and centuries
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:50.420]   did pierce the lowly Prince of Peace.
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.420]   Lifted high the sinless man,
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:57.420]   crucified the spotless Lamb,
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.420]   buried by the sons of man,
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:04.420]   rescued by the Father's hand.
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:07.420]   To reign as King forever,
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:11.420]   reign as King forever,
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:18.420]   reign as King forevermore.
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:24.420]   King eternal, God of grace,
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:30.420]   we crown You with the highest praise.
[00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:36.420]   Heaven shouts and saints adore
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:40.420]   Your holy, holy, holy Lord.
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.420]   What joy, Lord.
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:46.420]   What joy in everlasting life.
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:50.420]   All is love and faith aside.
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:53.420]   Justice rolls and praises rise
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:57.420]   at the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.420]   King of kings forever,
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:04.420]   King of kings forever,
[00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:08.420]   King of kings forevermore.
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.420]   Yes, He's the King.
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.420]   King of kings forever,
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:18.420]   King of kings forever,
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:22.420]   King of kings forevermore.
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:37.420]   [music]
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.420]   Amen. You may be seated.
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:45.420]   [music]
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.420]   All right, would you join with me in prayer
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:51.420]   before we hear just the proclamation of God's Word?
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.420]   [clears throat]
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:57.420]   Father, we are gathered here this morning
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:01.420]   just to hear what You have to say.
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:05.420]   And I pray, Father, that You would stir our hearts
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:10.420]   and that You would cause them just to long to know You more.
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:15.420]   So would You bear fruit through the preaching of Your Word?
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.420]   And I pray, Father God, that You would be honored
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.420]   through the application in our lives.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.420]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:27.420]   The passage today is going to be Deuteronomy chapter 34,
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:31.420]   and I'm going to read for you verses 3 to 12.
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:40.420]   Deuteronomy chapter 34, verses 3 to 12, or 4 to 12.
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.420]   "Then the Lord said to him,
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:48.420]   'This is the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.420]   saying, 'I will give it to your descendants,
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.420]   and I have let you see it with your eyes,
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:57.420]   but you shall not go over there.'
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.420]   So Moses, a servant of the Lord, died there in the land of Moab,
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:03.420]   according to the word of the Lord.
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:06.420]   And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab,
[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.420]   opposite Beth-peor,
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:12.420]   but no man knows his burial place to this day.
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:16.420]   And although Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died,
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:20.420]   his eye was not dim, nor his vigor abated.
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:26.420]   So the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days.
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:29.420]   Then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end.
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.420]   And now Joshua, the son of Nun, was filled with the spirit of wisdom,
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.420]   for Moses had laid his hands on him,
[00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:38.420]   and the sons of Israel listened to him,
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.420]   and did as the Lord had commanded Moses.
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:45.420]   And since that time no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses,
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:48.420]   whom the Lord knew face to face.
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:51.420]   For all the signs and wonders which the Lord sent him
[00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.420]   to perform in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh,
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:56.420]   all his servants in all his land.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:58.420]   And for all the mighty power and for all the great terror
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:03.420]   which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.420]   You guys know that Moses is one of the most prominent figures
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.420]   in all the scriptures.
[00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:12.420]   He is mentioned in thirty-one of the sixty-six books of the Bible,
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.420]   so nearly half.
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:18.420]   And I'm sure most of us can recount at least a couple of stories
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.420]   or events involving Moses.
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:26.420]   And there are probably images of Moses that pop into our heads right now.
[00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:31.420]   I mean, especially since our children's Bibles are full of them,
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:34.420]   and that in our lifetime there are at least two very famous movies
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.420]   that have been based on his life.
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:41.420]   The first five books of the Bible are called the books of Moses,
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.420]   as he is the primary author.
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:49.420]   And we refer to these books as the Torah or the Law or the Pentateuch,
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:54.420]   and Deuteronomy is the fifth and the final book of the five.
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:59.420]   And Deuteronomy ends with an account of Moses' last moments,
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:04.420]   his death, and then it concludes with a eulogy of sorts.
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:09.420]   So we have a very historic setting here in Deuteronomy chapter 34.
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:12.420]   The children of Israel are on the plains of Moab,
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.420]   and they're just about to enter into the promised land.
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:20.420]   They have just concluded a forty-year nomadic journey in the wilderness,
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.420]   and now they are about to cross the Jordan River into Canaan,
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.420]   the land of promise.
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:29.420]   And they are guaranteed success.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:33.420]   And the twelve tribes of Israel are finally about to enter into the land
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:38.420]   flowing with milk and honey, and there is a buzz and there is an excitement.
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.420]   It's a young group.
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:44.420]   Among the million-plus people that are left there on the plains of Moab,
[00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:49.420]   only three of them are over forty years old.
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:54.420]   Everyone else that had left in the exodus from Egypt had fallen down dead
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.420]   sometime in the wilderness wanderings.
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:01.420]   So there on the plains of Moab, only three people standing
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:07.420]   will be able to recall a life in Egypt, Moses, Joshua, and Caleb.
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:12.420]   And that number is going to go soon from three to two.
[00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:16.420]   So the buzz and the excitement take a hit when Moses,
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:20.420]   their fearless leader who had led them out of Egypt,
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:23.420]   led them in and through the wilderness,
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:28.420]   tells them that he is not continuing on with them into the promised land.
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.420]   And we read in the beginning of chapter 34,
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.420]   we read in the beginning of chapter 34 that God allows Moses to see
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.420]   the land of promise with his own eyes.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:41.420]   And then Moses dies, and the leadership of Tan is passed to Joshua.
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.420]   And the people mourn for him for thirty days,
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:48.420]   and then the book of Deuteronomy closes with a very powerful statement
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:49.420]   on the life of Moses.
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.420]   So Deuteronomy 34 10,
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:57.420]   "Since that time, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses,
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:02.420]   whom the Lord knew face to face."
[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:05.420]   And what a statement.
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:09.420]   It says in verse 6 that God himself buried Moses,
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.420]   so no man knows where Moses is buried,
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.420]   so there's no grave site, there's no tombstone.
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.420]   But what a statement.
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:20.420]   Whom the Lord knew face to face,
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:24.420]   wouldn't have been an amazing line on a tombstone.
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:28.420]   In Exodus 33 11, we see a similar description of Moses.
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:33.420]   "Thus the Lord used to speak to Moses face to face,
[00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:38.420]   just as a man speaks to his friend."
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:43.420]   The scriptures say that God knew Moses face to face,
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:49.420]   that God would speak to Moses face to face like a friend.
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:52.420]   And so this got me to thinking,
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:56.420]   when did this kind of relationship begin?
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:00.420]   Was it when Moses was growing up in Egypt?
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:04.420]   Did it start at the burning bush?
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:08.420]   Did this face to face kind of relationship begin on Mount Sinai
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:13.420]   when Moses would receive the Ten Commandments from God?
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:18.420]   When did the Lord start speaking to Moses face to face?
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:25.420]   And when did Moses' intimate friendship with God begin?
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:31.420]   And is this kind of relationship unique to only Moses?
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:35.420]   Does the Lord speak like this to his people now?
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:41.420]   Do I have this kind of access to God like Moses did?
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:48.420]   And what would it be like for me to be known by the Lord like that?
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.420]   I want to know the Lord like that.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:59.420]   And I want to be a person with whom the Lord talks face to face like a friend.
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:05.420]   And I want to be someone in whom God, the creator of the universe, confides.
[00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:09.420]   Scripture teaches me as a New Testament Christian
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:14.420]   that I'm actually supposed to know the Lord like that.
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:17.420]   And I've been given that kind of access.
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:23.420]   And in eternity, I will have a face to face knowledge of God.
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.420]   So John 17, 3, 1 Corinthians 13, 12,
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:31.420]   inform me that eternal life is knowing God,
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.420]   seeing Him face to face.
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:39.420]   And for me, I know that eternal life does not begin after I physically expire.
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:42.420]   So for those of us who have placed our faith in Christ,
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:46.420]   eternal life has already started.
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:50.420]   And I know that eternal life has already begun for me.
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:56.420]   On this side of eternity, can I know the Lord like this now?
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:03.420]   And in this earthly life, can I have that kind of relationship with God?
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:09.420]   So that when I die, could it say on my tombstone,
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:14.420]   Peter Chung, whom the Lord knew face to face.
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:19.420]   Or Peter Chung, friend of God.
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:24.420]   I mean, it feels very bold, doesn't it?
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.420]   I want to be useful to God.
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.420]   I want to serve Him faithfully.
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.420]   Now, how do I do that?
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:38.420]   And there's a wonderful and almost shocking and offensive mystery in the Scriptures.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:44.420]   In Matthew 11, Jesus himself says that among those born of women,
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:48.420]   none has arisen greater than John the Baptist,
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:52.420]   but that he who is leased in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:57.420]   So John the Baptist is greater than Moses.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:01.420]   But Jesus says that you and I, if we have been made new,
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:06.420]   purchased by the blood of Christ, and if we have the Holy Spirit indwelling within us,
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:16.420]   we have a relationship with God that these giants of our faith never experienced in this life.
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:22.420]   So today I want to walk us through the biblical account of the life of Moses
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:28.420]   and explore what a life cycle of a friend of God looks like.
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.420]   And there's a lot of material in the Bible about Moses,
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:36.420]   including details about what he did, about how he lived.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:41.420]   And most of all of this material is descriptive rather than prescriptive,
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:46.420]   but there's still much we can glean, gather, and observe.
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:56.420]   And Moses lived 120 years, and his life is divided nicely into three periods of exactly 40 years.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:01.420]   Life as a prince in Egypt, life as a shepherd in Midian,
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:06.420]   and life as a leader of Yahweh's people in the wilderness.
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:13.420]   And I call these periods a period of learning, of losing, and of leading.
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:20.420]   And there are things that we can observe in Moses' periods of learning, of losing, and of leading,
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:25.420]   and there are things in these periods that are very common to many other heroes of the faith
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:28.420]   that we read about in the scriptures.
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:33.420]   We do not have too much detail of the first 40 years of Moses' life,
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:38.420]   but the details that we do have are very interesting.
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:44.420]   We know that he was born into the tribe of Levi through both his father and his mother.
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:48.420]   His parents were devout and unafraid of Pharaoh.
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:53.420]   And Moses had an older sister and a brother.
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:57.420]   And when he was three months old, his mother hid him in a wicker basket,
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:02.420]   and he floated down the Nile, and he was picked up by the daughter of Pharaoh.
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:11.420]   And in a strange twist of events, Pharaoh's daughter chose to adopt Moses as a son.
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:17.420]   And this Hebrew child grew up in the house of Pharaoh as a prince.
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:22.420]   And that you guys know, at least from "The Prince of Egypt," right, the movie?
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:27.420]   In Exodus 2, we see Moses' own account, his autobiographical account of his childhood.
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.420]   It's very short, and it moves very fast.
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:35.420]   Here we go. "The child grew, and she," presumably Miriam,
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:39.420]   "brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son.
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:45.420]   And she named him Moses and said, 'Because I drew him out of the water.'"
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:50.420]   Now, it came about in those days when Moses had grown up that he went out to his brethren,
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:57.420]   looked on their hard labors, and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:02.420]   And so he looked this way and that, and when he saw that there was no one around,
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:07.420]   he struck down the Egyptian and hit him in the sand.
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:13.420]   So notice that between verses 10 and 11, 40 years pass,
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:19.420]   and Moses goes from nursing child to 40-year-old man.
[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:26.420]   Notice also that Moses is given his name by Pharaoh's daughter and not by his parents.
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:32.420]   And these are the only details that Moses provides of his own childhood.
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:38.420]   But there are a few things we can assume about Moses' upbringing from this account.
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:42.420]   He was afforded physical and educational opportunities.
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:46.420]   Growing up in Pharaoh's household meant that he was going to have access
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:51.420]   to whatever he needed to become a man of power in Egypt.
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:56.420]   He probably ate the best foods, received the best education.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.420]   And because we know that the Egyptians were a fearsome people,
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:06.420]   we can assume that Moses likely could fight with the best of them.
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.420]   The Egyptians were well known for their military prowess,
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:14.420]   and Egyptian princes did not grow up as spoiled pansies.
[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:17.420]   They were trained to fight.
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:22.420]   So no wonder that Moses easily strikes down an Egyptian taskmaster.
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.420]   No wonder that he's tough enough and scary enough
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:33.420]   to scare off a bunch of roughneck shepherds in order to protect the daughters of Midian.
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:39.420]   And we get some more insight into the life of Moses through Stephen's sermon in Acts 7.
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:43.420]   Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians,
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:48.420]   and he was a man of power in words and deeds.
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:51.420]   But when he was approaching the age of 40, it entered his mind
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:54.420]   to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel.
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:44:00.420]   And when he saw one of them being treated unjustly, he defended him,
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:06.420]   took vengeance for the oppressed by striking down the Egyptian.
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:12.420]   And you suppose that his brethren understood that God was granting them deliverance through him,
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:15.420]   but they did not understand.
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:21.420]   So Moses was given physical, educational, and circumstantial privileges.
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:28.420]   So clearly, God was uniquely equipping Moses to be a national leader.
[00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:32.420]   And he is described as being a man of power,
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:36.420]   and he is powerful in speech and in action.
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:44.420]   And in verse 22, it leads me to believe that Moses was a very eloquent man.
[00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:48.420]   And keep that in mind for when we get to his interaction at the burning bush.
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:53.420]   Moses is articulate and eloquent.
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:56.420]   So Moses not only had the pedigree for leadership,
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:59.420]   it also appears that he had the temperament.
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:03.420]   We see that Moses was a passionate man.
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.420]   He's ready and able to fight.
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.420]   He may have even had anger issues.
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:12.420]   After all, the tribe of Levi in Genesis 49, 5-7,
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:18.420]   Jacob uses the word "anger" and "violence" to describe the tribe of Levi,
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.420]   and that's where both his mom and his dad are from.
[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:28.420]   So Moses in his first 50 years is a zealous man.
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.420]   He's a man of action.
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:34.420]   He has a passion for righteousness.
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:40.420]   And this Acts passage we just read gives us an insight into the mind of Moses,
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:44.420]   who believed himself to be fighting on behalf of God,
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:47.420]   and on behalf of God's causes,
[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:51.420]   and on behalf of God's people.
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:57.420]   He may have had what we now often refer to as like a "savior complex,"
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:03.420]   and it is not difficult to assume that Moses himself believed to be called
[00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:07.420]   a specific Godward purpose.
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:13.420]   After all, it's not every day where a Hebrew slave rises to power in the way that Moses did.
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:16.420]   The last time that it happened was 400 years earlier,
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:21.420]   when a young Hebrew named Joseph became second in command in all of Egypt.
[00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:26.420]   So my belief is that Moses, from early on,
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:33.420]   knew the God of Israel had called him to deliver his people.
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:38.420]   Moses was also a very spiritual, upright, and principled man.
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:40.420]   And let's take a quick look at Hebrews 11.
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:49.420]   "By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:53.420]   choosing rather to endure ill treatment with the people of God
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:58.420]   than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin,
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:02.420]   considering the reproach of Christ's greater riches and the treasures of Egypt,
[00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:05.420]   for he was looking to the reward."
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:09.420]   So what happened to Moses at age 40?
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.420]   The account is there in Exodus 2.
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:17.420]   Moses murders an Egyptian, and then he second guesses that,
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:22.420]   and then his countrymen respond negatively.
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.420]   Pharaoh sets out to kill him.
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:28.420]   Moses becomes afraid and runs for his life.
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:33.420]   And this pretty much sums up what we know of the first third of Moses' life,
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:36.420]   the period of learning in Egypt.
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:43.420]   If I was Moses, I would have been very confused.
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:51.420]   Moses was called by God to be used by God to bless his people.
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:56.420]   But apparently, not quite yet.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:01.420]   So the 40-year period of learning where Moses is equipped, trained, and raised up
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:08.420]   definitely is not wasted, but it turns out that this is not the period of his life
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:11.420]   where God would find him the most useful.
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:14.420]   The zeal is appropriate.
[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:21.420]   Moses' righteous passion for the plight of the people is noble and it's God-given.
[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:26.420]   But it seems that the application of this passion was premature.
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:33.420]   So Moses may have been impetuous, impatient, and perhaps even spiritually reckless,
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:38.420]   because after all, he is called by God to do great things.
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:45.420]   By human standards, Moses at 40 was in his prime.
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:48.420]   Moses was at his peak.
[00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:52.420]   He was well-equipped, well-trained.
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:56.420]   Moses was principled and spiritual.
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:49:01.420]   Moses was passionate for God and for God's people.
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:08.420]   But why is the prime of Moses' life the least spiritually fruitful one?
[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:14.420]   Numbers 12.3, Moses writes this about himself, okay?
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:22.420]   "Now the man Moses was very humble, more than any man who's on the face of the earth."
[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:25.420]   He writes this about himself.
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:30.420]   It takes a supernaturally humble man to say about himself
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:35.420]   that he's the humblest man in the face of the earth.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:38.420]   But I believe it.
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.420]   And I'll explain later why I believe it.
[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:47.420]   But Moses was not a humble man when he was growing up in Egypt.
[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:50.420]   Passionate and perhaps self-righteous, yes.
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:53.420]   Humble, no.
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:50:00.420]   The humility would come as the end result of the next 40-year period of his life
[00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:02.420]   in the desert of Midian.
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:07.420]   The 40-year period of losing
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:11.420]   that comes after the 40-year period of learning.
[00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:15.420]   So after leaving his home in Egypt, Moses comes to Midian.
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:17.420]   He fends off a group of shepherds.
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:21.420]   He protects the seven daughters of Jethro.
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:24.420]   And they go and tell their father about him.
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:29.420]   And Jethro, who's called Reuel in chapter 2, invites him to stick around.
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:31.420]   Okay, and I'm going to read this account for you.
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:38.420]   "Moses was willing to dwell with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses.
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:42.420]   And then she gave birth to a son, and he named him Gershom,
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:45.420]   for he said, 'I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.'
[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:50.420]   And now it came about in the course of those many days that the king of Egypt died,
[00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:54.420]   and the sons of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried out.
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:57.420]   And their cry for help because of their bondage rose up to God."
[00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:00.420]   And notice how God is active in this.
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:05.420]   "So God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:11.420]   God saw the sons of Israel, and God took notice of them.
[00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:16.420]   Now Moses was pasturing the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian.
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:22.420]   And he led the flock to the west side of the wilderness, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God."
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:27.420]   So for the next 40 years, the second section of 40 years,
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:30.420]   Moses is a shepherd in the wilderness.
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:36.420]   He's pasturing the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian.
[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:41.420]   If Moses had been called by God to a noble purpose, as Hebrews 11 alludes to,
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:50.420]   imagine how confusing it would have been for him to first be misunderstood and rejected by the very people he's trying to help,
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:52:00.420]   and then to have his education and his oratory skills all go to waste from neglect for 40 years.
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:09.420]   No matter what you've studied, if you don't use it for 40 years, you will likely forget everything.
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:14.420]   Up until 2012, I was pretty conversant in Mandarin.
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:18.420]   I'm ethnically Korean, but I could speak Chinese.
[00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:28.420]   It's been 10 years since I've left China, and now I'm like, "Uhhh," and Spanish comes up.
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:33.420]   My last Spanish class was back in 1994.
[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:38.420]   My Spanish now? No bueno. That's all I know.
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:44.420]   My last math class was a calculus course in 1996.
[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:50.420]   26 years since I took calculus, all but forgotten.
[00:52:50.420 --> 00:53:01.420]   Moses spent 40 years taking care of sheep.
[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:08.420]   You may not pick up on this at first glance, but for a person who has been trained up in all the wisdom of Egypt,
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:16.420]   and all the learning of Egypt, being a shepherd is the last thing you want to do as an occupation.
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:24.420]   So if you remember the accounts of Joseph in Genesis 46, this is a scene where Joseph is prepping his family to meet Pharaoh.
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:27.420]   And he says, "This is what you should say when you meet Pharaoh."
[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:32.420]   And we get a glimpse into the worldview of the Egyptians through this passage.
[00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:39.420]   Genesis 46, 34, "You shall say your servants have been keepers of livestock from your youth even until now,
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:44.420]   both we and our fathers, that you may live in the land of Goshen.
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:50.420]   For every shepherd is loathsome to the Egyptians."
[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:52.420]   Every shepherd was loathsome to the Egyptians.
[00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:56.420]   The ESV, LSB say, "An abomination."
[00:53:56.420 --> 00:54:02.420]   That's a strong word. The NIV uses the word "detestable," "disgusting."
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:10.420]   So in Genesis 43, we see that the Egyptians and Hebrews, they couldn't even eat together for this reason.
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:21.420]   So this is a very far cry from who Moses used to be, and what he used to be, and where he used to be.
[00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:27.420]   And at the tail end of this 40-year period, God hears the prayers of the people.
[00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:34.420]   He mobilizes Aaron in advance, sets a bush on fire, draws Moses to himself,
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:44.420]   and Moses, the now lowly shepherd, speaks to God on Horeb in the midst of a fiery bush.
[00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:47.420]   And this is what happens, Exodus 3, 7.
[00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:51.420]   "The Lord said, 'I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt,
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:56.420]   and have given heed to their cry because of their taskmasters, for I am aware of their sufferings.
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:59.420]   So I have come now to deliver them from the power of the Egyptians,
[00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:05.420]   and to bring them up from that land to a good and spacious land, to a land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:12.420]   Therefore come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh, so that you may bring my people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.'
[00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:19.420]   But Moses said to God, 'Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh,
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:25.420]   and that I should bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt?'"
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:31.420]   Notice what Moses says to God in verse 11, "Who am I?"
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:45.420]   Moses, the once impetuous, passionate, zealous man, is now begging for confirmation, affirmation.
[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.420]   He's fishing for it.
[00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:54.420]   So God promises to be with him, and he promises to perform miracles through him,
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.420]   and then Moses remains unconvinced.
[00:55:56.420 --> 00:56:04.420]   So God shows him two miracles in his sight on that spot, but still Moses says, "No, thank you very much."
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:09.420]   And we see his arrogant response, Exodus 4 10.
[00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:16.420]   "Then Moses said to the Lord, 'Please, Lord, I have never been eloquent,
[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:22.420]   neither recently nor in time past nor since you have spoken to your servant,
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:27.420]   for I am slow of speech, slow of tongue.'
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:32.420]   And the Lord said to him, 'Who has made man's mouth, or makes him mute or deaf or seeing or blind?
[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:35.420]   Is it not I, the Lord?
[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:45.420]   Now then, go, and even I will be with your mouth and teach you what you are to say.'
[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:54.420]   But Moses said, 'Please, Lord, send the message by someone else, by whomever you will.'
[00:56:54.420 --> 00:57:01.420]   And then the anger of the Lord burned against Moses."
[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:09.420]   So for 40 years, Moses had been living a very ordinary life in Midian, and in his mind,
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:13.420]   he is not the man he once used to be.
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:18.420]   My guess is that he was thinking something like, "Well, if only you had used me 40 years ago.
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:24.420]   I was already stationed there. I was eloquent. I was charismatic.
[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:30.420]   I was young and passionate. I had leadership. I could throw some hands.
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:39.420]   But now, I'm just a lowly, smelly, abominable shepherd."
[00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:44.420]   Moses is not a humble man at this burning bush.
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:48.420]   He is an arrogant man.
[00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:54.420]   He is struggling with what we would call an inferiority complex,
[00:57:54.420 --> 00:58:01.420]   comparing his 80-year-old self with who he once used to be.
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:09.420]   Inferiority complex, insecurity, self-deprecation, those are not the same things as humility.
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:14.420]   In fact, all of that is just wounded pride.
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:18.420]   Some of you in here struggle with self-confidence.
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:23.420]   That's not humility. That's just damaged ego.
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:29.420]   God's anger never burns toward a humble man.
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:32.420]   It burns toward the arrogant.
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:37.420]   It burns toward those who minimize the power of God,
[00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:44.420]   and those who believe that their inability is greater than God's ability.
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:49.420]   And there at that bush, Moses is arrogantly saying,
[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:55.420]   "God, even you can't help me do this thing.
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:59:00.420]   My mouth is now completely useless. I am useless.
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:03.420]   Use someone else. Send someone else.
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:10.420]   I have too much failure in my life. I'm too old. Don't use me."
[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:16.420]   So the 40 years tending sheep in Midian has not only humbled,
[00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:21.420]   but has humiliated this once confident and passionate man, Moses.
[00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:26.420]   And he needed these 40 years to be emptied of himself,
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:33.420]   to lose confidence in himself, in his talents, in his experiences, and in his strength.
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:39.420]   And the story continues, and Moses goes back to the Hebrew people,
[00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:41.420]   and initially it looks like there's some hope,
[00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:45.420]   but as soon as Pharaoh makes things a little bit harder,
[00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:47.420]   the Hebrews reject Moses again.
[00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:55.420]   Trauma, PTSD, right?
[00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:57.420]   And they blame Moses.
[00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:59.420]   So that doesn't go well.
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:06.420]   And you immediately see a whining Moses, whining to God in Exodus 5.
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:09.420]   "They said to them, 'May the Lord look upon you and judge you,
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:13.420]   for you have made us odious in Pharaoh's sight and in the sight of his servants,
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:16.420]   to put a sword in their hand to kill us.'
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:18.420]   Then Moses returned to the Lord and said,
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:22.420]   'Oh Lord, why have you brought harm to this people?
[01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:25.420]   Why did you ever send me?
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:28.420]   Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name,
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:34.420]   he has done harm to this people, and you have not delivered your people at all.'"
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:38.420]   That's how he sounds when I read.
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:42.420]   So God just continues to humble Moses.
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:46.420]   And even at the doorstep of Pharaoh's court,
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:51.420]   Moses, we see him being stripped of all that he thought himself to be.
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:56.420]   A.W. Tozer, the great American pastor-theologian, once said,
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:08.420]   "It is doubtful whether God can use a man greatly until he has hurt him deeply."
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:15.420]   Moses' ancestor Joseph was more useful to God as a prisoner
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:18.420]   than as a young man in the prime of his life.
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:23.420]   And Joseph is in prison innocently for 13 years.
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:27.420]   We see in the New Testament the apostle Peter
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:32.420]   was more useful to God broken and ashamed
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:37.420]   than while he was wielding either a sword or a fishing net.
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:41.420]   We see the apostle Paul was more useful to God
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:46.420]   as a thorn-bearing former murderer and persecutor
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:51.420]   than as he was a leader in the Sanhedrin.
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:58.420]   It is doubtful whether God can use a man greatly until he has hurt him deeply.
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:03.420]   Moses was being prepared to be used by God in very powerful ways.
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:09.420]   He just needed to lose, completely lose all confidence in his own flesh.
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:12.420]   It's interesting because in the wilderness, you know what?
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:16.420]   God is teaching Moses.
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:19.420]   In using Moses to shepherd sheep in the wilderness,
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:24.420]   God was training him to shepherd people in the wilderness for another 40 years.
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:26.420]   Nothing was wasted.
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:31.420]   So the first 40 years of Moses' life in Egypt was a period of learning.
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:37.420]   The second 40 years of Moses' life was a period of losing his confidence in himself
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:44.420]   and of utter humbling to make him useful.
[01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:50.420]   So for many of us sitting here today who have a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:57.420]   we're probably somewhere in between these two phases of friendship with God.
[01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:02.420]   Some of us in here, you're excited about your faith and you're feeling antsy
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:06.420]   because we want to be put to use.
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:10.420]   We want to do some great and extraordinary things for God.
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:19.420]   Some of us in our youthful pride and arrogance feel somehow that God needs us for his ministry.
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:25.420]   And this learning period is a period in which young men and women of God can get restless
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:30.420]   and want things to move to action in the name of righteousness.
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:36.420]   And this is a period in which great and exciting things are expected.
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:40.420]   But on the contrary, this is a period where oftentimes there is no movement,
[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:48.420]   there is no fruit, and there are tons of mistakes made in the name of righteousness.
[01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:53.420]   We've learned some things, and we're frustrated because the people around us
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:57.420]   aren't excited about the same things.
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:04.420]   The learning stage is not a bad stage, but this is a stage where caution, watchfulness,
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:08.420]   wisdom, and humility are greatly needed.
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:14.420]   If you're excited about your faith and about making your mark for the kingdom of God,
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:18.420]   you need to be careful.
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:24.420]   Some of us may be in the second stage, but we're being humbled.
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:29.420]   We failed, and we've been failing.
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:33.420]   And there are lots of things we are losing.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:40.420]   Circumstances are revealing to us that we aren't as godly as we may have thought ourselves to be.
[01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:45.420]   Perhaps we're being broken down and beaten up, wondering how God could ever use
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:55.420]   such sin-tainted, messed up, incompetent people like us, especially after all that we've done.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:05:00.420]   I kind of feel like I'm in that season now.
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:06.420]   Today marks the 21st anniversary of 9/11.
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:10.420]   I remember vividly the events of that day and that week,
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:16.420]   because that was right smack in the middle of my very first year as a pastor.
[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:23.420]   21 years have passed, and objectively, I am a very different kind of pastor.
[01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:26.420]   I know my worldview has gotten bigger.
[01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:31.420]   My understanding of Scripture has for sure increased.
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:37.420]   But I have a whole lot less confidence in me.
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:41.420]   I have more fear now, speaking on behalf of the Lord.
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:46.420]   The phrase, "Thus saith the Lord," sends me chills.
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:52.420]   Because I don't want to speak or teach or say anything in vain.
[01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:57.420]   I used to think I was very good with people.
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.420]   Now people scare me.
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:03.420]   You terrify me.
[01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:15.420]   And I constantly feel like I'm poorly stewarding the people and the relationships that are in my life.
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:20.420]   Back in 2001, I remember thinking--I mean, I never voiced this, but I remember thinking,
[01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:24.420]   "I am God's gift to Christendom."
[01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:26.420]   And obviously, I packaged that in a humble way.
[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:28.420]   I never said it.
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:31.420]   And my prayer was, "God, use me."
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:33.420]   And I would list the great heroes of faith.
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:40.420]   "Use me like David. Use me like Joshua. Use me. I will be in your service."
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:46.420]   Now in 2022, I more often pray that God gives me the grace so that I don't get in the way.
[01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:49.420]   That I don't get disqualified.
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:52.420]   I don't mess things up.
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:07:00.420]   Now I'm painfully aware of how much God does not need me.
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:08.420]   My life is just a mist passing through.
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:13.420]   But interestingly enough, at the same time,
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:22.420]   I want so much more to know God intimately as a friend.
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:29.420]   I don't need extra blessings either in this life or in heaven.
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:32.420]   I just want God.
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:36.420]   I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:40.420]   and the fellowship of sharing his sufferings and becoming like him in his death.
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:44.420]   I want to know what that is like.
[01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:53.420]   And I want to know him without my sins just getting in the way of that knowledge.
[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:59.420]   For believers in Jesus Christ, there are ups and downs and varying seasons in our walks.
[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:03.420]   And at times we actually can go back and forth from season one and season two.
[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:08.420]   From learning to losing to learning to losing all over again.
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:14.420]   We can go from being equipped and then being excited and taking ourselves too seriously.
[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:19.420]   And then we plummet into seasons where we are being broken and humbled and embarrassed.
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:24.420]   And we wallow and we forget that his power is made perfect in our weakness.
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:29.420]   We go back and forth.
[01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:37.420]   I want to live a life where I'm truly thriving and leading people to Christ.
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:42.420]   And I want to one day be at a point in my friendship with God
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:49.420]   where my ministry is completely devoid of me.
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:54.420]   Where everything is about Christ and Christ alone.
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:09:00.420]   In Exodus 34, the glory of God is shining off of Moses' face.
[01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:04.420]   Initially, he doesn't even realize it. He's unaware.
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:09.420]   He starts putting a veil over his face because people around him are freaking out.
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:13.420]   That the glory of God is reflecting off this mortal man.
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:19.420]   And he's oblivious.
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:26.420]   Here's a word of caution as you ponder what season of the Christian walk you are in.
[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:30.420]   And how you are doing as a friend of God.
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:45.420]   At every stage in Hebrews 11, we see that Moses refused to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:51.420]   If the majority of your day-to-day thoughts are on enjoying this world,
[01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:59.420]   and seeing how much you can toe the line of being worldly and still squeaking somehow into heaven,
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:04.420]   you are likely not on either stage one or stage two.
[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:09.420]   You are on the outside of the friendship of God.
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:17.420]   Because scripture teaches us that friendship with God and friendship with the world are mutually exclusive.
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:24.420]   So James 4:4 says that friendship with the world is hostility toward God.
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:29.420]   And we serve a very good, but a very jealous God.
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:34.420]   Matthew 6, 24, "No one, you are not an exception.
[01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:41.420]   No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other,
[01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:45.420]   or he will be devoted to one and despise the other.
[01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:51.420]   You cannot be a friend of God and be a friend of sin.
[01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:56.420]   It's impossible.
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:11:05.420]   And the things that I've discussed thus far will not pertain to you if you are a God-hater.
[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:11.420]   You were created by God and for God to love God and to serve God,
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:19.420]   but you've completely misunderstood your purpose if you think that God exists for your happiness.
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:24.420]   As it says in Isaiah 55, for you guys who are in that situation,
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:30.420]   "Seek the Lord while he may be found and call upon him while he is near,
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:35.420]   because he is slow to anger, gracious and compassionate."
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:41.420]   So I don't know exactly when Moses starts speaking to God face to face,
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:46.420]   but when we get to Deuteronomy, Moses is a changed man.
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:49.420]   He is a godly man.
[01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:54.420]   He is a Christ-like man.
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:12:01.420]   And we see him walking with God and speaking on behalf of God like a friend.
[01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:05.420]   So we are going to look at the final 40 years of Moses' life,
[01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:10.420]   the season of his spiritual leadership.
[01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:17.420]   And at the onset, this final 40 years looks great.
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:25.420]   But it's the most painful, most frustrating, most challenging,
[01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:32.420]   but still most God-glorifying third of Moses' life.
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:36.420]   Do you really want ministry success and be a friend of God?
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:42.420]   Yeesh! For the final 40 years of Moses' life,
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:45.420]   Moses leads God's people in and through the wilderness,
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:48.420]   right up to the edge of the Promised Land.
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:51.420]   And that begins with Moses' second departure out of Egypt.
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:54.420]   So let's look at the beginning of this.
[01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:57.420]   "Thus the Lord saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians,
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:01.420]   and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore."
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:04.420]   So, so far so good, right? Fruit.
[01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:08.420]   "When Israel saw the great power which the Lord had used against the Egyptians,
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:12.420]   the people feared the Lord." Great.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:15.420]   "And they believed in the Lord." Awesome.
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:20.420]   "And in His servant Moses." Yay for Moses.
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:24.420]   "And then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to the Lord and said,
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:29.420]   'I will sing to the Lord, for He has highly exalted the horse and its riders.
[01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:33.420]   He has hurled into the sea.'"
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:38.420]   If only Moses' last 40 years of his life were all like this.
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:42.420]   The people not only believe in the Lord, they believe in Moses.
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:48.420]   And the whole community erupts in praise with Moses leading the charge.
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:51.420]   But if you guys are familiar with the Old Testament,
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:55.420]   you know that this is very, very short-lived.
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:14:00.420]   In the same chapter, toward the end of chapter 15,
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:03.420]   the people grumble about water.
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:07.420]   Chapter 16, they grumble about food.
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:11.420]   And then about meat. And then water again.
[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:16.420]   And then they complain that Moses doesn't make himself available enough to handle all the disputes.
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:22.420]   So Moses has to, he listens to Jethro and sets up little advisors.
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:27.420]   And then when Moses is meeting in Sinai with God,
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:33.420]   one of history's most amazing moments where God comes down and meets face to face with a man,
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:35.420]   he comes down from Mount Sinai.
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:37.420]   And what are the Israelites doing?
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:45.420]   They're dancing around a golden calf that his brother made.
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:52.420]   And then they have to take the sword and plunge it through 3,000 men.
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:57.420]   And then Nadab and Ebihu, at a moment that was supposed to be super sacred,
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:59.420]   they get caught up in the hype.
[01:14:59.420 --> 01:15:01.420]   They offer unauthorized fire.
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:05.420]   They get struck down and they're Moses' nephews.
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:09.420]   And he has to watch this.
[01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:15.420]   And they grumble about water and meat again.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:18.420]   And then they complain about hardship again.
[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:24.420]   And then they start blaming Moses for all this hardship.
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:31.420]   The people make an outcry saying that they should elect a new leader and then go back to Egypt.
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:34.420]   A rebellion is stirred up by Korah.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:38.420]   And then the ground opens up and swallows them up.
[01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:41.420]   14,700 people get hit with the plague. They die.
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:43.420]   They still grumble.
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:49.420]   The vipers come, bite them. They still grumble.
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:55.420]   Even Aaron and Miriam betray Moses.
[01:15:55.420 --> 01:16:02.420]   So there is so much heartache and death for this friend of God.
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:04.420]   By the time we get to Deuteronomy 34,
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:12.420]   everyone that Moses led out of Egypt has died in the wilderness.
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:15.420]   Except Joshua and Caleb.
[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:22.420]   And I do not think Moses as a heartless, cold man who celebrated their deaths.
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:28.420]   My guess is that he lamented each and every single death.
[01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:33.420]   Who would want this kind of ministry?
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:39.420]   Why would God allow this for his friend?
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:44.420]   Do you want to be a friend of God?
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:52.420]   Moses' ministry fruit came from representing Holy God to hundreds of thousands of stiff-necked, stubborn people for four decades.
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:17:03.420]   Intimate friendship with God often leads to great loneliness and rejection while ministering in this life.
[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:05.420]   And I'll say that again.
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:20.420]   Intimate friendship with God often leads to great loneliness and rejection while ministering in this life.
[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:25.420]   True ministry success, true God-glorifying service,
[01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:28.420]   more often than not, it brings pain.
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:30.420]   It brings suffering.
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:32.420]   It brings isolation.
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:36.420]   It brings despair.
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:40.420]   This is not for the faint of heart.
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:51.420]   But ironically and interestingly, it always produces compassion, mercy, and love.
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:56.420]   And we see these things in Moses' humble third season alive.
[01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:58.420]   Moses comes down from Mount Sinai.
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:01.420]   We see that he sees the people dancing around the golden calf.
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:03.420]   And then he returns to the Lord to intercede.
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:04.420]   Exodus 32.
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:11.420]   On the next day, Moses said to the people, "You yourselves have committed a great sin, and now I'm going up to the Lord.
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:15.420]   Perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.
[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:18.420]   He's ready to sacrifice himself."
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:26.420]   And then Moses returned to the Lord and said, "Alas, this people has committed a great sin, and they have made a god of gold for themselves.
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:38.420]   But now, Yahweh, if you will forgive their sin, and if you will not, please blot me out from your book which you have written."
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:41.420]   Do you see Moses' heart here?
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:47.420]   The people around him have sinned grievously when they worshiped the golden calf as God.
[01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:51.420]   And Moses pleads with the Lord for them.
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:55.420]   And Moses asked the Lord to forgive the sins of the people.
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:19:06.420]   And if that means that Moses himself is blotted out of the book of life and sent to hell to face eternal condemnation, so be it.
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:13.420]   That's how much Moses desires God to be glorified through mercy.
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:20.420]   That's how much godly compassion now resides in this friend of God.
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:24.420]   That's absolutely selfless and astounding.
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:31.420]   Even in the face of insult and personal betrayal, that humility and that compassion is there.
[01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:39.420]   Numbers 12, we see Miriam and Aaron, fellow leaders of the nation, Moses' own sister and brother.
[01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:42.420]   They criticize and speak out against him.
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:50.420]   And they say, "Has the Lord indeed spoken only through Moses? Has he not spoken through us as well?"
[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:53.420]   And then it says, "The Lord heard it."
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:56.420]   And then God said, "Come out."
[01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:59.420]   I mean, imagine if God was on your side like that. That'd be great.
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:02.420]   If someone injures me and God says to them, "Hey, get over here."
[01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:04.420]   And then this is what God says.
[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:08.420]   "Not so much," I mean, I don't speak in visions and dreams of Moses.
[01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:12.420]   "Not so much with my servant Moses. He is faithful in all my house.
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:17.420]   With him I speak mouth to mouth, even openly, not in dark sayings.
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:19.420]   And he beholds the form of the Lord.
[01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:24.420]   Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?
[01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:29.420]   So the anger of the Lord burned against them."
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:32.420]   And he does a very, he walks out.
[01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:35.420]   Scary stuff.
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:43.420]   "And then the cloud had withdrawn over the tent, and behold, Miriam was leprous, wide as snow.
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:49.420]   As Aaron turned toward Miriam, behold, she was leprous."
[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:59.420]   Moses, seeing his sister covered in leprosy because of her sins,
[01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:03.420]   immediately turns and says,
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:11.420]   "Moses cried out to the Lord, saying, 'O God, heal her, I pray.'"
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:24.420]   Friends of God are always forgiving.
[01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:28.420]   It's fascinating.
[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:31.420]   We love because He first loved us.
[01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:39.420]   I can forgive because I've been forgiven so much by my friend.
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:43.420]   The latter years of Moses' life, you see him walking with God,
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:47.420]   and he submits fully to the sovereign purposes of God.
[01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:50.420]   And Moses is told in Deuteronomy 31 and 33
[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:54.420]   that he's not going to lead the people into the promised land.
[01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:56.420]   Joshua is going to do that.
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:59.420]   And so he proceeds to bless each of the tribes of Israel.
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:02.420]   He gives them warnings to keep the covenant of the Lord
[01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:06.420]   and to be faithful once they enter into Canaan.
[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:09.420]   He doesn't worry about leaving a mark.
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:13.420]   He doesn't worry about any kind of legacy.
[01:22:13.420 --> 01:22:18.420]   This is a man whose primary desire was usefulness to God,
[01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:21.420]   to give glory to God.
[01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:25.420]   And Moses is not going to lead his people into the land of promise.
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:27.420]   Joshua is going to be doing that.
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:32.420]   And Moses' job is now simply to pass the baton.
[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:36.420]   You know what's super interesting?
[01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:42.420]   Moses does not die of natural causes.
[01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:49.420]   I think God slays him and then buries him himself.
[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:52.420]   Deuteronomy 34, 5-7.
[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:56.420]   So Moses, a servant of the Lord, died there in the land of Moab
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:58.420]   according to the word of the Lord,
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:02.420]   and he, capital H, buried him in the valley in the land of Moab
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:04.420]   opposite Beth-peor.
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:09.420]   But no one, no man knows his burial place to this day.
[01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:14.420]   And although Moses was 120 years old when he died,
[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:22.420]   his eye was not dim, and he was perfectly healthy.
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:25.420]   His eye was not dim, his vigor was abated.
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:27.420]   This is a very healthy and strong man.
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:31.420]   And like Enoch in Genesis 5-24, Moses walked with God,
[01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:38.420]   and then he was not because God took him.
[01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:43.420]   God put Moses, his friend, to physical death.
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:47.420]   God buried him, then ushered him home.
[01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:51.420]   And I doubt that Moses, when he entered glory, regretted anything.
[01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:54.420]   Regretted not entering the promised land.
[01:23:54.420 --> 01:24:00.420]   Regretted not living to 160.
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:05.420]   This is what a humble friendship with God looks like.
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:11.420]   Walking with God, loving his people,
[01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:15.420]   and faithful service and perseverance in the midst of loneliness,
[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:21.420]   fruitfulness, all the while completely oblivious
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:25.420]   to the fruit that is being born around you.
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:30.420]   That's friendship with God.
[01:24:30.420 --> 01:24:34.420]   And then, when all is said and done,
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:41.420]   you take the baton and you pass it to the next guy.
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:46.420]   He must increase, I decrease.
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:50.420]   That's the growth of the heart of the friend of God.
[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:58.420]   And I want to close with a look at this great baton pass
[01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:00.420]   that continues on with us.
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:05.420]   Hebrews 11-33 down.
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:08.420]   "Who by faith conquered kingdoms,
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:10.420]   performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises,
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:13.420]   shut the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire,
[01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:17.420]   escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong,
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:20.420]   became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight,
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:23.420]   women received back their dead by resurrection,
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:27.420]   and others were tortured, not accepting their release
[01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:29.420]   so that they might attain a better resurrection.
[01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:34.420]   And other friends of God experienced mockings and scourgings,
[01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:36.420]   yes, also chains and imprisonment.
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:40.420]   They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted,
[01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:42.420]   they were put to death with the sword,
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:45.420]   they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins,
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:48.420]   being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated.
[01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:51.420]   Friends of God, men of whom the world was not worthy,
[01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:56.420]   wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground,
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:26:00.420]   and all of these, having gained approval through their faith,
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:06.420]   and faith alone did not receive what was promised on this side of eternity,
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:10.420]   because God had provided something better for us,
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:14.420]   so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.
[01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:23.420]   Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us,
[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:28.420]   let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us,
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:32.420]   and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,
[01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:36.420]   fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith,
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:39.420]   who for the joy set before him endured the cross,
[01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:44.420]   despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:51.420]   For consider him who has endured such hostility by sinners against himself,
[01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:56.420]   so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
[01:26:56.420 --> 01:27:04.420]   I want to know Christ,
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:07.420]   and the power of his resurrection,
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:11.420]   and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings.
[01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:15.420]   That helps me to persevere.
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:20.420]   Will you join with me in prayer?
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:35.420]   Lord, would you help us to walk with you,
[01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:44.420]   to minister in and through the power of your Spirit.
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:52.420]   Lord, would you grant that we live lives that are very useful,
[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:58.420]   that we would be ambassadors for Christ wherever we are,
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:04.420]   and that when you deem fit, you take us away to glory.
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:10.420]   For the time that you've given us to steward while we're here,
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:17.420]   may our cry with John the Baptist simply be that you must increase,
[01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:20.420]   and that we decrease.
[01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:26.420]   For we know that therein lies our greatest joy.
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:33.420]   Remind us of these truths, regardless of whatever season that we find ourselves in.
[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:36.420]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:40.420]   Church, let's go ahead and stand together.
