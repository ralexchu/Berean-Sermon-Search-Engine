[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Please turn your Bibles over to Galatians 5, verse 13-26.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   And I think it's three weeks ago, two weeks ago, I started the first half.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Sorry that we had an intermission.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   And I'm doing the second half of the sermon, where the first half,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   I talked about how the book of Galatians is going to teach us that we're free.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   By being Christians in Christ, we are freed people.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   But that freedom means to be in the kingdom of God.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   That freedom means to be in the spirit of Christ.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   So, here in Galatians, Apostle Paul is going to exhort us,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   exhort the churches to walk in that spirit.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   I'm going to start reading from verse 13-26, and then we'll study verse 16 and down.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   "For you were called to freedom, brethren. Only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   But through love serve one another. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   in the statement, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   For these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are immorality, impurity, sensuality,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these. Of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   that those who practice such things will not enter, inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Against such things there is no law.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Let us not become boastful, challenging one another, envying one another. Amen.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Now, I gave you the context again that Apostle Paul is making a strong admonition here.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   You're free. And as free individuals, you should live in that freedom.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   The wholeness of that freedom. And he makes that into a challenge as, "Then live in the Spirit."
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Walk in the Spirit. Be in tune with the Spirit. And then he says later, "Keep your step with the Spirit."
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And I want to remind us that by context, why he's giving such a strong admonition is because the Galatians were in danger
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   where they first received the truth, and then false teaching came in where somebody said,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   "No, you need circumcision too to be holy. You need washing of hands. You need observance of festivals.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   You need to eat a certain diet."
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And all of a sudden, the legalism that existed prior to the Gospel of Christ now started to come in
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   as a means by which these individuals would gain greater holiness or a greater relationship with God.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And so, if you turn just a page over back to chapter 3, verse 3,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   it just summarizes the whole of the problem that the Galatians were facing.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And Galatians 3, verse 3 basically says, "Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?"
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And he asks that question in that sarcastic, absurd, "You began your spiritual life by the Spirit of God."
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   And what I mean by that is, every single one of us in here who is a genuine Christian,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   you have a spiritual existence that was created not by you, but by the Spirit of God.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And we can go down the list here. What was it that initially caused you to have faith?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   It was the Spirit of God.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And so essentially, Apostle Paul is questioning,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   "What is going to be the thing that causes you to grow in the faith and have faith now, to maintain that faith?"
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   The Spirit.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   What caused us to respond to truth?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Initially, when we heard the truth, rather than saying, "Ah, stop judging me,"
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   but rather to like it, to respond to it appropriately, what caused that in our lives?
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   It was the Spirit.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   What caused us to repent and have contrition of heart?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   It was the Spirit.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   What caused us to submit?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   What caused us to desire to be in Christ, to obey, to listen, to be in fellowship?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   What caused all of that?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   It was the Spirit of God.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Now, I am not saying that there is no part on our end in terms of our energy, our actions, or anything like that.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   What I'm saying is, what caused that initially to happen is the Spirit.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I am placing all credit on the Spirit.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I am placing a confidence on what the Spirit can do in you,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   and I am placing confidence on what the Spirit can do in me.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And what's more, what the Spirit has already done.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   And why do we say this?
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   It's because, do we have a problem?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Do we share in the kind of problem like they did,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   where perhaps, although we are Christian, we keep turning to things that is not of the Spirit?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   We keep turning to things that is actually not the person of the Spirit.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Him who abides in us.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   He who abides in us,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   He who continues to teach us,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   and I can go down the list of the things by which the Spirit benefits us.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Let me help you a little bit.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   The Spirit is the one who continues to help us have an intimate relationship with God.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   The Spirit is the one who actually searches the mind of God and continues to reveal that mind to us.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   The Spirit is the one who then is actually giving light for us to see the truth of the Scripture.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   The Spirit is the one moving in us so that we are strengthened in the inner man.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   The Spirit is the one who teaches us,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   "This is who you should be like, the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   The Spirit shines Christ to us.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   He is the one who convicts us what is of the devil and what is of the Lord.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Who convicts us what is good and what is bad.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   The Spirit is the one who ministers to us, the paraclete who helps us.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   He comforts us like no one else can.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   He is the one who intercedes for us.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   It is a He who is powerful and it is He who has brought to you life.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   And then He is embedded in you, sealing you, guaranteeing you to the end.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   But do we have a problem where sometimes we turn to other things?
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   We have issues in our lives where we are sad, we are hurt, we are dejected, we are disappointed.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And where do we turn?
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Where do we turn?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Typically things that will immediately satisfy, typically things where we think there are answers.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Sometimes we even turn to non-Christian counselors.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   "Help me with my spiritual struggle."
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   And I wonder if He, the Spirit, is saying, "Did you forget about me?"
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Here is an interesting thing.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Go in your Bibles please to Jeremiah 2 and we will read from verse 11 down to verse 13.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Jeremiah 2 from verse 11 to 13.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   I want to highlight this dilemma that we as Christians, after having began our life in Christ,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   oftentimes turn to something different.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Turn perhaps not just to something different, something entirely insufficient.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And then we will see how God speaks of it in Jeremiah as Jeremiah's prophet speaking God's perspective and commentary on what has happened.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   He says this,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   What are the two evils?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   First, they have forsaken me, the fountain of living water.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Brothers and sisters, right now I am highlighting the benefits, the joys, the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   This ministry of the Holy Spirit given to us is what I talked about the last time we were here,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   talking about the freedom that we have.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   The freedom that we have framed in another way is our membership into a new country.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   It is the kingdom of God.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And just like a refugee in current times is running away perhaps from an oppressive country,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   is running away perhaps from things that are just like slavery,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   and wanting to go to a kingdom that has privileges, that has securities, and that has benefits,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   we are in the kingdom of God in the Spirit of Christ receiving all the benefits of the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   And Jesus Christ in the Gospel of John mentioned many times,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   "I want to give you life. He who comes and drinks of me, you're going to have rivers of life."
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   And He says, "Because I'm going to send you the Spirit.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   And the Spirit is going to be such a benefit to you that it's better that I go."
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Remember that?
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   So why is it that we have such a huge confusion?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Why is it that many times we don't go to the Spirit?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   And my admonition for the entire sermon is going to be,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   "Learn what it is to go to the Spirit and continue going to Him.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   For that is the essence of our existence.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   We are spiritual beings.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And we need to continue then in walking with the Spirit."
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   So number one, let's take a look at verse 16.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Let's take a look at verse 16.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And it says here, "But I say, walk by the Spirit,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   and you will not carry out the desires of the flesh."
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Wow!
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   What an awesome, amazing verse.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   He essentially gives you a solution to the problem that every single one of you and I have.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Our battle against our flesh, sinful desires, sinful tendencies and habits.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   He says not, "Hey, take up your knife and go fight."
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   He doesn't say, "Here's the tactic and strategy."
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   He says, "Walk in the Spirit, and you are not going to give yourself to that fleshly desire."
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And the thing about it is, that simple challenge to walk by the Spirit is reiterated in verse 25.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   And in the ESV translation, it says, "Keep in step with the Spirit."
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   That is a more literal rendition of that.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   You can generally just say, "Hey, walk."
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   But what is that? It's just to take one step and another step.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   You need to keep in pace with Him.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   You need to follow those tracks and keep on cue in that marching order, so to speak.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Okay, so what does that mean?
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   What does that mean?
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Now I'm going to be honest.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   I think a lot of people, and for me too, a while back, in early stages of Christianity,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   if you were to tell me, "You need to be in the Spirit and walk in the Spirit."
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   I'd say, "That's right."
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   What does that mean?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   You know, like, "Be in the Spirit."
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I don't know what else to say about that, really.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   And actually, a lot of people think that.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   You've heard the pendulum swing of, like, you've got to work hard to be sanctified,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   and then you've got to be like, "You can't. You've got to let God."
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   So that perspective is kind of like, "Well, I'm waiting for the Spirit to fill me,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   to maybe, like, knock me off my feet, blow my mind, and then stuff, like, happens."
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Some people think that way.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   But I don't think that's what he's talking about,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   and I don't think we need to confuse what walking in the Spirit
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   and walking after not a force but a person,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   we don't need to confuse what that is.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Why?
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   I have heard recently that a good portion of our church members,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   they go to these gyms, you know, 24-hour fitness or LA fitness,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   and then they take classes.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   And more recently, there's been this trend, and a bunch of groups of people,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   and to tell you honestly, it sounds like a lot of fun,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   but they're doing this Brazilian dance class called Zumba.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   And it's pretty funny, and it's not just girls.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   There's, like, a bunch of guys from church doing it, too.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   [laughter]
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   And I'm pretty sure, you know, it's a lot of fun, you know,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   being together, exercising, and it's not just, like,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   a bunch of dudes lifting weights, but it's, like, fun choreographed stuff.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   But typically, the way that class works is there's an instructor, right?
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   There's an instructor that you have to, what?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Follow.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Is that hard?
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Well, sometimes, if you go to the classes with guys who are uncoordinated,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   you're like, "It is so hard for them," you know?
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Well, a lot of times, it's just not that hard.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   I mean, in the sense that this--
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   there's only two things that could really go wrong.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   One, you're not paying attention, okay?
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   You're, like, too distracted by the guy who can't bend his body,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   and he's just not--there's no dexterity in him, he's not fluid,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   and he just can't do this.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   You're just all distracted because you just keep looking at him.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Or maybe you're looking at a cute girl,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   or there's all these mirrors and stuff, so you're looking at yourself.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   You're looking at something different, so you're not paying attention to the instructor.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Walking in the Spirit means you're paying attention to the Spirits leading in your life.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   I am talking about the Spirit like a person.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Earlier I mentioned, He is teaching us, He is guiding us, He is empowering us.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   He's going to take the Word of God and be like, "See?"
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   That's what He's doing constantly.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   You need to pay attention.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   So, yes, the Scriptures tell us, "Fill your mind with the Word.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Let the Word of God dwell richly in you," right?
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   The book of Proverbs, huge chunks of it, "Pay attention, give ear, listen, heed this thing, listen up,"
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   all this kind of stuff.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   So many parts of Scripture is, "Pay attention."
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   That's what the Scripture is telling us.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Listen to the Word of God and pay attention to it closely.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Otherwise, what? You can't walk in the Spirit.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   It's just that simple.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   But secondly, obviously, when you're in that classroom,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   yes, you might be looking, but you might just be looking.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   You're not practicing.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   And the thing about it is, with choreography, there is time.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   There are linked motions.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   And so, obviously, if you're not practicing one thing, you're not going to get the next thing
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   because one fluid motion leads to another.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   And if you're not in the practice, you can't follow.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   You can't do the step, right?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Likewise, you know what the Scripture says?
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   That people in godliness discern what's right and wrong by practice.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   That when you are at home, and let's say--
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Sometimes I have these convictions.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   I go home, I'm pretty tired, and the kids want to play or something,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   and my temptation is, "I want a veg."
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   I'm just being honest with you.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   I love my kids, love my wife, count it the blessings upon blessings to have a family,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   but there are days when I want a veg.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   You feel me, right?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   And then I get this little voice in the back of my head.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   It's like, "They haven't seen you all day.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   You should spend some time with them."
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   And then I have a decision to make.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   I've got a decision to make.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Is that hard to confess?
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Is that hard to notice what it means to walk in the Spirit versus my flesh?
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   It's not that confusing.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   It's not that confusing.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   And Apostle Paul, I think, therefore just tells us, "Walk in the Spirit."
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   And he's not dissecting what that all means because he, I think, automatically knows
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   if you are a Christian and you have the Spirit of God who is an active living person
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   doing all of that spiritual ministry to you,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   you should understand what it means when he says, "Walk in the Spirit."
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   If you really have no idea what that means, then we have deeper issues, right?
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   If you have no idea what it means to heed the Spirit versus your flesh,
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   we have deeper issues than what's at hand.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   But Apostle Paul is saying that.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Let the Word just deeply and frequently saturate your thoughts
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   so that the Spirit of God will use those words.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   And through prayer and communion, you are in tune with Him.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And then when those moments come where you have the conviction,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   the Spirit coming up within you, then your actions are now derived from what?
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Someone cornering you saying, "You better do it or I'm going to spank you."
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Like, is that what's happening? No.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   You have the Spirit of God saying, "This is good. Golly, this is in the form of Christ."
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   And you are yielding to that.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   That is spiritual fruit.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   That's what we want.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   And that's actually what I trust.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   I trust that the Spirit of God is powerful.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   And the Spirit of God will produce that in you.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Now, as we think about this a little bit, I want to encourage you.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   That as we think about this a little bit,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   the Spirit of God in this struggle that I'm trying to say is already victorious.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Right?
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   The Spirit of God is not going to lose to sin.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   The Spirit of God is not sitting there having a battle saying,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   "Oh my goodness, this is yin and yang, 50/50 chance."
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Scripture tells us that the Spirit of God is in us and He is greater than the world.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   The Spirit of Christ is in us.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   He's already overcome.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Now we need to walk in that.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   And so I want to just encourage you guys.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   If right now I'm saying, "Hey, walk in the Spirit,"
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   and you're thinking like, "Dude, man, that is way harder than you make it seem."
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   I get that.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   But let me be an encouragement to you and say,
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   God's designed for us.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   It's not normally supposed to be failure after failure
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   and disappointment after disappointment.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   And we're just getting bruised and beating at every corner.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   What actually should be the normative is that, yes, we are sometimes bruised,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   and yes, sometimes we do fail,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   but there is a progression of greater and steady walking with the Spirit in success.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   That should be the norm.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Amen?
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Now I want to bring us to this point.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   We're saying, "Walk in the Spirit,"
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   but Apostle Paul is going to highlight why that is so important.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   And it is something that is obvious to us,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   but something that we need to reiterate.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   So point two--the first point was just simply walk in the Spirit.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Point two is you are in an intense battle.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Okay?
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   You are in an intense battle.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   In verse 17, he says,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   What is he talking about there?
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   He says there is such a conflict,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   not so much that there is a yin and yang,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   but that the flesh is hostile to anything spiritual.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   That's how I read that passage,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   because he says the flesh is trying to prevent you.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   The flesh is actively trying to stumble you.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   The flesh is trying to prevent you from doing what is godly.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   That's what that passage says.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   And so what I would like to say is that's the nature of the beast.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Okay?
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Let me repeat that.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   That's the nature of the beast.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   The flesh is hostile.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   And if you turn over your Bibles to Romans 7,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Apostle Paul in another book explains that pretty thoroughly.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Okay?
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Romans 7.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   I wish I had the time to read you the entire chapter and chapter 8,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   but I'm going to highlight for you some things here.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   So go to Romans 7, starting from verse 5.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Okay?
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Starting from verse 5.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   And in Romans 7, it says,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   "For while we were in the flesh,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   the sinful passions were aroused by the law."
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Do you see that?
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   He says, "So while you're in the flesh."
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Now, is he talking about pre-salvation or after salvation?
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   I have my personal opinion about this,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   and I'm going to present just a little bit,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   but it applies to both.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   You are, if you're a Christian,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   a redeemed soul living in fallen flesh yet to be glorified.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   You're in the flesh.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   If you're not a Christian, you are absolutely in the flesh with no struggle.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   The flesh is just overpowering everything.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   And you will indulge all of your desires,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   and you will have no control, no power,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   because the Spirit's ministry is not in you.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   And he says that when this flesh, with all of its sinful passion,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   is exposed to the law, what will happen?
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   It will be aroused.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   You see that?
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   And so he says that this sin and the sinful passions which are aroused
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   were at work in the members of your body to bear fruit for death.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   But now we have been released from the law,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   having died to that by which we were bound,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   so that we will serve the newness of the Spirit
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   and not in oldness of the letter.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   So through context, my personal take is chapter 7 is all about pre-salvation.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Let me move forward, though.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Take a look at this, verse 7.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   "What shall we say then? Is the law sin?
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   May it never be!
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   On the contrary, I would not have come to know sin except through the law,
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   for I would not have known about coveting if the law had not said,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   'You shall not covet.'
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   produced in me coveting of every kind."
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Jump to verse 11.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   "For sin, taking opportunity through the commandment,
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   deceived me, and through it it killed me."
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   Take a look at 13.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   "Therefore did that which was good become a cause of death for me?
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   May it never be! Rather, it was sin!"
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   You see this point?
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   The law in and of itself is not going to be banished.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   And so all these free grace people who are like, "Every law is bad," wrong!
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Jesus himself said, "The law is to be fulfilled, not jettisoned."
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   But when sin comes, the nature of the beast comes out,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   and he goes, "Arrgh!"
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   If you imagine, I had a dog one time.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   I was not a good trainer.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   I was a high school student when I had my last dog,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   and every time I opened the door, it's gone.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   And then me and my brother would go chasing it down,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   and then we have to corner the thing.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   And then once we corner the thing, what do you think the dog is going to do?
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   He starts backing up, trying to go this way or that way,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   and then we come over and grab him, and he goes, "Arrgh!"
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   That's sin.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   (Laughter)
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Guys, I'm trying to make a serious point here.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   When the law, although it is spiritual,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   comes to a sinner who has unrepentant sin in his heart,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   that sin is going to be aroused,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   and that sin is going to take chance and opportunity and rear itself,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   and that is the fruit of the flesh.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   And that is sometimes what happens.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   And so he says there is this battle
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   that the flesh is in opposition to the Spirit,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   and you need to be aware that the flesh is not just kind of like,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   "Oh, sometimes I fall."
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   It's not just like, "Everybody does it."
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   It is hostile to you and trying to overtake you.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   And so you see how the apostle says it's so important for you to walk in the Spirit
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   because you have this enemy causing you to be an enemy of God.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And we have to be cognizant of that.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   And that flesh, that flesh,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   we realize it's not just like base sexual desire.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   It's not just the stuff of impulse.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   That flesh, so to speak, is comprising of all the depraved perspective of the world,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   all the systematic things that we believe.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   It's even in our depraved emotions.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   It's in our depraved expectations.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   And yes, it's also in our depraved desires and passions.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   These things cannot control us, but rather the Scripture says
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   we need to put them to death.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   We need to put them to death and we need to fight them.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   If you take a look, come back to Galatians,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   and take a look at verse 24,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   Apostle Paul says in verse 24 that,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   "Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires."
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Okay?
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   These are not things for you to keep around.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   These are things that you need to crucify.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   In that verse, it says that those who will belong to Christ
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   have crucified the flesh with its passions.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Who is doing the crucifying?
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   In the Gospel, we know that God is the one who crucified sin,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   meaning He took care of sin.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   It says in Colossians that He took the certificate of debt,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   all that is against you, He nailed it to the cross.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   That is God's work.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Amen. Praise God.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   But then He says, when you walk in the Spirit,
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   those who are in Christ and truly Christian will take your sins
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   and you will continue to place it there and keep it there
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   and you will not have pity on your sin.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   You are not going to have remorse over you letting go of your sin.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   You are not going to look back on your sin with fondness,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   but you are going to kill it,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   because crucified means kill.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Right?
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   And that is what we need to engage in.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   We need to have a resolute, decisive repentance that kills sin.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   I have been in the last several days and the last several weeks
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   thinking much about what it means to be truly godly.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   I have been thinking very deeply about what it means to be truly spiritual,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   truly holy, right?
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Like a true man of God.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And the fact of the matter is,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   if an individual deals with sin and is half-hearted,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   is permissive of sin, is unrelenting of sin,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   that individual's godliness is going to shoot down the toilet
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   and we will all of a sudden realize, maybe, the Spirit of God is not there.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   Because in the next verses, what we see is a depiction of it.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   So the next portion is verse 19 through 21,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   and I am going to call it "The Works of the Flesh."
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   And to set it up, you guys have seen boxing matches and MMA matches?
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   There is always that guy with a really cool voice,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   "Ladies and gentlemen!"
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   And he says, "In the blue corner, weighing in at 170!"
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   That is my weight.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   "Weighing in!"
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   "Is the flesh of Mark Lim!"
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   And then on the other side is going to be the Spirit,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   the person who is walking in the Spirit.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   And he is going to depict the two as, "This is a battle,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   and here I want you to see what this individual is."
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   And so let's read it.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   He says in verse 19,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   "Now the works of the flesh are evident,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   idolatry and sorcery,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   I warn you as I warned you before that those who do such things
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   will not inherit the kingdom of God."
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   What we are going to do is,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   there is no way I am going to tackle every single one of those characteristics of the flesh.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   And I am not going to because I want to be honest.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Just like for a true Christian,
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   it should not be such a confusing thing.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   What does it mean to walk in the Spirit?
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   To a true Christian, it should not be such a confusing thing.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   What does it mean to be envious?
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   I do not know.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   You know.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Every time you look at somebody and be like,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   "I wish I had that."
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   You know exactly what it is.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   We know it when we see it in our kids.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   When one kid is like,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   "How come he has the bigger toy?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   How come he has the thing?"
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   You have one.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   He is like, "I do not care. I want that one."
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   Envy.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Most of these we already know.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   We do not have to dissect them to really know.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   But we are going to go through them to get a depiction.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Because Apostle Paul kind of puts them in categories for us.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   He puts them in categories for us.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   The first is the passions.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Sensuality.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   He says sexual immorality, impurity, and sensuality.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Lumping them together.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   It is all passion behavior, lustful behavior, sexual behavior.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Some of these you guys are well aware of.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Probably you guys have heard that there is this term, "pornea."
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   But that term, what you realize is that it is a perversion.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Truthfully speaking, we live in a quite perverse generation.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   We really do.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Things that are supposed to be deemed completely adulterous,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   completely sexual immoral.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   People have perverted everything that God has deemed right and appropriate
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   for a marriage relationship between a husband and a wife.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Then people have just dramatized all sorts of nasty sexual perversions
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   and then put them up on movies for people to see.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   That word for impurity, it literally means unclean.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Like an infection oozing with pus.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   That is what you would call.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   That is what this generation again struggles with.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Now, the reason why I am going into the definitions of some of these things
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   is because I want you to keep thinking.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   This is produced by what?
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Where is this stemming from?
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   If I am saying all the generations like this, well, the generation is like this,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   but also I know that many in the church wrestle with sexual perversion.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Whether it be premarital sex, whether it be pornography,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   there are perversions of sexual sins in the church.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   I am not going to be naive about that.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   But Apostle Paul is saying this is evident of what?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   It is your flesh. You know it is an inside job.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   But many people in the church today start pointing to outside stuff.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   It is because my work is so hard. It is because I cannot handle this.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   It is because... and then when they go to secular counselors,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   it is because of the way your parents treated you when you were young.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Really?
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   It is because of the way your father treated you.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   It is because of suppressed this and that anxiety and this.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   No. We have to recognize that the Bible is teaching
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   these perversions at its root come from our flesh.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   It comes from our sinful state.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   What is more, Apostle Paul points out that there are idolatries and sorceries.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   In my mind, these are all stuff of the man-made religion.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   This is the stuff where I want to dictate what I want to have
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   as my paradigm for my life.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   That is why I get to say that my God is this guy that I can make.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   I can put him right here.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   My God is this guy who is going to give me this.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   My God is this guy who is going to give me that.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   That is idolatry at its core.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Sorcery is the same thing in the sense that the Greek...
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   I am not going to say all the Greek terms and stuff,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   but we get the derivative of pharmacy, pharmaceutical.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Essentially, all he is talking about is drugs that sedate you,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   drugs that make you feel a certain way.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   That is essentially idolatry.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   That is what all idolatry amounts to.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   I go to this and worship this, things feel better, good.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Then that is your pagan religion at core.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   I go do my religious thing, I feel good, feel sedated, I am out encouraged.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   That is man-made religion.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Then here are the things that come up where he lists a bunch of stuff
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   as the things of the flesh.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   He says these are evident of the flesh,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   clear indicators that your flesh is reigning.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   He says there is enmity, there is strife, there is jealousy, fits of anger,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   rivalries, dissensions, divisions, and envy.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Here is a moment for us to really check our hearts.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   My wife is right there, so I have to be honest.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Am I sometimes hostile? Yes.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   Enmity means hostile.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   She is like, "Hey, could you do this?"
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   "You know what, Tara, I might not want to."
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   Sometimes she wants to encourage me with something,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   and I come off like, "OK, sure."
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   There is that kind of hostility where it is passive aggressive.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   There is other kinds of hostility.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   "What? You got something to say to me? You want to fight? Let's go!"
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   There is that kind of hostility. We do not really do that at home.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   I am just saying, if you have that kind of mentality,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   you are a hostile person.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Please do not chalk that up to, "Well, that is what people need,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   that is how I am, that is my personality."
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   No, that is flesh.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   Why are you willing to fight with your brother?
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   That does not make any sense for a man with the Spirit.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   What is more, he talks about strife, which is just discord,
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   jealousy, you know.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   It is in the Ten Commandments.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   People have struggled with this all their lives.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Just recently I read a little Shakespeare book for my kid,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   King Richard III, where in fits of jealousy, the man is murderous.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   I leaned over to my son and said, "The book of James talks about that.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   You want stuff, you do not have it, you get jealous and you kill people.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   That is what it is."
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   That is what that is.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Fits of anger, where you have temper tantrums,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   where you want to get your way because,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   and then you do not get it, so what you do is you get angry
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   so that you end up getting it.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Rivalries, where you try to one-up each other.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   You try to compare, compete.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   You try to outdo one another.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Dissensions, divisions, and envy, and that list.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   I know it goes on because he says, "And there is more."
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   But let us do a heart check.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   Because if you are an angry person,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   I know that overcoming anger is hard.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Sometimes trying to say, "Okay, I am just going to put it to death,"
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   that one is truly easier said than done.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   The reason why I say I know that is because I am not actually an angry person,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   but I am a prideful person.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   I know how difficult it is for a prideful person to try to overcome his pride.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Because ingrained in pride is the element of self-preservation.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Ingrained in pride is, "Me, I want to appear."
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   It is self-exaltation. It is self-preservation.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   It is the advancement of self.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   Trying to overcome it is incredibly difficult.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Why do I bring that up?
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   It is because if you feel like rather than you having a hold on your sin,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   you feel like your sin has a hold on you,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   then let this be a challenge to you.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   We have to recognize that it is not just something I am going to wrestle with the rest of my life.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   It is flesh.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   I have to be that serious, that devoted to addressing that sin.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Then I have to be that devoted to walking in the Spirit in that sin, against that sin.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   What I mean by that, for example, is there were times, yes,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   like as a young man, I can be open with you.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Have you ever struggled with lust?
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   "Pastor Mark struggled with lust?"
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Yes, I have.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   As a matter of fact, when I was in college,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   everybody knew, "Hey, this guy, he has got potential,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   but that is a big sore spot in his life."
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   I just confess that to you guys.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   I am going to tell you honestly, I was so broken by that stuff.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   When I saw that sin in me, I cried.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   I cried and I broke and I sat at the back of the church,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   feeling it, like, "Man, I am not worthy to be here."
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   If any of you guys have any broken relationships,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   or you guys have past, a history in that, you guys know exactly what I mean.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   But then when it came to the sin of arrogance,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   I just kept speaking it.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   If somebody said it, I was like, "I know it is there.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Tell me something new."
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   It is like, "What? Do I dare deem one sin greater than the other?
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Do I dare think that because I have one element of my flesh in check and the other,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   it is just okay?"
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   No. And that is what I mean by, when I think of godliness,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   I think of Jesus' admonition, "If you want to be my disciples,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   you must deny yourself and carry the cross and then follow me."
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   But then that idea of denying myself is then contained
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   when I look at all of these fleshly sins.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   Because what is common among these is,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   the individual who desires to overcome this must deny all of himself.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   And so the godly man understands the extent of Christ's call.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   When he says, "Deny yourself," it does not mean just your money,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   it does not mean just one facet of yourself.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   When he says, "Deny yourself," it goes much deeper and much further than we presume.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   And then the godly person who is truly godly will understand the necessity to do so,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   that he must kill and he must carry his cross and kill his sin,
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   and then he must follow the footsteps of Christ.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   That's a godly man who understands the depth of that.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   So that's the working of the flesh that we see,
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   and what it does is just reveal something.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   And what does it reveal?
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   And that was the end of his list, which he said,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   "Just like I forewarned you, I told you about this,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   that such a person who practices such things will not inherit the kingdom of God."
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   I find a need for us to be sobered by that statement.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   Because truth be told, do we have thoughts?
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Do we have fantasies that are sinful?
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Do we have temptations and inclinations in our hearts that are sinful?
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   Yes.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   What Apostle Paul is talking about is,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   there are those individuals who have it, but because of the spirit that is restrained
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   and that is overcome and they're victorious.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   And then there are those individuals where that produces action.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   There's a conduct based upon that sinful thought, attitude, and belief,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   and then once that conduct is habitual, now you have a character,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   and what it reveals is you are not Christian.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   You are not saved, and you will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Is Apostle Paul being too harsh?
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   No, he is not.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   Turn your Bibles to Matthew chapter 7.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   Again, this is a passage that's probably quoted a lot, to sober people up.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   And I don't want to just necessarily beat a dead horse, so to speak,
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   but we need reminders of this to continue to keep us sober.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   And in it, in Matthew chapter 7 verse 15,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   Jesus himself said, "Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   You will recognize them by their fruits.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   Are grapes gathered from thorn bushes and figs from thistles?
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   So every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into fire.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   and cast out demons in your name and do many mighty works in your name?'
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   Depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'"
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Earlier in the list of sins of the flesh, the fruits of the flesh,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   he mentions drunkenness and orgies, and that is lawlessness.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   Lawlessness, that's debauchery, that's dissipation, it's lawlessness.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   And he says, "You workers of lawlessness, go away because I never knew you."
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   So what does Jesus say? Throughout history, from Judaism to Christianity,
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   those ravenous wolves who came into the church, they didn't come out like,
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   "I'm a wolf." They always came out like, "I'm a messenger of God doing God's work."
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   So is that a danger for the church? Absolutely. Is that a danger for me? Yes.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   And I need to make sure that I understand what the Scripture says,
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   that habitual pattern will only prove me to be an enemy of God.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   So I have to kill it at the root where it begins in my attitude, perspective, and belief.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   There's another passage I want to just simply read for you for the sake of time.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   It comes from 1 John 3, verse 4 through 10, and it says,
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   "Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness."
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   Sin, essentially, is lawlessness.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   And then he says, "You know that he appeared in order to take away sin,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   and in him there is no sin. So no one who abides in him keeps on sinning.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   No one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him."
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   That's Scripture. That's Apostle John, the apostle of love,
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   telling us that he who makes a practice, who makes a pattern,
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   who has over a long period of time habitually done all the things that we talked about,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   whether it's hostility, strife, jealousy, idolatry, sorcery,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   or whether it's all the sensualities, that person is not Christian.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   That's what he's saying.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   And he says, "Little children, let no one deceive you.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Whoever practices righteousness is righteous."
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   He's righteous.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   "Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   for the devil has been sinning from the beginning.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   No one born of God makes a practice of sinning,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   because he has been born of God."
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   Again, I just want to make clear, that does not mean you're going to be perfect.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   But that means that when you are confronted with sin and there is temptation,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   if you say, "I can't help but do it," you're not Christian.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   And what's more, if afterwards you're not able to see that what you did is a sin,
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   then you're not Christian.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   But the genuine Christian is going to say, "Although maybe before I failed,
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   I have the Lord Jesus Christ and his Spirit whom he sent
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   to teach me between godliness and ungodliness,
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   and the Scripture says in Titus 2 that we have been taught to say no,
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   and that is the work of the Holy Spirit in us.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   And we have to make sure that that voice, "No," is clear
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   and that we continue to heed it and walk in it. Amen?
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   And that's what we're talking about today.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   And so by contrast, in the boxing battle, it says,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   "Here in this corner is this fleshly man, and ultimately by pattern he is not Christian."
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   But on the flip side, there is a man who is filled with the Spirit,
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   and this is the way he describes him.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   Coming down to Galatians 22, "But," here's the contrast,
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   "but the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   Against such things there is no law."
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   Amen.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   How beautiful are the fruits of the Spirit.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   How beautiful is this list.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   And I want to name something to you.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   This is different from a gift of the Spirit.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   This is the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Let me repeat that.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   This is a fruit of the Spirit, not just simply a gift of the Spirit.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   And what difference does that make?
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   The difference that it makes is this.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   The Scripture says in 1 Corinthians 12 and all the way to chapter 14 repeatedly
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   that the gifts of the Spirit are varied and in different degree.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   The Lord gives to you according to His measure.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   But the fruit of the Spirit is what He does to you and produces
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   by the simple nature that is in you.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   So what does that mean?
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   That this list is not, "Oh, man, when I get disciple and I get to degree number 3
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   on the Christian level, after 5 years of learning and being under the tutelage
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   of this disciple and that disciple, I'm going to start being gentle and kind."
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   No.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   This is what norm of every Christian should be.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   That is what God is saying.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   This is the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   When the Spirit is in you, at least to some growing degree,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   this should be apparent in you.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   So that when someone looks at you, they shouldn't be thinking,
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   "Is that guy Christian, man?"
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   No.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   The person who is looking at you should be like, "Dang, for sure he's Christian."
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   Why?
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   "Because I see the fruit."
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   Right?
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   This is what should be the norm of every Christian.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   And I'm going to be honest.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   This is like--the Book of Galatians, I did my personal devotion through it,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   so that's why I'm preaching it.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   And I sat there, and I was really convicted.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   Again, because of my pride, some of those things, I'm like, "Pretty good.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   I feel like I'm a pretty patient guy."
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   I can sit and listen to people who are long-winded.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   I can sit and endure through discomfort.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   If someone's in my way when I'm driving, I don't just blow,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   but I can just kind of wait.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   But some of the other stuff, I mean, man, I really excused myself there.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   I didn't really holistically think about this.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   But you know what's really crazy about this list?
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   If you look at the word "fruit" and you look at the verb "is," it's singular.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   God sees this as a fruit.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   All of it together, holistically in you.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   So God is not desiring some lopsided Christian who says,
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   "Well, I'm good at this. I can teach pretty good and wax really eloquently,
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   but I can't do this stuff, but that's okay because this is me."
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   No.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   God desires for you to have a holistic growth that every single one of these spiritual fruits
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   that's listed here, everything from the love, where you should have such a care,
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   that you're willing not to simply to--in contrast to the lust,
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   where in lust we just want.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   We just want stuff. We just want to be satisfied.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   We just want experience.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   We just want to be satiated and stuff.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   Love is giving.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   I give you my affection. I give you my care.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   I give you my attention.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   I give you everything. I give you what's best for you.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   That's love.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   And by doing that, I'm happy, I'm content, and I feel all my affections for you.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   That's love.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   We should have that.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   We should have joy.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   I'm going to be 100% honest.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   I feel like, strangely, we live in a very privileged world,
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   but people are really sad.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   A lot of people who are just not happy.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   They're just disappointed.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   They're kind of like dragging their knuckles.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   And some of them are even--many Christians these days experience depression.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   Many experience this overwhelming cloud.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   But we are to have a kind of joy where, yes, we're going to feel pain in this life.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   That's for sure.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   We're going to feel sorrow. That's for sure.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   But he says you have this treasure.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   You have, you know, banked in you, deposited in you,
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   this spirit that you can turn to for that comfort and joy
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   that is independent of the many painful experiences you have in your life.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   And all the situations that could thwart you and kind of trip you up,
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   you have this treasure in you, right?
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   That's the way we need to look at it.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   We have a kind of peace where, again, it's not the kind of peace
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   where you go to a nice, peaceful lake, you throw your fishing pole in there,
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   and it's like, man, life is good.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   That is not peace.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   But we have a kind of peace where even if we're in pain or suffering,
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   that we can have peace.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   We can have patience.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   There should be kindness in us.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   There should be goodness in us.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   There can be gentleness in us.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   That we are so controlled by the Spirit of God
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   that even our tone and way we say things,
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   that we care so much about other people and we're so loving
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   that the way I'm doing things, I'm considered,
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   is this going to hurt you even if I think you need it?
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   I am even careful of how I give it to you, right?
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   That should be the kind of marks of the fruit of the Spirit
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   because that is the characteristic of our God, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   And these are the things that should be wrought in us.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   That should be wrought in us.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   By wrapping up a kind of bit here,
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   it says in verse 25 through 26 as a way of summary,
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   "If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit."
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   Again, keep in step with the Spirit.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   And then verse 26,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   "Let us not become boastful, challenging, and envying of one another."
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   As I was studying this passage, I asked this question,
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   "Why is verse 26 where it is?"
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   Shouldn't verse 26 be over by verse 21
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   with the rest of the relational problems?
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   I want to say two things about this.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   Number one is that in your life,
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   you're going to probably hit several things
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   that are common pitfalls for every Christian.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   And we know these to be the common pitfall for most.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   One of arrogance and pride, right?
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   One of conceit, as some of your translations would say.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   You're just conceited.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   And I want to talk about that a little bit
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   because I bet you, because Apostle Paul is talking to a church
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   who has made a living, or so far has made a system
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   by which they're able to measure their spirituality
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   by their external self-righteousness,
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   perhaps there is a guy, like Jesus was talking about in Luke 18,
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   where some Pharisee is saying,
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   "Yeah, preach it. Preach it to those sinners."
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   But thank God I'm not like them.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   Right?
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   When the pastor is saying, "Maybe you're not Christian."
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   Like, "Oh yeah, that one guy, maybe he's not."
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   If you're thinking that, you're conceited.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   And you, just like that guy who's in the class,
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   but he's so busy looking at somebody else,
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   "Ha ha, look how much that he sucks."
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   He is shipwrecking or he is ruining his experience
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   because he's not following the instructor either.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   And many a people in Jesus' time,
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   in the time of the apostles,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   and time today do that too
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   because of their conceit and arrogance,
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   they don't think this message is for them.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   But rather, they can name all the tons of people
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   where this message needs to be heard.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   "Preach this, you know.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   When were you the last time I dealt with this guy?"
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   You're conceited.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   What's more, he says,
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   don't be challenging one another.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   Don't have this kind of animosity and rivalry with one another.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   I'm going to tell you probably,
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   the greatest source of pain is going to be from your flesh,
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   and within that category of your flesh,
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   do you remember which one was the biggest?
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   Your personal relationships.
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   Your personal relationship is where you're going to feel the most pain.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   Your personal relationship is where you're going to feel the most trouble,
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   the hurdles that you need to overcome.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   And Apostle Paul says,
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   walk in the Spirit and do not be challenging towards one another.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   And what's more, in terms of your desires,
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   keep them in check.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   He says, do not envy one another.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   He says, don't be conceited.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   Don't provoke one another.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Don't constantly be inviting that combat.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   And lastly, he says, do not envy.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   Do not look on your brothers and sisters with,
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   "I wish I was that. You have it so good.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   Why do you have it so easy? Gosh, you spoiled little..."
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   Sometimes we do that.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   We just constantly look at each other.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   And I think that's...
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   Actually, I just recently read this book called
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   "When People Are Big and God Is Small."
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000]   And it talks about the common pitfall of people.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   "Oh, you know, that guy is being so love, but what about me?"
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   People are way too big, you know?
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   "How come no one is reaching out to this and no one is reaching out to that?"
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   People are way too big.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   Now, by way of wrapping up,
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   I want to give you this encouragement from Ephesians.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   I'm just going to read it for us.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   It says, "Therefore, do not become partakers with them.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   For at one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   Walk as children of light.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   For the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   And try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness,
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   but instead expose them.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   But when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible."
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   I'm going to tell you this.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   We, in 21st century, in Christendom,
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   we have become really good at hiding things in the dark,
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000]   especially the stuff of our flesh.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   But Scripture is absolutely clear, and I believe it.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   Everything you do eventually comes to light.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   I don't actually ever care if people talk about the stuff I do,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]   because you know what I say?
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   It's going to be known anyway.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   Anything that is private knowledge, it's actually going to become public knowledge.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   I don't doubt that at all.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   But that then gives me more impetus.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   That even the stuff that I do in private, if it is fleshly, I must deal with it.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   As a child of the light, I must walk in the light,
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   for this pleases our God.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   Amen?
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   Let's pray.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   Father, we want to thank you so much for your grace to us.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   Lord, we thank you, God, that in your grace,
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   you have given us your Spirit,
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   so that it would continue to resonate in our minds and in our hearts
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   what is right, true, and godly.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   Father God, we thank you so much for that.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   And Lord, we trust that the work of the Spirit is powerful,
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   and that the Spirit is capable to produce the fruits that you have spoken of in Scripture.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   Only God, help us not to stand in the way and be resilient,
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   but God, help us to be truly repentant, broken, and moldable.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   I pray, God, that we would be able to see transformation in our lives
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   through the work of the Spirit.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   And Lord, would you continue to do that in your grace, patience, and kindness to us.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.080]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:59.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
