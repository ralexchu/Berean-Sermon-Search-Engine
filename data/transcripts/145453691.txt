[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.200]   Pastor Peter and I go way, way, way back, high school years, and like 20 pounds ago.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.400]   Same height, both of us from high school.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.480]   That hasn't changed.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.120]   And we grew together in the Lord.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.640]   He actually led me to Christ in 1989.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.640]   He discipled me.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.280]   We lived together and ministered together.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.600]   And actually, Esther, his wife, discipled my wife, and they're both school teachers.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.600]   It's like uncanny.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.600]   It's crazy.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.000]   And now, like the next generation of Shins and Kims are hanging out together.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.840]   Like Faith and Elizabeth are like Facebook friends and Kakao friends, and they hang out.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.440]   And then like a year ago, Peter and I played Zachary and Jeremy in two-on-two basketball.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.320]   I don't know if they're here today, but the older generation won.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.400]   I don't know if they let us win or not, but it doesn't matter.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.400]   We still won.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.400]   And I'm never going to play them again.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.400]   I'll just leave it at that.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.000]   I'm going to be one and O, and that'll be the end of it.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.840]   But it's a joy to be with all of you.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.840]   All of that was nothing.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.120]   It was just fluff.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.680]   If you open your Bibles to Colossians chapter 3, and we just have one verse.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.720]   Whole sermon on one verse.
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.280]   Chapter 3, verse 5.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.160]   Do you guys usually stand for the reading of God's Word?
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160]   Or what do you guys usually do?
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.160]   No?
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.160]   Okay.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.160]   Okay, that's fine.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.160]   You guys relax.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.160]   I'll just read up here.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.960]   Colossians 3, 5.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.560]   "Put to death, therefore, what is earthly in you, sexual immorality, impurity, passion,
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.280]   evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry."
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.440]   Sovereign, holy, gracious, loving Father, we come to you now, and we ask for your help.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.840]   For we know and believe that you have said that unless the watchman builds, the watchman
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.640]   watches in vain, unless you build, the builder builds in vain.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.240]   And so all of our study, all of our efforts to understand your truth and apply it to our
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.320]   lives are all in vain without the assistance, the empowerment, and the help of your Holy
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.520]   Spirit, the paraclete, our counselor.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.240]   So we pray that you would fill us with your Spirit, that you would lead us by your Spirit,
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.240]   that we would walk in step and be led by your Spirit, and so that you will receive all the
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.700]   glory for our time together and all the fruit that is produced in time.
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.400]   So therefore, Lord, we again commit this hour to you as we study and as we listen, but our
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.680]   hearts are praying, our hearts are looking to you, and that you might go before us.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.040]   And Lord, open our eyes to see the wonderful things that are in your law.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.240]   We thank you, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:56.320]   Well, I distinctly remember I was about 20 years old, a year old in the faith.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.360]   I had a few open Sundays, so I went out to E.V.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.840]   Free Fullerton, pastored then by Charles Swindoll.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.040]   You guys know Charles Swindoll?
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.040]   Okay, good.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.400]   Some of you guys know Charles Swindoll.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.960]   And he was a godly man, a faithful expositor, so I went to his church and was encouraged
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.920]   by the service and the sermon.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.120]   Afterwards, I went to the bookstore and I wanted to buy like a souvenir sermon from
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:31.080]   the church, so I went to the tape section and asked to buy a sermon tape.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.560]   You guys know what cassette tapes are?
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.560]   What are you guys talking about?
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.080]   What are you talking about?
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.440]   Before CDs and MP3s, there was a thing called a cassette tape.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.920]   It was like a rectangular plastic thing that had wheels and you put it in your car.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.160]   You had to fast forward and rewind to get to the right part of the song or the sermon
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.000]   and you would listen and eventually it would wear out and you had to buy another one.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.880]   So I asked a lady to buy a sermon tape and she asked me, "Which sermon do you want?"
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.860]   And I said, "I don't have a particular sermon in mind.
[00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.040]   Can you pick one for me?"
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.480]   It was an older lady in her 60s.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.280]   She looked at me and she went to the back and she brought out a sermon for me to purchase
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:25.800]   and I looked at the tape and the sermon title was "Plea for Sexual Purity" from Psalm 51.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.800]   And I looked at her and said, "Really?
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.800]   That obvious?
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.040]   What are you trying to say?"
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.400]   And I kind of blushed and she was like, "Oh no, I'm not pointing you out or anything."
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.200]   But she just was blessed by this sermon and she thought I would be helped by it as a young
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   man.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.200]   Well that was 25 years ago.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.160]   If you can do the math to see how old I am today, that was over 25 years ago.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.440]   And I listened to that sermon many times and it's been very helpful to me.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:06.200]   And as an older woman, a godly woman, she knew by her life what kind of challenges I
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:14.520]   would face as a young man trying to walk in Christ, to mature as a godly man, to grow
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.120]   in my faith.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.800]   You guys all know Psalm 51.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.160]   You guys know 2 Samuel chapter 12.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.840]   David was tempted by Bathsheba.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:32.000]   He tempted himself and he committed adultery and he was ensnared in his sin to a degree
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.640]   where he had Bathsheba's husband Uriah murdered.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.520]   And Uriah was not just any old soldier in his army.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.160]   Uriah was one of the mighty men of David.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:50.200]   When David was hiding from King Saul in the wilderness of Ein Gedi, God sent many young
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:57.160]   men to fight with and fight for David and one of the men that God sent was Uriah.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:06.000]   So Uriah was a long term friend, fellow soldier in David's army and David betrayed Uriah,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.600]   had him murdered because he slept with Bathsheba, his wife.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.440]   And from that point on he was never the same again.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.900]   King David's life was marred from that point on.
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:29.000]   He became a shell of himself, a man who had entered into the army of God by fighting the
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.140]   giant Goliath and defeating him with a stone and a sling, was reduced to a man who was
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:45.800]   running away from his kingdom, Jerusalem, barefooted, being cursed by Shammai and overthrown
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.400]   by his son.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:57.760]   All because of what happened on that faithful evening when he committed this heinous sin.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.760]   Apostle Paul understands the importance of this issue in the Christian life.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:13.000]   That if we want to grow as a believer, if we want to be effective ministers of Christ,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.960]   if we want to be evangelists and missionaries, before we try to fight the war out there,
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:25.280]   we must be engaged and overcome and be victorious in the battle within.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.960]   The front lines of spiritual warfare is not out there in the world.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.340]   It's not in Hollywood.
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.120]   It's not in Washington DC.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:40.800]   The front lines of spiritual warfare is in our hearts.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.680]   Is right here inside of us.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:55.000]   So we must experience private victory if we want to experience victory in the world.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.920]   Paul is saying that sin is not outside coming in.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:07.480]   Sin is inside coming out.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.200]   That is what the Pharisees could not accept.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.440]   That is the truth that the Pharisees could not receive.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.560]   For them, sin was outside.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.360]   Sin was in the Gentile world.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.400]   Sin was in society, in the culture, in the world.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.080]   And they were pure and they were holy, godly, righteous, biblical.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:33.840]   And so they were committed to obeying the Bible as a way of maintaining their righteousness.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:39.320]   And one of the key commands they obeyed was dietary laws.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.480]   And Jesus said in Mark 7, sin is not outside.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.520]   What goes inside of you does not make you unclean.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.120]   What makes you unclean is what flows out from your heart.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:09:01.680]   And out of your heart comes all sexual sin, immorality, impurity, malice, jealousy, hatred,
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.680]   anger, slander.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.240]   Sin is in our hearts coming out.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.920]   And the following metaphor, illustration that Christ gave was if your right eye causes you
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.480]   to sin, gouge it out.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.040]   If your left hand causes you to sin, cut it off.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:26.800]   Because it's better for you to enter heaven maimed than for you to go to hell as a whole
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.560]   person.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:35.280]   So Christ called his disciples to take a radical approach towards all sin.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.640]   But the problem is that our eyes are not the source of sin.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.600]   It's the means by which we sin.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.040]   Our mouth is not the source of sin.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.500]   It's the means by which we sin against others.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.760]   My right hand doesn't cause me to sin.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.760]   My right hand is the means by which I sin.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.760]   Right?
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.720]   Where does sin come from?
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.040]   If it was my right hand, it'd be easy.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.280]   Just cut it off and the issue is solved.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.600]   But the problem is sin is in our hearts.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.160]   Sin is coming out.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:20.280]   And we can't cut out the heart because it's the source of our physical life.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.280]   Not the heart.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.240]   We cannot live.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:32.000]   Therefore, the predicament that you and I are in is that we are sinners.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.800]   We will be sinners until our death or the return of Christ.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:47.480]   But we must not approach our flesh with an idea of truce, with an idea of negotiating
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:53.240]   with our flesh and finding out some way of compromise where we can win-win.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.240]   Right?
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.360]   Flesh, I'll let you win.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.400]   You know, I'll let you have some areas of my life.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.320]   Let me have some areas of my life.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.240]   And we can both have what we want.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:08.080]   No, that is not acceptable because sin wants to be killing you.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:13.360]   Sin has only one agenda, one objective, one focus.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:20.000]   And that is to undermine your Christian faith, to shipwreck you, lead you astray, and to
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.920]   mar your Christian testimony.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:30.400]   That's why Pastor John Owen said, "Be killing sin or sin will be killing you."
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:37.680]   Here the Apostle Paul said to us, "Put to death, therefore, what is earthly in you."
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:45.440]   The only acceptable mindset towards what is fleshly in us, earthly in us, the flesh is
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.440]   mortification.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.760]   The Greek word is nekros.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.240]   Make a corpse out of your flesh.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.240]   Right?
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.760]   Go for the jugular vein.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.120]   Don't try to live with sin.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.000]   Don't compromise with sin.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.160]   Do not negotiate with sin.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.160]   No, you must seek to put it to death.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.680]   You must try to mortify it, make a corpse out of it.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:21.360]   Now, there is some conflict here because if you go to Colossians chapter 2 verse 12, Paul
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:26.200]   just told us that we were buried with him in baptism.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:32.440]   That we are crucified, that we have died, that we have been buried with Jesus in our
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.880]   spirit baptism.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:39.960]   Not only that, in chapter 3 verse 3, it says, "You have died."
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.960]   Verse 3, "For you have died."
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:48.160]   Paul, you tell us we're dead and now you're telling us to put to death?
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.240]   How are we to understand this?
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:58.440]   To illustrate this, I must appeal, I must go to Korean cuisine.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:05.920]   I am Korean American and an area of my life where I'm very Korean is my love for Korean
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.920]   food.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.360]   I love all Asian food.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:13.480]   Thai food, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, they're all right there.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:19.640]   But when I'm really hungry, nothing hits the spot like Korean food.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:29.480]   But even though I love Korean food, there is three dishes that's difficult for me.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:34.120]   One of them I eat and two of them, one of them I tried, I will not eat again.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.040]   And the third one, I will not even try.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.840]   The one that I eat for a while, I couldn't eat for a while.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.960]   When I was in high school, I used to eat a lot and I stopped for a few years.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.520]   It's a ggori gomtang, an oxtail soup.
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.520]   Oxtail soup.
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:53.080]   When I was in high school, I remember eating it with my family and loving every bit of
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.080]   it.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:59.120]   You know, the bone, you would chew on it, get every piece of the meat, drink the soup.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.160]   And I just loved ggori gomtang, oxtail soup.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.800]   And then one day in college, somebody told me that this is oxtail soup.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.280]   And I never connected the dots.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.480]   I don't know, I'm just like slow, I'm just eating.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.200]   I'm slurping so I don't hear what they're saying.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.200]   But I heard it's oxtail.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.920]   So I'm like, wait a minute, this is a tail of an ox?
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.280]   And I look at it and it's round.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.480]   And I think of an ox and it's a tail.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.320]   And I'm like, oh my goodness, that's gross.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.320]   Right?
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:34.160]   Who's the first Korean guy that looked at an ox and said, man, that tail.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.040]   Let's try to cook this tail in a soup and eat it.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.600]   And I understand Korea back in the day was a poor country, so they had to eat every part
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.920]   of the tail, the part of the cow.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.240]   But we're not poor anymore.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:50.120]   We can have the prime rib, we can have the sirloin, the rib eye, we don't have to eat
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.120]   the tail.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.960]   Why are we doing this?
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.720]   So for several years, I just could not do it.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.760]   And then one moment of weakness, you know, like in my college years, I gave in and started
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.520]   eating and I just tried to erase the picture of that poor cow without the tail.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.200]   And it was so good.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:15.000]   The second cuisine that I tried once and I will not eat again is gopchang, pig intestine.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.960]   Some of you guys are like, what?
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.560]   That's the best thing again.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.560]   Right?
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.200]   We're a billion people in the world.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.960]   Their religion says don't eat pigs.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.960]   Why?
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.960]   Because they're filthy animals.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.960]   Right?
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.120]   They live in their own excrement.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.080]   They live in their own, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:44.040]   So they consider pigs such dirty animals, you're not to eat pork.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:53.120]   Well Koreans not only eat pork, they want to eat, they eat the intestines of a pork.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.120]   Intestines of a pork.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.120]   You guys understand what I'm saying, right?
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.380]   So when you guys eat gopchang, you know what you're eating.
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.640]   So I had a Korean barbecue about a year ago.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:04.320]   My friend ordered gopchang and he's grilling it on the grill and I'm like, oh man, that
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.440]   thing's touching my, you know, chadolbaegi.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.720]   It's touching my, you know, like Hawaiian steak.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.480]   And it's like popping, right?
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.200]   It's got like, you know, it's just popping.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.200]   It's over, it's like greasy.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.200]   And he said, try it.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.200]   I said, all right.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.600]   I'm going to add up.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.320]   I tried a piece.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.320]   It was okay.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.320]   It was decent.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.320]   It was okay.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.320]   Maybe good.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.720]   But it's not like pig intestine good.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.720]   Right?
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.280]   So I'm like, I'm never eating that again.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.600]   That story's too long.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.920]   The third cuisine that I will not eat is live octopus.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:41.560]   Did you guys hear, did you guys see this in Andrew Zeran in Bizarre Foods?
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.960]   Korean, you go to a Korean restaurant, they serve Korean octopus, live octopus, and they
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.800]   cut it up.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.720]   And instead of like frying it or grilling it or boiling it or baking it or doing something
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.680]   with it, they serve it raw.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.680]   And it's moving.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:02.200]   And so the Koreans get that octopus and they dip it in gochujang, of course, right?
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   And they put it in their mouth.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.000]   And as they're chewing, the tentacles are all moving, like sucking on the mouth and
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   the outside.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.200]   And you have to chew it finely because if you don't, as it's going down your throat,
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.320]   it'll stick to your throat.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.440]   It could be like hazardous to you.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.840]   And I'm like, oh my goodness, that is not something that I want to, I don't want to
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.080]   eat anything that's still moving.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:30.280]   But that is the picture of our Christian life and the flesh.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.440]   Think of the live octopus next time you think about the flesh.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.640]   That octopus is dead.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.640]   It's cut up.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.840]   It's moving, but it's dead.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.520]   You can't like glue it back together and say, oh, it's a flesh wound.
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.520]   It'll be all right, octopus.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.000]   I'm going to feed you and give you water.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   You'll be okay.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   No, no, no.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.960]   No amount of like CPR or like whatever is going to help that octopus.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.960]   It's dead, but it's moving.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.880]   And that is a picture of our flesh.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.880]   We have been crucified.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.440]   Galatians 2 20.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.480]   I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.280]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.160]   I have been buried with him.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.440]   Christ was crucified on the cross.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:20.000]   Our sins were crucified on the cross and every believer was crucified with Jesus on the cross.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.760]   We are dead and raised with Christ.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.200]   It cannot be undone.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.640]   We cannot lose what God has given to us once for all.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:36.480]   Yet at the same time, practically, functionally, in real time, the flesh is alive and well
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:44.960]   in your life and my life, waging guerrilla warfare and has power, has strength, has great
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:52.680]   influence to tempt us and to cause us, lead us to sin.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:19:00.520]   And the kinds of sins we're talking about is not like minor sins where the flesh is
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.760]   so weak it could only tempt us to sin like small white lies.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:11.440]   No, the kinds of sins that Paul is talking about in verse five, he lists them sexual
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:20.640]   immorality, pornea, general war, word for fornication, all illicit sexual sin, impurity,
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:30.960]   like uncleanness, passion, it's pathos, evil desire, cacos epithemia, evil lusts.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:38.120]   We're in our flesh, there's all these lusts that rage against us, wanting us to pursue
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:43.120]   these sinful things, covetousness, which is idolatry.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.720]   Paul is saying this is in you, right?
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:52.160]   Look to death therefore what is earthly in you and we could, Pastor Peter's preaching
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:57.920]   through Romans, you'll get there in Romans 7 and Paul says it is a law that when I want
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:03.360]   to do what is right, sin is right there inside of me.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.320]   I cannot run from my flesh.
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.320]   I cannot hide from my flesh.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.440]   I cannot hide from these base impulses of the heart.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:21.120]   They are right there and it's very foolish for us to think that we can somehow contain
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:27.240]   and control sin by way of some human or earthly measures.
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:33.480]   We were reminded of this truth just a few months ago and I mentioned his name.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.800]   I am not condemning this man.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.240]   He is, I believe, a brother in Christ.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.040]   I am a greater sinner before God than him.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:48.320]   I am no way, I hope not demeaning him but we all heard of Josh Duggar, right?
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.800]   And so Josh Duggar is the oldest son of the Duggars.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.800]   You know, you guys are shocked that we have six kids and it is pretty shocking, right?
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:02.160]   We actually own, we drive around a church van, a 12-seater, right?
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:07.040]   We had a, you know, a Honda Odyssey, a 7-seater and there was no seat for me, right?
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.040]   I was like, kind of like discouraged.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.040]   I was like sad.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.480]   I was like, there is no chair for daddy.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.440]   So I had to drive in a separate car.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.960]   But after a few months, I actually liked it.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:21.320]   Like I am by myself, listening to sports radio and my wife is like, you know, with the seven
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.320]   kids.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:29.840]   But, so we actually bought like a huge van, a 12-seater and so one of the families that
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.200]   we looked up to were the Duggars.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:38.040]   They had 19 kids growing up in Arkansas and though they were, they had a TV show, they
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:46.600]   didn't own a television, they didn't watch TV or movies, they didn't have internet access.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.920]   So their kids grew up like little house in the prairie, right?
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:56.440]   So they actually went to this amusement park and they saw this like display of how people
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:01.960]   in the West dressed like 100 years ago and it was comical because the way people dress
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.520]   100 years ago and the Duggars were very similar.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:10.800]   It was like they were going back and forth in their dress, their modest clothing was
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.800]   eerily similar.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:17.960]   That's how conservative, biblical, they were homeschooled, house churches.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:25.040]   Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar are godly believers, trained their kids in the Lord and their first
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.880]   kid, you always do your best job in the first kid, right?
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.400]   All the first borns, you get all the pressure, all the standard and your parents burn out.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:39.840]   Like our sixth, she is like out of control because we're just too tired to train her,
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.280]   teach her, discipline her.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:48.000]   But the first is where your full focus goes to in parenting and yet Josh Duggar became
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.320]   this leader, like a politician, a family values man and it turned out he had two accounts
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:23:02.040]   in Ashley Madison, repeatedly committed adultery against his wife and it all came out in a
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.400]   sort of detail on the internet.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:13.880]   And that's a vivid reminder that yeah, you can take your family to a compound, cut off
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:22.480]   all internet, cable, radio, secular music, secular influences, raise them in homeschooling.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:28.440]   I'm not going down to homeschooling, we homeschool, but you do all of that and to think that you
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:37.360]   are safe from sin is, is foolishness.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:49.040]   Paul says here that put to death what is earthly in you, it is inside of you right now and
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:56.160]   if you deny that reality, that is to your own detriment.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:01.360]   I think most men would humbly acknowledge the reality of these temptations of the first
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:07.160]   four, immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:14.600]   And I have counseled so many couples where the guy was caught with pornography and the
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:21.120]   wife is all like grieving and sad or the guy committed adultery and I'm counseling them
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:34.480]   both and the guy just feels so, so awful and at the same time the wife is just angry.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:39.920]   She is condemning the husband, understandably to some degree, but for a lot of women, it's
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.680]   hard for women to understand, guys, what's wrong with you guys?
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.680]   All right?
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:50.560]   You know, some women's response to this is like, just stop it.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.880]   Get a hold of yourself.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.880]   What is wrong with you?
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.880]   You guys are dogs.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.040]   You guys are like monsters.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.200]   Why do you have so little self-control?
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.040]   What is so difficult here?
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.040]   Right?
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.400]   Just a little bit of discipline, just stop.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.760]   Control yourself and turn away what is so difficult.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:17.080]   And one of the temptations for women, whether in the family or in the church, is to become
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:24.600]   very proud and judgmental and self-righteous because they see the flesh powerfully at work
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:32.000]   in the lives of men and really making them passive, making them just passive and carnal
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.200]   and worldly and they cannot understand it.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:41.440]   I really think this is the mental health issue of our generation.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.120]   The previous generation was smoking for decades.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.840]   People didn't know the harmful effects of smoking.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.200]   And in fact, in the 50s, you had anxiety or insomnia.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:59.440]   Doctors would actually prescribe cigarettes as a way of helping you cope with anxiety
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:04.320]   because they didn't know the carcinogens that was in tobacco smoke and how harmful it would
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.320]   be.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.600]   And only later did we find out, oh, it was an epidemic.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:15.160]   The cancer-causing agents of cigarette smoke is such that now we realize how harmful it
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.160]   is.
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.840]   Well, I believe in 10, 20, 30 years from now, if not already, we'll look back and we'll
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:24.960]   see that addiction to pornography is an epidemic.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:33.160]   It is the root cause of insomnia, social anxiety, depression, bipolar, all these psychological
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:40.960]   terms, all these men becoming passive and shallow and self-centered and not being active
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:47.040]   spiritually and not being leaders is tied to their shame and guilt over this hidden
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.200]   sin.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.960]   And it's the pervasiveness of pornography.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.360]   It's the first time in human history that this has occurred.
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:57.880]   Or pornography is pervasive, is ubiquitous, right?
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.440]   It's everywhere.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:05.040]   It's two buttons, two pushes away on the internet and it goes with you on your smartphone wherever
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.040]   you go.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:15.200]   And I think it's coming to understanding how an epidemic it is in the lives of so many
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.080]   people.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:25.560]   And women have a hard time understanding this and they can become very judgmental and frustrated.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.960]   Here's a little pastoral homiletics.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:33.600]   I have some commentaries to back me up on this, but I can't say here with 100%, but
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:40.840]   I think there is some aspect where Paul made this list and the first four is dealing generally
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:41.840]   with men.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:47.160]   Not absolutely, no, but generally men struggle with the first four, but he included the last
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:56.200]   one for the female believers of the Church of Colossae, which is covetousness.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:03.040]   Now not absolutely, but generally covetousness is a temptation and a vice that women struggle
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.400]   with.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.400]   Not so much with men.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:10.800]   Like men, I don't covet his shirt.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.480]   I don't notice that hairstyle.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.600]   Man, I wish my hair was like that.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.360]   Like oh, his body figure.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.560]   Wow, that's a nice body figure.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:22.560]   Guys usually don't.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.560]   We dress for ourselves.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.520]   We dress for comfort.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.880]   We don't notice each other's like, I don't know, biceps.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.480]   Maybe some of you do, but I don't.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:42.560]   But women, not absolutely, not every woman, but generally women are so relational, they're
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:46.040]   constantly comparing themselves with others.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:51.800]   They're constantly noticing other women's eyebrows.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.160]   They notice their hair color.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:59.680]   They notice their personality and their relationships and their godliness, and they're constantly
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:04.880]   comparing themselves with others.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.760]   Comparing other people's success and ability.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:12.520]   And men struggle with too, but generally more so with women.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:16.480]   This is, as Paul says, it's earthly.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.880]   It's sin.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.040]   Someone said it is a sin that nobody talks about.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:25.120]   Another pastor said it is called the mother of all sins.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.200]   It is a deceptive sin, unsatiable sin, all-consuming sin.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.680]   It is a hidden sin.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:36.280]   Immorality, we know, we struggle, we know it is sin, but covetousness is so deep and
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:44.760]   dark and hidden, and many are unaware that this is the root issue, the core issue of
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.120]   sin in their lives.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:54.360]   It is an uncontrollable sin, sin that keeps growing, and Paul referred to this sin as
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.760]   the sin that he could not conquer in Romans 7.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:03.280]   When God said, "Do not covet," there was a converse effect in his life where all these
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:09.800]   covetous desires rose within him.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.680]   And Paul calls it idolatry.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.520]   Paul is not referring to all five vices here.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.840]   He's referring to covetousness.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.880]   This is idolatry.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:27.640]   This is breaking of the most important command, which is, "You shall have no other gods above
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.640]   me."
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:33.960]   This is a violation of the greatest command, which is, "You shall love the Lord your God
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.320]   with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength."
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:46.480]   This is actually displacing God from His rightful place as one we worship, and worshiping, adoring,
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:51.360]   pursuing, delighting in something else, it is idolatry.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:58.400]   DeMart Loyd-Jones said, "Idolatry is anything that you and I tend to set up as the big thing,
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:03.720]   the central thing in our lives about which we think and dream, the thing that engages
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:09.680]   our imagination, the thing that we live for, the thing that gives us the biggest thrill.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.800]   If it is anything other than God, it is idolatry."
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:21.720]   Luther said, "Whatever your heart clings to and relies on, that is your lowercase God."
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:27.800]   Tim Keller said, "An idol is whatever you look at and say in your heart of hearts, 'If
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:32.760]   I have that, then I'll feel my life has meaning.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.920]   Then I'll know I have value.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.200]   Then I'll feel significant and secure.'"
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:43.600]   There are many ways to describe that kind of relationship to something, but perhaps
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:48.160]   the best one is worship.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.000]   Idol is, "If I have that, then I'll be happy.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.640]   Then I'll be content.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.440]   Then I'll be secure.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.120]   Then I will feel beautiful.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.080]   Then I can have peace and joy."
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:05.240]   And that is idolatry.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:11.360]   That is a grievous sin against God.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:19.320]   Women, if I were to say to you, "Just stop it.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:23.800]   Stop comparing yourself to other people.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.840]   Stop being so idolatrous.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.400]   Stop coveting.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.400]   Stop looking at others.
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.600]   What's wrong with you?"
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.600]   Would that resonate with you?
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.840]   Would that be helpful to you?
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:42.720]   Can you just turn the switch and turn it off and not covet?
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:50.760]   No, you'll say, "Pastor James, it is a brokenness that is in me that goes so deep that I fight
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:57.880]   and fight and fight, and it is a constant struggle."
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:01.520]   So just as it is with men, it is with women.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:10.200]   The flesh is not a simple sin that we can overcome easily.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:17.240]   So the million dollar question is, "How do we put to death all that is earthly in us?
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.400]   How do we make a corpse out of the flesh?"
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.560]   Some will say, "You starve the flesh.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.480]   You starve the flesh and you feed the spirit."
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.080]   Now, understand me.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.920]   I'm not saying this is absolutely wrong or it's unadvisable.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:36.600]   There are helpful things here where people say, "Don't watch movies.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.600]   Don't listen to K-pop.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.720]   K-pop is a source of the flesh.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.720]   Don't listen to...
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.280]   Don't watch Korean drama.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.000]   You become dramatic when you watch Korean drama.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   Don't hang out with worldly friends.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.800]   Don't go to Fashion Island.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.120]   That's where all the covetousness resides.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.920]   Avoid these places.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.040]   Instead, come to church.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.040]   Read the Bible.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.040]   Pray.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.040]   Listen to sermons.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.720]   Listen to praise music.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.040]   Starve the flesh and feed the spirit.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.040]   That's how you mortify the flesh.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:15.300]   And I would say, Galatians 3.3, is that how you are saved?
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.400]   Is that how you receive the Holy Spirit?
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.080]   By starving your flesh?
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.720]   By fasting?
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.800]   By praying for weeks on end?
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.440]   Is that how you receive the Spirit of God and have your sins forgiven?
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:34.600]   By avoiding sinful places and going to places that were holy and righteous?
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:40.400]   Is that how God worked this miracle of regeneration in your heart by the works of the flesh?
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.840]   And Paul says 10,000 times, "No!
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:50.560]   You receive the Spirit by faith and are you now being perfected by the flesh?
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.840]   May it never be!"
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.840]   No!
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:35:01.160]   We began by faith and we are to continue by faith and not by works.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:07.480]   To think that we start with Christ and we continue reliance on our flesh.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:12.800]   To Paul, that is not Orthodox Christianity.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:17.240]   Some would say you mortify the flesh by some ecstatic experience.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:23.280]   Through some Gnostic, esoteric, spiritual encounter with the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:27.560]   Where you go to the highest point of the mountain and you wrestle with Satan.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.400]   You yell at him and rebuke him for days on end.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:37.840]   And afterwards, an angel visits you or a special man or woman prays for you and anoints you.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:42.720]   And you receive this anointing and from that point on you experience victory to victory.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:51.360]   You're an overcomer and you have risen above the fleshly impulses of the heart.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.360]   And you become an overcomer.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.240]   That's how you grow as a Christian.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:59.720]   And I would say, "No, that is not it at all."
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:06.200]   Some would say that the way you overcome the flesh is by way of theology.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:14.160]   Going to seminary, learning Greek and Hebrew, reading Bonson, reading Van Til, reading these
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.600]   esoteric French Christian philosophers.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:24.360]   So if you immerse yourself with all these truths and become biblical, become conservative,
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:31.440]   become faithful to the Bible, then you will overcome the flesh.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.280]   I have some time here.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:38.000]   Remember when Nathan rebuked David?
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   And Nathan's smart.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.080]   Nathan, if he says, "You sinner," David will say, "Give me your head and it's over."
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:52.040]   So Nathan goes to David very wisely and he says, "King David, I have a story to tell
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.000]   you about what's happened in our nation."
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   And David says, "What?
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.520]   There's these two men and one man is rich and he's got thousands of animals as part
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:02.960]   of his property.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.080]   Another man is poor.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:09.400]   He only has one ewe lamb and this lamb is so precious to him that he's considered a
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.880]   part of his family, like his own daughter," it says in 2 Samuel 12.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:21.560]   "Well, the rich man had a visitor and instead of sacrificing one of his animals, he stole
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:29.880]   that one ewe lamb from that poor man and had it slaughtered for his traveling friend."
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.640]   And David is incensed.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:40.880]   David is so angry and his response is, "That man must repay the poor man fourfold of the
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.360]   value of that ewe lamb."
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.680]   Where did he get this from?
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.400]   This is from the Mosaic Law.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:49.600]   If you steal from someone, you must recompense, right?
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:54.160]   You must pay a penalty four times what you stole.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:38:00.280]   But then David also said, "That man deserves to die.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.760]   That man deserves to die."
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.760]   What?
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.200]   David, he didn't kill the man.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.760]   He didn't kill his daughter.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.160]   Are you misunderstanding?
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:16.080]   The ewe lamb was like a daughter, but it was still an animal.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.120]   So he just stole property.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.440]   David says, "That man deserves to die."
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:25.160]   Wow, why so strong?
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.480]   Why so harsh?
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:32.480]   Commentator said, "Derek Kinder, it's compensatory zeal."
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:40.480]   So when you feel David was in sin for a year, he knew what he had done.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:45.160]   He was so ashamed, so guilt-ridden, he was so afraid somebody might find out that when
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:50.400]   this came about, he compensated by being overly righteous.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.440]   This is so wrong.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.280]   This is an incredible injustice.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:58.720]   This man deserves to die for killing a lamb?
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.360]   David, you are the man.
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.200]   You didn't just kill a lamb.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.120]   You committed adultery and you killed a human being.
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:10.800]   You killed your loyal friend, Uriah, and you covered this up.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.800]   You are the man.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.560]   Do you deserve to die?
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:21.920]   People that struggle with sin, private, hidden, constitutional guilt and shame, they cover
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:30.520]   up their compensatory zeal by being overly righteous, overly conservative, overly traditional,
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:35.960]   and demonizing the other side, and making a mountain out of molehill, and judging and
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:46.160]   condemning, and casting down verdicts of condemnation, pointing fingers as a way of covering up their
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.200]   guilt, their shame, and their sins.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:55.280]   And this happens by way of theology, by way of ministering in the church, serving the
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:58.480]   church or other good works.
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:02.280]   For many, it is all a way of covering up their sin.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:07.920]   And they think because they are so immersed in good works, because they are so righteous
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:14.040]   and biblical, somehow their flesh is mortified.
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:18.840]   I would say, let's be biblical here.
[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.440]   Let's go back to the Bible.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:25.800]   I'm not saying all of that is wrong in of itself, but what does the Bible say?
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:30.080]   Here verse 5 tells us how we are to mortify the flesh.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:33.040]   Put to death, therefore.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.280]   Therefore, put to death.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.640]   This is how you put to death whatever is earthly in you.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:46.680]   The way to mortify the flesh is found in verses 1 through 4.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:52.440]   1 through 4, put to death, therefore, whatever is earthly in you.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.560]   This is how we mortify the flesh.
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:01.220]   Colossians 3, 1 through 4, "If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:04.960]   are above where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.360]   Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth, for you have
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.160]   died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:17.720]   When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory."
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:21.440]   Verse 1, "If then you have been raised with Christ."
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.680]   That is an important qualifier.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.840]   Are you a believer?
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.460]   Are you a Christian?
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:35.400]   If you are not a Christian, the reason the flesh is alive and well is because the flesh
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.200]   is alive and well.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:43.920]   The reason you privately in the hidden places of your life are powerless against the flesh
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:50.600]   is because you are still a foreigner, an alien to Christ's salvation.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.720]   You are still completely in the flesh.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:58.000]   So could it be that you are not in Christ?
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   That's the qualifier.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.960]   "If then you have been raised with Christ."
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:06.360]   That also has a secondary reference to believers.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:12.240]   Where some believers, they're Christians, and yet they are immature baby Christians.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:19.000]   They are still trusting in Jesus who is either still on the cross, there's no cross here,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.820]   okay, still hanging on the cross, or he's still buried.
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:29.160]   So their functional faith, their real time faith is not the risen Christ.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:35.360]   They are still grieving, they are still mourning, they are depressed, they are downtrodden
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:43.000]   because the Jesus that they worship is still being crucified or is in the grave.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:53.920]   No, the orthodox faith is Christ died and was risen and right now he is alive.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.760]   He is not in the grave.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.700]   He is not a fading memory.
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.080]   He is not an ancient historical figure.
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:01.080]   He is not dead.
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:08.000]   The Jesus that you and I believers believe in and worship is alive right now.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.380]   And not only that believers, we have risen with him.
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:17.220]   We have experienced the power of his resurrection in our Christian lives.
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:24.580]   For some believers, they're still looking for Jesus in the grave, in the cemetery.
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:28.720]   If that is you, then you need to receive the risen Christ.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:32.240]   You need to believe in the resurrected Christ.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:36.240]   Christ that is alive now through the spirit in our hearts.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:41.800]   And you must also experience being raised with him in the power of his resurrection.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:46.640]   Now if that is you, you are a believer and you have been raised, you have conviction,
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:51.200]   you have assurance, you have been struck by gospel lightning, you have experienced the
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:57.040]   power of resurrection, if that is the case, then now you are ready to mortify the flesh.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.520]   What is the first way you mortify the flesh?
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:01.520]   This is a general one.
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:07.440]   You seek the things that are above and you set your mind on things that are above.
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:14.640]   You seek and you set on things above, not what's inside and not what's below.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:23.400]   Guys, if you live your Christian lives looking inward, then you will be very depressed, very
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:28.320]   discouraged, you will be dejected, you will burn out, you will lose heart.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:32.600]   You have a short Christian life ahead of you if you live your Christian life looking at
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:38.960]   yourself or if you live your Christian life looking at the world and how fallen it is,
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:42.040]   how corrupt, how sinful it is.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:47.880]   No, the way to mortify the flesh is not by looking in, not by looking at others, not
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.120]   by looking at me.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:55.720]   No, the way to live the Christian life is by looking up, to seek and to fix your mind
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:58.600]   on above and who is there?
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:04.080]   It says here, seek the things that are above where Christ is.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.520]   Jesus is in heaven.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.000]   He is our hope.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.760]   He is the way through faith in Him by which we mortify the flesh and look at the posture
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.760]   of Jesus.
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:20.040]   Christ is in heaven and He is seated at the right hand of God.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.040]   He is seated.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:25.360]   The high priest when he went into the Holy of Holies had a no, he had no chair.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.520]   He's working, he's tirelessly working.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.520]   Why?
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:34.240]   Because the Israelites are continually sinning and the blood of animals have no power for
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.640]   remission of sin, Hebrews 7.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:45.680]   Therefore he has to every year offer sacrifices of animals and shed blood that had no power
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.680]   to forgive us of our sins.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:53.200]   But Jesus when He went down to the most holy place in heaven, it's the presence of God.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.360]   What did He do?
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.720]   He sat down.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.640]   Why?
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.880]   Because His work is done.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:07.640]   He went down to cross, He shed His blood once and for all and He cried out to tell us, "Die,
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.880]   it is finished.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.280]   Our salvation is secure."
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.800]   Once and for all.
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:21.520]   We are in Christ, we are saved, we are forgiven, past, present and future.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.640]   He doesn't have to keep dying for us.
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.440]   He doesn't have to keep bleeding for us.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:30.240]   He died once for all and He is seated.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:35.920]   And so seeing Him tells us that our salvation cannot be taken away.
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:45.520]   No matter how much I sin, no matter how much you fall away, we cannot exhaust God's love
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.080]   that is in the Gospel.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.800]   We cannot sin our way out of God's grace.
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:51.800]   Why?
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.800]   Because the work is complete.
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:00.160]   He is seated at the place of greatest authority, at the right hand of God.
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.040]   And what is He doing at the right hand of the Father?
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:12.120]   Hebrews 7.25 and Romans 8.34 says that Jesus always lives to intercede for us.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:17.120]   That right now, Jesus is praying for you by name.
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:23.840]   He's praying for you in your struggle against sin, in your struggle against temptation,
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.400]   in your moments of the dark night of the soul.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:32.520]   Jesus is seated at the right hand of God, the Creator, the Sovereign Ruler of all universe
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.840]   and He is praying for you.
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:40.760]   And just as Moses prayed for Joshua and when Moses prayed, Joshua was victorious to show
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.600]   that victory is the Lord.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:48.480]   But Moses was a man, he got tired and when his arms were lowered, Joshua would lose.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:54.280]   So men came alongside Moses to prop up his arms so that Joshua would be victorious.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:58.000]   But Jesus never grows tired.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.960]   He never slumbers.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:05.120]   He is never uncaring where He stops praying for you and me.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:12.680]   His eyes are always upon us and He's praying to the Father for us.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:19.720]   You see that, you believe that and you understand that your fight against the flesh is not dependent
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:20.720]   upon you.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:27.440]   But it's dependent upon Jesus who is praying for you because victory is the Lord and He
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.680]   can never, He never tires.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:34.760]   And He's praying to the Father not from far away but with His right hand.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:40.920]   To the degree you believe that and that faith makes it a reality in your heart, to that
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:44.040]   degree you are mortifying the flesh.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:47.920]   You are making the flesh powerless in your life.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:56.120]   Thirdly, we mortify the flesh, verse 3, for you have died and your life is hidden with
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.480]   Christ in God.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.280]   Do you believe this?
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.160]   That you are dead?
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:04.120]   That the flesh speaks to you?
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:07.920]   It seems powerful, seems effectual.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:12.160]   The gospel says, the Bible says you are dead.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:16.520]   Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, conviction of things yet unseen.
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:20.360]   Faith is not touching, not experiencing, not feeling.
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:25.760]   Faith is believing in the promises of the Bible and the Bible says we are dead.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.120]   The flesh is dead.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:33.020]   And not only that, we are hidden with Christ in God.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:36.240]   We are covered with His righteousness.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:42.840]   And when God sees us, He does not see our sins.
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:46.620]   He doesn't see the reason for guilt, the reason for shame.
[00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:50.040]   He doesn't see any spot or blemish.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.480]   He doesn't see anything wrong with us.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:56.960]   All He sees is the perfect righteousness of Jesus.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:02.480]   Luther equated with how dung covered in white snow.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:07.800]   Or similar Eustace at Pecator, simultaneously justified and sinful.
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:12.600]   We are sinners, we will be sinners until Christ returns or we die.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:18.160]   But the gospel says when we are abiding in Him, simply trusting in Him, believing in
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.320]   Him, being filled with the Spirit, we are covered in His righteousness.
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:32.040]   Where when God sees us, all He ever says is, you are my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:37.280]   In God's sight, we have perfect spiritual GPA.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:40.880]   You know, spiritual SAT, we scored perfect.
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.000]   We've never sinned against Him.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.400]   We've never wronged Him.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.720]   We've never doubted Him.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.760]   We never went astray in God's sight.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.520]   We are righteous.
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.720]   He delights over us.
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:55.760]   He sings before our presence.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.240]   Why?
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:02.480]   Because we are covered in Christ.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:11.240]   The degree you believe that, that God loves you and His love is unchanged for you because
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:14.200]   of Christ, not because of you.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.520]   To that degree, you're mortifying the flesh.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:20.400]   Flesh will have less power and influence over your life.
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.120]   You load your heart with guilt.
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:26.680]   You load your conscience with shame and guilt.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:29.480]   Momentarily, you will overcome sin.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:37.720]   Momentarily, you'll experience some kind of like growth against sin, but long term, it'll
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.200]   so discourage you.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:47.240]   It'll propel you towards sexual sin or propel you towards covetousness because the burden
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:53.720]   of guilt and shame to find respite from that agony, you will find yourself going to cisterns
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.480]   that do not hold water.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.040]   You are covered.
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.720]   You're hidden with Christ in God.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:04.540]   And the final way that you mortify the flesh is verse four.
[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:12.760]   When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:15.480]   This is a promise of Christ.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.560]   This is the promise of God.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:27.160]   He says nothing can stop you from appearing in glory before Jesus.
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:30.680]   Nothing.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:35.720]   Maybe about three years ago, I was at 24 Hour Fitness playing ball with some guys and I
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:41.840]   think I played one on one with a guy and I lost.
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.640]   I'm better than that guy.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.400]   In my humble estimation, I'm better.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:51.360]   I'm better, but the only difference is he's younger.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:54.120]   He's thinner and younger and he didn't lose.
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:58.320]   I lost my first four steps, so I'm holding on to my fifth step.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.320]   That's all it is.
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:02.280]   And as I was sitting there kind of like, "Oh man, how could I lose to that guy?
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.280]   I'm better."
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:08.640]   And I realized, man, in my athletic skills, I've hit the peak and I'm on the downward,
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:11.120]   I'm on the decline.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:15.160]   And so I'm like, I don't even know how to run anymore.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.160]   I can't even squat.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:17.720]   I can't even sit down on the floor.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:19.440]   My body is breaking down.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.680]   So it's sad.
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:24.720]   My athletic peak is behind me.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:27.720]   And I realized, man, I'm not as smart as I was.
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:33.000]   I was never very smart, but I'm not as smart as anymore.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   I'm forgetting things.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.280]   And so my academic intelligent peak is behind me.
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:41.680]   And I realized, man, in every area of my life, I was funnier before.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:42.680]   Right?
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:45.200]   I mean, everything in my life.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.240]   I hit my peak, I'm on the downward decline.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.240]   I'm like, "Man, that's sad.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:51.240]   It's kind of depressing."
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:55.120]   Except in one area, I have not yet hit my peak.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.520]   I am still ascending.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:58.520]   And what is that?
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.560]   It's the only thing that's important.
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:04.160]   It's my sanctification.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.160]   It's my faith.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.160]   Right?
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:11.360]   I will keep going up and I will one day be perfect.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:12.360]   I will be holy.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.360]   I'll be righteous.
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:15.920]   Now, who cares about basketball?
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.600]   Who cares about humor?
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.120]   Who cares about if you know calculus?
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.120]   Right?
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.120]   Does that matter?
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:22.120]   Tell your parents, "Calculus doesn't matter."
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:25.680]   The only thing that's important is our godliness.
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:30.200]   And the only thing that matters, if you're a believer, will never stop growing to the
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:33.360]   point where we will be in glory.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:36.440]   We will be like him, 1 John 2.2.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.620]   We will be righteous, without sin.
[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:43.120]   We will be the version of ourselves that God intended.
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:50.600]   The person without the anxiety, without depression, without self-absorption, without pride, without
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:56.560]   ego, without anger, without self-righteousness, without covetousness, without sexual sin.
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:03.480]   We'll be that person freed from all the vices of our flesh and we will be in glory with
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:06.560]   Christ forever.
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:10.120]   And that is not because we do something.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:13.000]   That is not because you fast a certain number of days.
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   No.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:20.160]   That is because that is God's promise that he wrote with the blood of his son and he
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:22.880]   will do it.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:32.160]   Nothing can stop believers from glory, from heaven, and from absolute righteousness.
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:41.040]   To the degree you believe that, to the degree the flesh will no longer have power over you.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:48.680]   The flesh will lose its influence, its grip upon your heart and you will escape the bondages
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:56.400]   of sin and you will experience God's kingdom here and now.
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:01.360]   There's got to be at least one person who says, "Pastor James, I agree with what you're
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:08.160]   saying but I've been, I'm so enslaved by this sin.
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:15.520]   I'm so ashamed, whether it's sexual sin or covetousness or other sins that I really don't
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.520]   have hope.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:20.400]   I have a hard time believing you, believing the Bible.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:22.120]   I'm so despondent and discouraged.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.120]   I've lost heart.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.860]   I've burnt out.
[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:26.240]   I want to look up.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:28.440]   I want to set my mind on things that are above.
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:33.000]   I want to seek the things that are above but I can't even lift my head."
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.520]   I'll close with Psalm chapter 3.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:45.320]   Turn with me to Psalm chapter 3 and this is God's word to you, if that is your heart this
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:46.880]   morning.
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:59.800]   Psalm chapter 3, verse 3, "But you, O Lord, are a shield about me, my glory and the lifter
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:02.640]   of my head."
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:08.280]   That is how beautiful, amazing, that is how gracious, kind our Lord is.
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.120]   He even lifts our heads.
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:15.560]   When we can't even lift our heads, He's the one who lifts our heads so that we might behold
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:16.560]   His glory.
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:21.280]   Where just like that woman caught in adultery in John chapter 7, where she's surrounded
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:29.360]   by her accusers with stones waiting to enact the capital punishment and Jesus says, "Has
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:31.120]   no one condemned you?"
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:36.240]   She's the only one who has the right and authority to condemn her because He said, "Whoever
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:40.160]   is without sin cast off her stone, they all left."
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.600]   She could not lift her head.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:51.320]   Jesus lifted her head and said, "Has no one condemned you and neither do I condemn you."
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:58.440]   He lifts your head and tells you, "Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who
[00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:00.320]   are in Christ Jesus."
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:08.320]   Christ came not to condemn sinners but rescue sinners, to forgive sinners.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:10.840]   Jesus only loves sinners.
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:13.960]   If you're righteous, then you spurn His love.
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:20.400]   Jesus came not for the righteous but for the sinful.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:26.960]   And if you are a sinner before a holy God today, then experience Him lifting your head
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:37.160]   that you might behold the one who loves you unconditionally so that through that love
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:42.280]   you will put to death all that is earthly in you.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:45.760]   Let's pray.
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:59:04.480]   Lord, there are times where we are so gripped with the base, hidden, dark sins of our hearts
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:12.960]   that we lose our way and we lose sight of the cross.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:19.640]   And in those moments our hearts are filled with horror and fear and we feel like it is
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:25.760]   a thousand mile journey to get back to the cross.
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:32.040]   But the reality is we are one step away from being at the foot of Calvary.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:36.600]   That when we turn to You, You run toward us.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:40.040]   That swift are the footsteps of mercy.
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:46.320]   And as the prodigal son's father ran to him, You run towards us a thousand mile distance
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:52.320]   in a split second if we just turn to You and look up.
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:58.520]   So Lord, no matter the state of our lives, may You find hearts that are humble and broken
[00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:06.520]   who will turn away from efforts of the flesh to overcome the flesh.
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:14.720]   And now turn to the Spirit, turn to Christ, turn to Your love and in You find the power,
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:22.200]   the beauty, the glory, the love to continue what You have begun in our lives knowing that
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.760]   You will do it.
[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:31.440]   Father may You lift many heads this morning and that way lift many hearts.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.640]   Lord, we love You, we thank You.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.080]   We pray all this in Jesus' name.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:35.680]   Amen.
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.840]   (chiming)
