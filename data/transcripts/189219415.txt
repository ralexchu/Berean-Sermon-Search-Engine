[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   We're on lesson six.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:14.040]   Last week, we were talking about handling the Word of God, and in the next, this week
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.480]   and even the next, we're still talking about that as in combination with our church's vision,
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.960]   but in just thinking about what was presented last time is just this idea that how important
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.960]   interpretation is of the scripture for us, right?
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.200]   As we think about our faith and what it's built upon as a foundation, and then also
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.280]   as we think about the authority that we receive from God, interpretation is incredibly vital.
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.980]   And one of the things that Pastor Peter mentioned was that accurate and clear interpretation
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.120]   is absolutely crucial because only when that interpretation is clear, so is the authority
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.120]   of God, right?
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.800]   Now, when we don't have accuracy and clarity in the interpretation of scripture, then that
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.200]   can surmount to only our opinions.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.060]   And so the authority of God that is the message given to us is also unclear.
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.520]   So really, the impetus is...
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.360]   Okay, hello, hello.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.600]   You know, I think it's an issue with my...
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.360]   I'm gonna try not to move.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.840]   All right, so the impetus is on us to make sure that we try our best to accurately understand
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.440]   the scriptures.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.400]   And another way I wanna put it is just to kind of, again, inspire us to make sure that
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.560]   we're actually digging is that in us trying to have that clarity is truly our hunger,
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.560]   you know?
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.120]   We're exercising not just simply a process of hermeneutics, we're exercising our thirst,
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.960]   we're exercising our desire for scripture when we try to approach it with the desire
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.960]   for right interpretation.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.160]   Now along those lines then today, we're gonna talk about one major aspect of biblical hermeneutics,
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.880]   and it's the lesson on genre, okay?
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.480]   On genre.
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.120]   Now in thinking about genre, I don't...
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.360]   Today is gonna be, you know, again, more like class time and talking specifically about
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.480]   the principles and guidelines for interpretation, but I don't want it to be something where
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.120]   it's like, "Oh man, that's just too much specifics and details that I don't have time to get
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.120]   into."
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.440]   Truthfully speaking, the things that we're gonna be talking about today, a lot of it
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.600]   is intuitive, okay?
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.500]   A lot of it you already practice.
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.920]   It's just an admonition for us to be both regular and consistent with our approach to
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.920]   scripture, okay?
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.800]   What I mean by that is, when we think about genre, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.720]   When you enter into a library, you know that you go to a certain section when you're looking
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720]   for a certain book.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:06.520]   The whole library is divided not by date, but the whole library is divided up by genre.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.960]   You have your fictional section, you have your teeny bopper stuff on one side, you have
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.320]   your children's books, and so forth, right?
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:21.920]   And you do realize that likewise, the scriptures, it's not organized strictly in a timeline.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.320]   A bunch of the Old Testament is, but actually the scriptures itself is collected by genre.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.080]   So instinctively, when we walk into even, again, a library or whatnot, or instinctively
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.000]   when you approach your Bible, there is this knowledge that within the text, there are
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   different types.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.760]   And so, I'm going to bust out my remote here, bam.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.680]   Essentially, when we're talking about genre, all we're talking about is the type of text
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.640]   that we're looking at, okay?
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.680]   The type of text has various elements that gives us the indication that it is a different
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.760]   type.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.200]   The first is content and the content style, okay?
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:13.400]   What we're talking about is, obviously, we have sentences and paragraphs, but what kind
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.200]   of literary devices, what kind of expressions and verbal elements is this passage using,
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.240]   okay?
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.160]   And so, for those of you guys who are English majors, you've got a heads up on us.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.560]   You learned about different types of literary devices.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.040]   You learned about whether it be idioms, or you learned about expressive sayings, or metaphors
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.800]   and similes, and all that kind of stuff, right?
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.320]   So that kind of expressive speech, the figures of speech in the content of the passage that
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.760]   you're studying, gives you an indication immediately of, hey, this could be a certain genre.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.760]   What's more?
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.360]   The form, okay?
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.320]   The form and structure.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.620]   Immediately as you open up, obviously, to the Book of Psalms, you see the sentence structure
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.280]   of its parallelism.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.560]   When you look at, you know, let's say even a narrative, you have different segments.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.080]   You have movements within it, and how it's organized, of whether there's a conflict and
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.520]   resolution, right?
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.200]   You look at even epistles, and you have a certain structure where a lot of times the
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.200]   apostle will write certain doctrines and then give you exhortation.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   There is a sense of form and structure to the writings that we see.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.520]   But one of the most important things is the function, okay?
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.040]   Understanding its intent and purpose.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.160]   What is this designed to do?
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.960]   And we realize that the biblical authors and God, as he ordained even the way that it's
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.800]   written, has an intent of writing certain things in certain forms, or I guess certain,
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.480]   you know, styles and types, so that it accomplishes a purpose.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.280]   Whether it's to illustrate, whether it's to give you clear teaching, whether it's to move
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.840]   you, inspire you, give you hope, right?
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.640]   The form matches its function, its purpose.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:13.720]   So again, all I want to say with this is that there exists in the scriptures literary genres,
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.560]   and it's very important for us to pay attention to them.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.080]   And I just want to say again, it's intuitive for us.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.160]   You know, I don't know if some of you guys are into like home decor, interior design,
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.320]   some of you guys into, you know, architecture and stuff like that.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:37.280]   When you walk into a house, you walk in and you understand living room, kitchen, right?
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.200]   And what that does for you is it starts to build essentially a framework.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.240]   You understand what kind of things should go.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.840]   Kitchen needs this, why?
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.840]   For its intended purpose.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.040]   Does that make sense?
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.920]   And so I use that example to show us that essentially the importance of understanding
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.720]   genre will help us have the right approach and expectation.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.320]   So on your packet there, there's a lot of blanks on the first page.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.960]   Somebody actually accidentally took my teaching notes.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.960]   You have all the answers.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.640]   But anyway, there's a lot of things on the first page here.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.240]   The first one there is underneath why it's important is because it guides our approach
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.440]   and expectation of the passage.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:24.900]   We realize and we have to confess that sometimes we're looking for something when we go to
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.640]   the text.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.280]   Whether it is because you're struggling, you need because you need encouragement, I don't
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.280]   know.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.160]   Different circumstances of our lives, in certain positions, we go to this text wanting to hear
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.680]   something, right?
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.600]   And in that kind of circumstance, it puts us in a dangerous situation.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.360]   But the genre and context of the passage is actually giving for us parameters of what
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.240]   we can actually expect from it.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   What's more?
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.340]   It helps us to understand the overall purpose and intent of that passage, okay?
[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:06.400]   It helps us to understand the overall purpose and intent of the passage.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:12.220]   And then lastly, it prevents us from making the kind of mistakes that oftentimes we see
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.340]   in Bible interpretation.
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:19.980]   A lot of times the mistakes are gonna, I'm gonna summarize as going out of bounds, right?
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.260]   Going out of bounds.
[00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:29.540]   Basically, what I'm presenting to you is that the study of genre helps us to build a framework,
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.260]   overall structure by which you can pretty much hang your, you know, your co-hangers
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:38.260]   and whatnot and have a little framework for you to understand the general whole and then
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:43.340]   to make sure also in terms of how you practice interpretation, you stay within its bounds,
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.340]   okay?
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.860]   Now, the next couple of portions I'm gonna go over quite quickly.
[00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:55.600]   If you look, I wrote down that there are many different types of genres found in the scriptures.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.980]   You look down the list and there's everything from history and narrative, there's the law
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:06.080]   and wisdom, and I'm not gonna take time right now to go over every single one.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.500]   You can take time to kind of read up on that.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.420]   And also, what I highly recommend is this.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.440]   At the end of your handout today, I put some resources down for you.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.020]   One of the resources that I really like is called Talk Through the Bible.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:23.620]   I used it when I essentially just worked through the Bible in a systematic way.
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.420]   And it's kind of like an expanded version of if you have a study Bible and it goes over
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:33.340]   background, historical context, author, major themes, right?
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:39.860]   Essentially, it's a expanded version of that that gives you a more thorough outline, multiple
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.020]   outlines, keys to this book.
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:48.620]   There are some pivotal verses to make sure you maybe even memorize and keep in mind as
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.560]   you approach that scripture, right?
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.200]   It's essentially a great help for you.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.840]   Now again, for a lot of you, that might be review and whatnot, but this is again important
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.640]   for us to make sure we understand at least by principle, this is how we approach scripture
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.320]   to interpret, okay?
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.460]   So there are many different types of genres found in the text.
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:12.200]   What I wanna make mention of is this, and this is super important, okay?
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.280]   Although in that list I give you, it's not exhaustive.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:22.560]   And what's more, even if I said, "Hey, there are parables in the Gospels," you do realize
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.360]   there are parables in the Old Testament.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.040]   When Nathan rebukes King David, he uses a little parable.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.840]   He says, "There was a guy who was poor and had one lamb.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:37.240]   This nasty king took the lamb," right?
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.080]   And then he made a very pointed point, he says, "That's you."
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.800]   Parables actually exist all through scripture, Old Testament and New.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:49.760]   What's more, even words of wisdom, these maxims and pithy statements exist all through the
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.080]   Gospels, in the epistles.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.300]   So what's my point with this?
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:59.760]   My point is, actually when you practice your interpretation and when you study the Bible,
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.400]   even the passage that you're at, maybe you're in the New Testament reading Galatians, okay?
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:11.480]   In that passage, you should be thinking, "What kinds of literary forms exist in my passage?"
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:16.320]   Because even as Apostle Paul is teaching us, he could be using illustrations, he could
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.280]   be using various devices to help teach.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.280]   Does that make sense?
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.280]   So in each passage, you should actually be taking care to make note of the genre that's
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.280]   there.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:32.800]   What we're gonna do today is look at two examples of these genres and see how it affects our
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.200]   interpretation and our understanding of the passage, okay?
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.800]   All right.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.400]   And I know it's a big group and stuff, but any questions?
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.400]   Okay.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.400]   Let's move on.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.400]   No, I move.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.720]   All right.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:57.800]   Let's take a look at the first example and the thing that we wanna look at is Proverbs,
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.800]   okay?
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.800]   Proverbs and wisdom, okay?
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:10.600]   Proverbs and wisdom have with it a very interesting element, and I wanna say again that the reason
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.040]   why I'm starting with the book of Proverbs is because there have been a lot of questions.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.800]   How do we interpret it?
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.320]   There have been a lot of misinterpretations and wrong applications as well deriving from
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.320]   those.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:31.080]   Well, if you would, please take your Bible and turn to Proverbs chapter 1, okay?
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:38.640]   Proverbs chapter 1.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:44.560]   And I'm gonna be reading just a small section here starting from Proverbs chapter 1, verse
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.560]   1 through 7.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:52.240]   And he says, "The Proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:58.440]   To know wisdom and instruction, to discern the sayings of understanding, to receive instruction
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:04.520]   in wise behavior, righteousness, justice, and equity, to give prudence to the naive,
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.720]   to the youth, knowledge, and discretion, a wise man will hear an increase in learning
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.060]   and a man of understanding will acquire wise counsel.
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.520]   To understand a proverb and a figure, the words of the wise and their riddles, the fear
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.680]   of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.160]   Fools despise wisdom and instruction."
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.160]   Right?
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:28.960]   I told you at the beginning that oftentimes what you see in terms of content, it's expression,
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.480]   but also it's function.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.820]   Very clearly here, King Solomon is saying, "This is my purpose for writing all these
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.600]   Proverbs together in this book."
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.220]   He wants to make the naive and simple wise up.
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:49.880]   He wants the individual to understand sayings of the wise, of those who have gone before.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.960]   He wants us to understand what is righteousness and what is not righteousness and be able
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.720]   to observe the difference between the two.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.720]   Okay?
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:06.120]   And if you look also in chapter two, okay, in chapter two, he reiterates his purpose.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:11.160]   Verse one, he says, "My son, if you will receive my words and treasure my commandments within
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.200]   you, make your ear attentive to wisdom, incline your heart to understanding.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.000]   For if you cry for discernment, lift your voice for understanding.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.600]   If you seek her as silver and search her as for hidden treasure, then you will discern
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.040]   the fear of the Lord and discover the knowledge of God."
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.960]   Right?
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:38.120]   So here he's talking about your own hunger and desire for wisdom, and then it's the resulting
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.880]   consequence, which is what?
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.880]   Big mansions?
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.160]   Big houses?
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.520]   Big cars?
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.520]   Big bank?
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.520]   No.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.120]   He says what you'll arrive at is this discernment of who is God.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.200]   What you'll arrive at is wisdom.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.200]   Okay?
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:00.880]   And so that's where we want to start off to frame how we want to understand the book of
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.880]   Proverbs.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.440]   So, I want to give a definition.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:15.400]   And first, the book of Proverbs are short wisdom sayings that expresses general truth.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.840]   Okay?
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.960]   What's more?
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:25.040]   These are short wisdom sayings that expresses general reality.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.320]   Okay?
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:31.320]   These are aphorisms that, you know, these pithy statements that state the general reality
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.080]   and state of affairs.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.280]   Okay?
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.280]   You think through the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.680]   What is that?
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:44.040]   When a huge chunk of it's 12 chapters, but the vast majority of it, essentially King
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.920]   Solomon summarizes, he says, "I pursued all the wealth I could possibly have.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.880]   I pursued all the pleasure I could possibly have.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.600]   And I pursued all the knowledge I could possibly have.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.600]   And then I observed vanity."
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.600]   Vanity, vanity, vanity, vanity, vanity.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.600]   Right?
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.600]   What is that?
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.000]   Well, it's wisdom.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.840]   Because truthfully speaking, when I talk to people who've really not, you know, tried
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:16.120]   to live this life to the deceptive, like, promises, but rather live this life aware
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.760]   of all the empty promises that this life has, they will concur.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.560]   Solomon is so wise because all of what he says is quite true.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.360]   They'll see the reality like, "What is this?"
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.360]   Right?
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.840]   And so a lot of the statements, not every single proverb has the same function or the
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:39.480]   same statement, but a lot of these proverbs have a summary of looking at specific circumstances,
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.600]   a summary of the current state of reality.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   Okay?
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:49.400]   And what's more, proverbs I see as general principles of life.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.520]   Okay?
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:55.360]   If you think about it this way, even King Solomon says, "There are these men of wisdom
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:01.360]   who've said wise statements, and they give you general principle of life, and I believe
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.400]   that there is an aspect of art to our Christian living."
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.400]   Okay?
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.000]   Let me say that.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.200]   I believe there is an aspect of art to our Christian living.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.520]   What do I mean by that?
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.800]   It's because there is a level of skill.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.840]   There is a level of wisdom.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.200]   Right?
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.960]   For example, I know that certain animals are incredibly dangerous.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.840]   A venomous snake, right?
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.200]   A venomous snake.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.640]   I could have the knowledge that that snake with one bite could kill me.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.920]   I could have a knowledge of what kind of snake that is.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.400]   I can identify that snake.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:42.420]   But in terms of being able to handle it, what to do with that snake, that's an experience
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:48.480]   and skill that certain trainers, that certain zookeepers will have beyond any other individual
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.480]   at the zoo.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:56.440]   Likewise, there's a certain skill that we learn to handle this life that we have, to
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:03.720]   handle the word of God, to appropriately react to our holy God, to even seek to serve and
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.720]   whatnot.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.120]   There is a skill.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.200]   There is an experience level that is there.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.320]   Well, the book of Proverbs is meant to guide you towards not just simply this is truth
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:19.480]   proposition, but it's guiding you towards skill and wisdom to live a life that is fearful
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.280]   of God abiding in his presence.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.280]   Okay?
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:28.480]   And so as I think about that, I want to again say that the book of Proverbs when you look
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:35.760]   at it is not meant to be taken as like, "Oh, book of Proverbs is teaching me that all X
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.600]   is Y and all Y is Z."
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.080]   Does that make sense?
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.320]   All right.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:49.440]   So now that I've given you just a brief definition of what book of Proverbs in a genre is, we
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.840]   want to, okay, go to the next part.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:59.700]   I want to give you an example of a New Testament proverb, use of a proverb.
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.440]   So let me see if I have, I do.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.040]   This comes from Galatians chapter six, verse six through 10.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.040]   If you want to, you could take a look.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.360]   I actually encourage you, please turn your Bibles there.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:15.280]   I only briefly quote it here so that we can kind of see which proverb that I'm talking
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.680]   about, but you should be looking at the context, right?
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:26.040]   So he says here, "Let the one who is taught," I'm going to give you a little bit of time
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.040]   on that.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:32.040]   He says, "Let the one who is taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:40.400]   Do not be deceived, God is mocked for whatever one sows, that will he also reap."
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.680]   We know that that statement is repeated several times through scripture.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.240]   What you sow, you will reap.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:53.040]   Now if you read this at face value or like right now like this, it's really choppy.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.840]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.560]   So it kind of goes from like, "Hey, he who is taught the word share the good stuff with
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.000]   the one who teaches.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.600]   Don't be deceived, God is not mocked, whatever one sows that he will also reap."
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:12.640]   So here now we have to ask this question like, what is he saying?
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.840]   Is he saying like, "Give your pastor lots of good stuff so that he will invest into
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.340]   you a lot."
[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:19.840]   Is that what he's talking about?
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.480]   No, he's not talking about that.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:28.080]   Essentially when you look at the context of it, he talks about how in the book of Galatians,
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.880]   how we should carry each other's burdens.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:37.480]   How we should care for each other so that we should even care for each other's sins.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.760]   That's the context from which it occurs.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:45.000]   And then he starts to go to this and say, "Hey, do not be deceived, God is not mocked
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.880]   for whatever one sows, that he will also reap."
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.320]   And then the next passage teaches us that we should not sow to the flesh, but we should
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.160]   sow in the spirit.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.600]   So the context is teaching us just a simple truth.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.280]   And I want to encourage us on this level.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:07.280]   There's a principle here that honestly speaking, it's not a hard one.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.800]   It's not a hard parable for her to interpret, right?
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.320]   For what you sow, you will reap.
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.240]   And it's absolutely right.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:19.120]   A lot of us sometimes we wrestle and we complain about circumstances that are fruit of what
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.240]   we've been sowing.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:27.880]   If we have been, I don't know, just distracted, if we have been sowing to the flesh by, I
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.360]   don't know, all the entertainment that we take in.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.360]   I'm not going to name specific stuff, but all the entertainment you take in.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:39.040]   Your investment clearly is like you're investing a lot in just entertaining yourself.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.720]   You've never said no to yourself, but all you've invested in is constantly self-improvement
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.080]   and satisfying whatever you want to.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.840]   And then you complain like, "Oh, how come I'm not there?
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.240]   Like how come I'm not spiritually here?
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.640]   How come I'm not spiritually able to do this?
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.640]   And how come I'm so dry?
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.520]   How come I'm so apathetic?"
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.800]   And then we can just simply state the proverb, "What you sow, you will reap," right?
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:08.240]   And we struggle a lot with the things that have consequences or the fruits of our investment.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:13.160]   But here in this specific passage, he's talking about how we should not sow to our flesh,
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.140]   but we should sow to our spirit.
[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:20.600]   And then he says in verse 10, "Sow then," so he uses that as a specific application.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:25.240]   He says, "As we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, especially those who are
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.240]   in the household of faith."
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:34.840]   So here specifically, he's using the proverb to say, "Sow not to yourself, sow not to your
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:39.600]   own indulgences, but carry the burdens of your brothers and sisters.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.040]   Sow richly into the people around you."
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:47.480]   And there is admonition always for us to be rich towards others.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.520]   We're very, very generous and rich to ourselves.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:53.400]   He says, "No, be rich to the people around you."
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:58.200]   And that's the specific application Apostle Paul has for that proverb.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:06.560]   Now, one of the truths I want to remind us, okay, remind us, is that there are exceptions
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.080]   to proverbs, okay?
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:13.000]   These are, I kept on saying, general truths, general principles.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.520]   They have general principles for life, but there are exceptions.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:29.600]   Remember that in the book of Job, oops, in the book of Job, there's this idea where Eliphaz
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.960]   was bent on this.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:36.600]   He was like, "The innocent people who invest into their spirit and to the people around
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.280]   them, they will always be blessed."
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.880]   And then so he says, "Remember who that was innocent ever perished, or where were the
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.000]   upright cut off?
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.360]   As I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.280]   By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of His anger they are consumed."
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:58.200]   So he essentially says the whole principle of what you sow, what you reap, man.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:01.800]   And so Job is like miserable because he's in pain.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.320]   He's aching and hurting because he lost his children.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:09.280]   He's aching and hurting because his body is beaten down.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:14.440]   And then his friend comes over and says, "Man, what you sow, you reap."
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.080]   And then he realized there are exceptions.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:21.720]   You can sow, sow, sow, sow, and sow, but the fruits are in God's hands.
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.480]   That's another principle for life that we understand.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:29.040]   So we recognize that there are principles in scripture, right?
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:35.000]   General principles in scripture that does not cross apply to every single position in
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   your life.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.880]   So I want to give a warning about that, okay?
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:47.160]   The warning is the proverbial statements are essentially individuals who have great, lengthy,
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:52.600]   long experience summarize into short expression.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:57.600]   But to go backwards, take the short expression and just start to like sticker it on every
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.980]   single situation of your life, it's backwards, right?
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:12.320]   So I want to give the warning that should you read a proverbial life principle statement
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:18.760]   in the scripture and then you say, "But this should be true of my life right now," you're
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.700]   going to be frustrated, right?
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:27.980]   Should you take a proverbial principle statement and then say, "This is the doctrinal truth.
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.720]   Why is God doing this?"
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.660]   You know, then you're going to be frustrated.
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.580]   And that makes sense, right?
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:40.380]   When we universalize or dogmatize certain things that we find in proverbial wisdom statements,
[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:44.100]   then we're going to have a misunderstanding of that genre, okay?
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:50.420]   And so what's more is on a personal level, people sometimes take proverbial statements
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:56.340]   and then because it's personal, they take it as a personal promise to themselves.
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:01.580]   And the warning about proverbial statements in the process of interpretation is do not
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:07.300]   make every proverbial statement a promise specifically to you.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:16.100]   As a matter of fact, when you see promises in scripture, these promises oftentimes speak
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:21.380]   more greatly about the character of God rather than for you to be like, "I was searching
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.380]   for this.
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.380]   Yes, it's for me."
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:27.140]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:31.040]   Especially when you read Old Testament and you hear God promise them like, "I will never
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.580]   forsake you or I'll for sure deliver you."
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.300]   And then you say, "Just give it time.
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.700]   He's going to deliver you."
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:45.140]   I mean, you know instinctively like that has a lot of personal bias behind it rather than
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:48.720]   carefully looking at what is God saying, okay?
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.600]   So here's a couple of examples of this.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:56.960]   And obviously these are kind of more ridiculous ones or like obvious ones.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.960]   Here's an example.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.780]   I think I just left it in your packet there.
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:06.020]   In Proverbs 3 9-10, he says, "Honor the Lord with your wealth and with the first fruits
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.280]   of all your produce.
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:14.820]   Then your barns will be filled with plenty and your vats will be bursting with wine."
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:22.200]   I picked this one because I saw this blasted on the TV and a guy saying, "First give of
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.280]   God, then he'll always multiply to you."
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.940]   And later I'm just going to ask you, just for the sake of practice, okay?
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:34.540]   And for those of you guys who have already prepared yourself, like those of you guys
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:39.640]   who have already come, like you're already always armed to fight prosperity gospel, don't
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.020]   go too crazy now, okay?
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:48.040]   But I'm going to ask you to share in your groups like by specific interpretive process
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:53.800]   and principles, how do you prevent either yourself or somebody else from saying, "Hey,
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:28:00.000]   this is a promise for us because that passage, I mean the context, I mean in terms of other
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:07.400]   references, in terms of, I mean even the wording and stuff could be, could be legitimate."
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.760]   What are you going to say to that, okay?
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:15.980]   So here's another one, Proverbs 22, verse 6, this idea of train up a child in the way
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.800]   he should go.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.660]   Even when he is old, he will not depart from it, okay?
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:26.180]   And the reason why I'm bringing these up is because earlier I mentioned, I'm going to
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.840]   be 100% honest, right?
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:37.760]   I honestly don't think that it's, you know, like because of crazy far out there teaching
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.120]   of interpretation that a lot of people have wrong interpretation.
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:49.180]   I kind of feel like what I said earlier is that because there is always personal interest,
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:53.600]   because there's always conditional hungers that we have and things that we're looking
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:58.000]   for, there can be misinterpretation of the Bible.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:06.600]   And a lot of times when I see that, you know, maybe parents, of course, when we think about
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:11.840]   the salvation of our children, many, many times when we think about whether the kids
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:16.120]   are saved or not, if I think back to like previous youth group experience and all that
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:20.720]   kind of stuff and parents are unwilling to see like my child is potentially not saved
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:26.040]   or is questionable, but they're always just like, "No, they're Christian," you know?
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:29.640]   I kind of think like, man, there's so much personal investment in that.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.600]   I get it, it's your child, you know?
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.200]   But even then, when you look at passages like this, this is not a promise that when you
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:41.500]   do X, Y, and Z for your kid, for sure he's going to be saved.
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.820]   And this is not a promise that when you do Y and Z for your child, for sure he's always
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:46.820]   going to be reigned in.
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:53.740]   I mean, truthfully speaking, God Himself says in Isaiah that He was the Father and His children
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:54.740]   went what?
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.240]   Astray.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.120]   This is not a guarantee.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:04.120]   But again, we talked about general statements of reality, general principles living.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.320]   How should we be wise in our parenting?
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.480]   But these aren't guarantees and promises for us personally.
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.480]   Does that make sense?
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.480]   Okay.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:19.960]   So my exhortation and challenge for us simply was for every passage, look at the specific
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.880]   use of proverbial and principle statements, okay?
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.400]   We're going to do one more exercise pertaining to this.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.280]   But before I go on, any questions?
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.480]   Okay.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.480]   I just throw it out there, you know?
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.600]   Alright.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:41.040]   Take an example in Titus chapter 1, verse 15.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.880]   Please take your Bibles and turn there.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.000]   Oops.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   Okay.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.280]   Please take your Bibles and turn there.
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:54.080]   I'm going to just for the sake of the example, read verse 13 through 16.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:59.160]   And it says here, yeah?
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:04.720]   Just to give you guys context, Apostle Paul has taught Titus that there has to be qualifications
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.280]   for leaders.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.660]   Why?
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:11.860]   Because they have to be able to teach and also to correct.
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:17.720]   And then he gives this exhortation and forewarning, there's going to be false teachers who are
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:23.640]   incredibly hurtful and incredibly strong, so to speak.
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.200]   And it's kind of summary form, they're going to come off super strong.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:31.520]   So the elders and the teachers need to be strong themselves, that there has to be qualifications.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:36.680]   And within this, in the description of those who are the false teachers, he says this,
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.480]   verse 13 through 16.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.480]   This testimony is true.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:45.960]   Therefore rebuke them sharply that they may be sound in faith, not devoting themselves
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:50.400]   to Jewish myths and commandments of people who turn away from the truth.
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:56.200]   And he gives a principle, or like, not a principle, but a maxim, like a general saying.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.160]   To the pure, all things are pure.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.840]   But to the defile and unbelieving, nothing is pure.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.880]   But both their minds and their consciences are defiled.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.560]   They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:14.960]   They are detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good work.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.960]   Let's just do a quick exercise, okay?
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:24.040]   There have actually been many ways I've personally heard this statement be used.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:29.400]   To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.960]   I want you guys first to try and be creative, okay?
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:38.000]   So be bad Bible students and be a little creative, okay?
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.900]   How could this be used?
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.840]   To the pure, all things are pure.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:46.840]   To the defiled, all things are defiled.
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.840]   Yes.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.840]   Excellent.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:59.840]   Oops, sorry, that's not the right one.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.360]   I'm just gonna put these up.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:04.640]   Don't judge me, my heart's pure, okay?
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:11.000]   The whole idea is, hey, to me, everything is pure.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.960]   So the idea, focus on the to the pure, all things are pure, is kind of like to me, everything
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.400]   is pure.
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:22.240]   And then to the defiled, if you're defiled, then everything is defiled, right?
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.880]   And then, I should have just not put this up.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.120]   What other ways can you think of?
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:35.000]   Well, I'm just gonna give that one, is the, I remember somebody, I quote this, we were
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.640]   in a team meeting, and then somebody was complaining, and he was like, man, to the defiled, everything
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.640]   is defiled.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.400]   So he was like, if you're a complainer, everything is gonna look bad to you, right?
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:50.240]   So they just use this as kind of saying, like, there is a subjective sense in which, depending
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:54.240]   on who, the focus is on depending on what you are and who you are and how you perceive
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:58.480]   things, everything is gonna not be sufficient, okay?
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.160]   So how does it, what's your perspective?
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.600]   Is everything pure, or is everything defiled?
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.600]   That's the way.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:10.440]   That's another way.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:17.320]   Any other creative uses of, to the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and unbelieving,
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:20.320]   nothing is pure.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:24.680]   Any thoughts?
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.920]   Okay.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:35.600]   Well, I just wanted to do that exercise to think about that a little bit, because again,
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:43.600]   with Apostle Paul using a proverbial statement to just your regular reading of it, it sounds
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.600]   pretty choppy.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.340]   It really does.
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:50.640]   But once you realize what he's saying, you realize, wow, he's using that as a poignant
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:54.000]   attack on those who are false teachers.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.280]   You look at it in context, and the false teachers are the Jews, right?
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.720]   He talks about how they're devoting themselves to Jewish myths.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:07.640]   In previous section in the passage, he talks about those who are false teachers, especially
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.360]   the ones of the circumcision, right?
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.240]   Especially the ones of the circumcision.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:17.360]   So in this passage, when you look at that, you wanna focus on who he's talking about
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.040]   when he uses this proverb.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.800]   So you ask the difference, not so much on like, oh, what could this possibly relate
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.960]   to, but who he's specifically talking about.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:32.520]   There is a clear contrast between those who are pure and then those who are defiled.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:38.040]   And when you look at the terminology specifically, that term pure has a ceremonial aspect to
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.040]   it.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:43.280]   What is acceptable ceremonially to God, right?
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:46.520]   Versus what is defiled ceremony before God.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:53.520]   And so the huge contrast should be in thinking about those whom God deems to be acceptable
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.080]   versus those who God deems to be defiled.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:02.200]   And so, you know, when we think about this, I'm gonna give a specific passage for you.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:06.320]   Jesus speaks to it almost precisely in Matthew 15.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:10.000]   For the sake of time, I'm just gonna give you the summary version of that.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.800]   The Pharisees come to Jesus complaining, what is wrong and what is up with your disciples?
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.620]   Why are they eating with their hands without washing it thoroughly?
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:23.840]   Why aren't they doing the ceremonial act of cleansing themselves?
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:28.520]   30 people, and then Jesus gets very frustrated.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.720]   What do you care?
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.320]   What do you care about ceremonial cleanliness?
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:38.680]   When you lie about what's being devoted to your parents and then you elevate the ceremonies
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:42.080]   of man, but you neglect everything about what's acceptable to God.
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:46.320]   And then he talks about the heart and he says, what goes into a man by your hand does not
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:52.680]   make you defiled, but everything about your heart produces everything that's defiled.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.720]   All the adultery, the thievery, and falsehood.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.400]   And that's exactly what he's talking about here.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:03.240]   That when the heart is pure, then what is coming out is pure.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:09.440]   But when you are defiled, everything that is coming out is unacceptable to the Lord.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:12.040]   It's all defiled, right?
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:17.040]   So again, proverbial statement that's used very specifically to attack the false teachers.
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:21.920]   And he's essentially, you know, reminiscent and quoting almost the same thing what Jesus
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.240]   is talking about, okay?
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:29.880]   Alright, so with that being said, with all the proverbial statements, I just want to
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.880]   give a warning.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:35.440]   Someone could be like, well, you know, is that just talking about the heart then and
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.240]   what about the actions, don't they matter?
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.760]   And it's like, of course they do.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:45.960]   Remember, proverbial statements does not have an addressing of every possible what ifs.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:53.400]   Apostle Paul is using a general summary statement to talk about a specific application, okay?
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.400]   Any questions?
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:38:03.200]   Alright, then let's move forward to our second genre that we want to talk about tonight,
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.800]   which is biblical narratives.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.400]   Alright, biblical narratives.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:13.480]   Please turn your Bible over to Luke chapter 1, verse 1 through 4.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:19.840]   Luke chapter 1, verse 1 through 4.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:26.920]   And I really appreciate it when essentially at the forefront of the book, the book itself
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:31.560]   tells you what is the intended purpose, okay?
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:39.160]   And it basically says here, "Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile an account of the
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:43.640]   things accomplished among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:48.520]   beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the world, it seemed fitting for me as well,
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:52.600]   having investigated everything carefully from the beginning, to write it out for you in
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:58.120]   a consecutive order, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the exact truth about
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.400]   the things you have been taught."
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.400]   Okay?
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.200]   I'm going to read you another one.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.680]   You don't have to turn there for the sake of time.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.040]   It comes from John chapter 20, verse 31.
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:12.800]   "These things are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:17.800]   of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name."
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.800]   Okay?
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:25.080]   Remember how I talked about genre has elements of function, intent, and purpose.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:31.520]   And the gospel writers has given us very explicit statements about its purpose and intent.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.520]   Okay?
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:39.400]   Now, to give you a definition of biblical narratives, I want to say these three statements,
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.400]   okay?
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:47.360]   For your blanks, it is that biblical narratives are historical redemptive stories.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.520]   Okay?
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:55.480]   Biblical narratives are historical redemptive stories.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:40:01.640]   And those three key terms I'm going to use as headings to talk about how we should and
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:05.120]   should not interpret biblical narratives.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.520]   Okay?
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:11.320]   First, we should definitely read the Old Testament and all the narrative portions of the New
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.640]   Testament as historical accounts.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.760]   Okay?
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.920]   As historical accounts.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:25.040]   Meaning simply just that you should read them as real accounts of history in factual terms.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.080]   Okay?
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.640]   In factual terms.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:35.160]   So in biblical narratives, it is absolutely okay for you to ask, "Wow, what was that historical
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.320]   event like?"
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.240]   So it's actually okay for you to read up history books.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:45.120]   Actually, it is not just okay, but imperative that you look up their historical context,
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:51.760]   that you go back so that you drop down into their situation.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.680]   What was the scenery like?
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:59.560]   If you're reading the story, an account of, you know, in our BCC class, I say this all
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.240]   the time.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.920]   Everything surrounding Christ, there is so much historical evidence that if you were
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:10.040]   an actual historian, it would be unprofessional of you.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.040]   Right?
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:16.120]   It would be so biased of you to deny the existence of Christ because so much history describes
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.680]   the events of that time.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:23.000]   Well we have then the obligation to go back and think about what was their context?
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.080]   What was their culture?
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.880]   How did they use their terms?
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:26.880]   Right?
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.400]   What was the interaction like between certain people?
[00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:35.680]   If there's any historical details that would paint a better picture for you of that historical
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.680]   event, you must.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.680]   Why?
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.760]   Because they're real events.
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.440]   They're real events.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.800]   And I think that it would be beneficial for us to read it with that kind of faith because
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:53.120]   truthfully speaking, that continues to create for us awe and wonder because all the miracles,
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:57.560]   all of the dealings of God, all the sufferings of the people, all the redemptions of the
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:04.200]   people, all these things are historical actual events that have happened.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.800]   Okay?
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:13.440]   However, however, because there are historical events, we should not be reading them as morally
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.540]   permissible things.
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:19.560]   We don't read the history of the kings of England and then be like, "That's what we
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.560]   should do."
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.560]   Yeah, assassinate my enemy.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:26.800]   Like, what are you going to do with that?
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:31.440]   But a lot of times because we're reading historical narrative, we automatically think like, "Well,
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.040]   it's there in the Bible.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.040]   He did it."
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.240]   That's just like doing one of these like, "Well, MacArthur did it," you know?
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.120]   "Well, he did it."
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.960]   We know we shouldn't be doing that kind of stuff.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:49.240]   Actually I want to say that we know that from biblical narrative, not only is it not necessarily
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:54.040]   good for us to follow everything as examples, but actually most of the characters in the
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.400]   Old Testament are riddled with sin.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.400]   Right?
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:01.760]   And what's really funny, what's super duper funny is that, I'm just going to give you
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.280]   a ridiculous example, okay?
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:07.280]   I don't know if you guys remember the story, so I'm going to give it to you a little bit
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.600]   here in Genesis chapter 30 through 32.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:17.040]   Because he loves, you know, Rachel so much, he is willing to stay super duper long with
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.440]   Laban to work his land.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:22.520]   You know, he works seven years and another seven years and then grand total he's there
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.520]   like 20 years.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:29.120]   During that time, he knows he's going to depart at some point or another, so he makes this
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:35.800]   deal like, "Hey, I've worked so hard and amassed this huge wealth of cattle and possessions
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.800]   and stuff.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.000]   I'm just going to take all the blemished ones."
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Right?
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.160]   And then what essentially happens is, Jacob in his scheming, deceptive ways, he takes
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:50.200]   this certain kind of branch that's spotted and he puts it by the watering hole of the
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.200]   animals.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.760]   And then anytime there was a strong, like muscular lamb, he'd be like, "Here, buddy.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:55.760]   Here, buddy."
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.720]   And they would drink by the branch and then all of a sudden they'd come out all spotted.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.720]   You know?
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.800]   Number one, I remember so many Koreans saying, "See?
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.600]   What you should do is put a nice picture, a very picture of a pretty girl or boy on
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:10.640]   the wall by your house so that every time you leave, you would look at it and then your
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.640]   babies would be beautiful."
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:12.640]   Right?
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.480]   Have you guys ever heard that?
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.480]   Is it just my mom?
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:18.720]   And I'm always like, "Don't worry.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:19.720]   My kids are good looking."
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:20.720]   All right?
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:25.040]   There was some hilarious, ridiculous thing about what you look at, that's what your baby
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.360]   is going to be because from that story.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.680]   And they would always quote that.
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:33.080]   Or somebody would always quote that story about how shrewd you should be, that it's
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.720]   okay to receive the best from what you're working at.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.200]   If you're going to work, then get the best.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.200]   You know?
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.880]   It's like, "Dang, I don't know if..."
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:45.520]   I mean, if you should work, yeah, you should be a worker that's due his wage, but to use
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:50.920]   that passage as a means to be like, "It's okay as long as you come out on top," that's
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:53.040]   kind of shady.
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.040]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:45:02.120]   But the fact of the matter is you cannot use Old Testament stories as permissions or this
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:03.120]   is the way it ought to be.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:08.520]   I'm going to be honest, there are a lot of people who say to the churches, "Hey, this
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.080]   is what happened in the New Testament.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.960]   How come we're not doing that?"
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.280]   Because there was never any instruction that we should do this.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.440]   It's a story.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.480]   It's a story of what's happened.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.560]   Right?
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:26.820]   And so I remember also even in a counseling setting, someone had made a certain promise
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:29.200]   and they're like, "I just got to keep it."
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.560]   And then they quoted the whole like Jephthah story, you know, Judges chapter...
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.360]   I don't have it.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:42.040]   It's like later on, Judges chapter 20 some, and then Jephthah makes this vow like, "Anything
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.400]   that comes out of my house, I'm going to sacrifice."
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.800]   I mean, first and foremost, why would you ever say something like that?
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:51.960]   So I said, "Moral of the story actually is stop making silly vows, man.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:55.560]   Scripture says stop making silly vows because you can't even promise.
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:58.000]   You know, let your yes be yes and your no be no.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.120]   Who are you that you're going to promise things for tomorrow?"
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:05.160]   But then he used that by saying like, "Even though it's like a bad idea, I should just
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.160]   keep it."
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:12.880]   And I said, "Hey, hey, like you can't use Old Testament stories as moralistic, 'This
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.800]   is what I ought to do.'"
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:19.080]   Actually I said, "The New Testament teaches you to be reasonable."
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.920]   Right?
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:24.760]   The New Testament teaches you to be wise and discerning.
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:29.400]   As a matter of fact, the Old Testament doesn't really, that passage, I think it's chapter
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:34.880]   20, now it's bothering me, but that passage never concludes with like, "And thus God
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:35.880]   was pleased."
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:39.720]   Or like, "And thus," you know, it doesn't give you a moral discernment, but rather the
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:43.600]   whole book says, "And see, everybody was wicked.
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.320]   Everybody was just doing whatever they wanted and there was no king and everybody was just
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.040]   lost and blind."
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:53.200]   It doesn't give you a moral summary of whether that was good or bad.
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:57.080]   So stop using Old Testament as, "This is what I should do."
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.840]   And those are some examples of it.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:06.880]   I want to say that, again, the Old Testament narrative, first and foremost, is history
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.280]   of, "This is what happened."
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:11.800]   Not necessarily, "This is what should have happened."
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.800]   Does that make sense?
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.680]   Old Testament narrative, "This is what happened," and not necessarily, "This is what should
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:18.680]   have happened."
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:19.680]   Okay?
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:24.960]   Secondly, I said that the Old Testament narrative is redemptive.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.960]   Okay?
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.120]   Redemptive.
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:35.040]   And all we're saying is, there is a theme and purpose to the story, just like we read
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.240]   in the Gospel of John.
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:42.200]   So the books are not dictionaries or glossaries of all the doctrines.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:46.860]   As a matter of fact, it's not even a doctrine teaching book.
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:48.780]   It is not a catechism.
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:50.480]   It is first redemptive.
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:57.320]   So I'm going to say this, that all narratives are by nature selective for redemptive history.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.600]   Okay?
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:02.560]   All narratives are by nature selective for redemptive history.
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:06.240]   Now when I say this, I'm going to say it cautiously.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:14.400]   The Old Testament narrative is not, sorry, is incomplete in a sense.
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.480]   I said that carefully.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:17.840]   The Old Testament is incomplete in a sense.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.220]   What do I mean by that?
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:22.060]   That it is not erroneously incomplete.
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.740]   It is not exhaustive.
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:27.420]   It does not write for you, "Oh, but what happened with those people?
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:28.820]   Oh, what happened with that guy?
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:31.660]   How come it just drops that character at this point?"
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:36.660]   Because insofar as it is important for the redemptive history, it is there.
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:42.300]   Insofar as it contributes to your faith and understanding of God, your need for redemption,
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:43.980]   and et cetera, it is there.
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:48.040]   But it is not an exhaustive story of the events of history.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:52.660]   As a matter of fact, if you think about why it's so confusing sometimes to read the Old
[00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:58.180]   Testament, because you read 1 Kings and 2 Kings and 1 Chronicles and 2 Chronicles, honestly,
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:01.460]   how many of you guys got really confused?
[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:02.460]   I did.
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:05.220]   The first time I went through that, I was like, "So what?"
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:08.500]   And then so you're like, "Okay, I'm going to need to diagram who these kings are."
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:11.500]   And then you're halfway through, you're like, "No, that's not okay."
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:15.700]   And you start diagramming and you realize, "Hey, this story repeats itself through the
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:16.700]   Chronicles."
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:22.580]   But it's emphasizing two very different aspects of redemptive history.
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:30.460]   So what I'm going to say is a lot of the historical narrative has this purpose for your faith,
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:32.060]   for your faith.
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:34.100]   And what I'm going to say as an example is this.
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:40.940]   Take for example the stories in the Gospels of all the miracles that are written there.
[00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:41.940]   Okay?
[00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:44.140]   All the miracles that are written there.
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:50.660]   The purpose for you, I hope, is not like, "So are we supposed to be charismatic or are
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:53.020]   we not supposed to be charismatic?"
[00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:58.020]   Like sure, that's a legitimate question that can be answered, but the purpose for you reading
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:03.260]   that Jesus Christ miraculously fed the 5,000 people, that Jesus Christ spoke a word and
[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:08.940]   the man came out from the tomb, that's supposed to be awe-inspiring for you so that you'd
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:13.620]   be taking a back and say, "Who is this man?"
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:19.580]   And then you realize this is the Son of God that has authority over substance and material.
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:23.500]   This is the Son of God that has authority over death.
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:28.660]   That's the effect of a story that it should have on you.
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:34.380]   And Scripture says it, that when you put it into context that even in the stories, let's
[00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:40.300]   say John chapter 6 verse 1 through 15, if you read it, if you read it, it gives you
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:45.380]   the hint of meaning that after all these people experienced a great many of miracles, if you
[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:49.740]   read in verse 30 through 31, it talks about how these great miracles contributed to the
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:57.900]   idea that Jesus was the promised Messiah and that people were filled, the people were filled
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:59.580]   with wonder.
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:01.940]   Right?
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:08.500]   And so the idea here is that the redemptive nature of the narrative is more important
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:13.180]   for you to think about than just simply answering your doctrinal questions.
[00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:14.460]   Okay?
[00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:19.740]   So next, the idea is it is still a story.
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:20.740]   Okay?
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:21.740]   It is still a story.
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:25.140]   And I want to encourage you.
[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:31.020]   You should appreciate the biblical narratives as literary masterpieces.
[00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:32.660]   Okay?
[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:39.260]   If you, if any of you are like literature and like English majors or whatnot, and you
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:46.100]   take certain works of, you know, works of literature and you appreciate them for how
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:52.540]   they moved you through the journey, I bet you you would be all the more just engrossed
[00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:55.340]   in the scriptures if you read it the same way.
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:56.940]   What do I mean by that?
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:01.220]   A lot of people that I know read the Old Testament in chunks.
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:05.580]   I read three chapters a day because I'm on the year of the Bible reading plan.
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:06.660]   Right?
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:11.780]   But whoever reads their literature books like that, you know what I'm saying?
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:13.540]   Like again, we have different genres.
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:16.940]   We have works of fictional novels.
[00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:19.860]   We have works of documentary for history.
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:23.140]   We've got IKEA instructional manual.
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.380]   You don't read all those things the same way.
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:27.860]   The manual you read a couple of verses and you do it.
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:30.220]   You read a couple of verses and you do it.
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:31.220]   Right?
[00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:34.780]   The works of art and literature, you don't sit there and chop up into three chapters
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:36.500]   every day.
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:42.580]   So I'm encouraging all of you, read the narratives and movements so that you would appreciate
[00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:45.580]   plot, movement, character development.
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:50.860]   You know, there's always in literature crisis and conflict.
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:53.940]   Then there's desperation and drama, the pinnacle of it.
[00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:57.860]   And there's also resolution and hope for the future and all that kind of stuff.
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:00.220]   And the Bible is chock full of it.
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.580]   Chock full of it.
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:07.020]   And sometimes you won't appreciate that if again, if you're reading the Bible in chunks
[00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:08.020]   a lot.
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:09.020]   Okay?
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:12.860]   I want to encourage you guys again, look at it that way.
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:16.260]   Even the Old Testament narratives, even the New Testament narratives, there should be
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:19.540]   a buildup in that way.
[00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:20.940]   Okay?
[00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:24.740]   So, first is appreciate it as a literary masterpiece.
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:25.740]   Okay.
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:28.740]   First, appreciate it as a literary masterpiece.
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:39.740]   And secondly, when you should not do this, you should not look to it as direct documentation.
[00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:46.740]   The scriptures teaches us doctrines in the Old Testament, but a lot of times it is indirect.
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:47.740]   It's indirect.
[00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:53.740]   It rather illustrates the doctrines that are important to us.
[00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:58.740]   And then those doctrines are directly taught us in other parts of the world.
[00:53:58.740 --> 00:53:59.740]   Okay?
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:05.740]   So, even when we think about the holiness of God, you notice that when we started talking
[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:12.740]   about the holiness of God, we talked about events in history where a man dared to audaciously
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:14.740]   just go and touch stuff.
[00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:18.740]   To audaciously just go and talk to God and enter into his presence.
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:21.740]   And then we said, "Look what happened."
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:23.740]   And it's illustrated in the holiness.
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:29.740]   We talked about the book of Leviticus and all along, it illustrated how we needed its holiness.
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:35.740]   So, ask those questions of what is the narrative that emphasizes whether by direct quotation,
[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:40.740]   right, whether by direct speaking from God, or by the illustration that the prophet is
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:42.740]   giving, or whatever it may be.
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:47.740]   But the thing about it is the danger for us when we look to the Old Testament for just
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:52.740]   straight doctrines is that again, we're going to take something as a piece from history,
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:57.740]   and then we're going to extrapolate it from the prophets and say, "I don't know.
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:00.740]   This applies to our circumstance now."
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:03.740]   That is incredibly dangerous for us.
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:09.740]   Now, a way of kind of wrapping things up, a way of kind of giving a last exhortation.
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:14.740]   Truthfully speaking, again, this is a lot of review for you guys.
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:20.740]   Some of you intuitively know, trying to teach biblical hermeneutics is kind of tough.
[00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:27.740]   My exhortation to you as we've been exhorting you all throughout this series is practice
[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:31.740]   the hermeneutics as you continue to study the Bible.
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:38.740]   You will realize if the passage dictates that you be allegorical, then you shouldn't.
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:43.740]   You shouldn't just take a preconceived notion like the Bible and narrative is allegorical,
[00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:44.740]   so let's do it.
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:47.740]   If the passage has allegory in it, then do it.
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:52.740]   If the passage is didactic, teaching you doctrine, then do it.
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:58.740]   If the passage is meant to give you beauty and it's more romantic, then do it.
[00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:00.740]   You know what I mean?
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:06.740]   Then the practice of you observing and recognizing the genre and applying the principles of hermeneutics
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:09.740]   continue to develop and so will you.
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:10.740]   Okay?
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:13.740]   Let's take a moment to pray, and then I'll wrap up.
[00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:17.320]   >> [INAUDIBLE]
