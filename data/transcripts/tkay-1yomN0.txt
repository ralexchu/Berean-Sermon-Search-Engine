[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.920]   Please welcome Tandis.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.640]   Hi, everyone.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.560]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.800]   So what I want to talk about today
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.680]   is the problem that I'm obsessed with, which is bad customer
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.400]   service in health care.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.680]   So I'd like to start out by walking you
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.840]   through a day at the doctor's office.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.040]   It can look a little bit like this.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.960]   You have to start out by making an appointment.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.160]   So you call in.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.920]   You talk to someone very unpleasant on the phone.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.880]   They put you on hold.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.380]   You wait.
[00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.560]   There's bad hold music.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.120]   You're waiting.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.900]   You're waiting.
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.240]   They come back.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.840]   You go back and forth a little bit on your calendars.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.800]   You get an appointment.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.480]   It's in 21 days.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.840]   Now it's 21 days later.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.400]   You go to the doctor's office.
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.740]   Someone very unpleasant checks you in at the front desk.
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.840]   You sit down.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.400]   Super depressing waiting room, bad wall art,
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.600]   very old issues of Parenting Magazine,
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.440]   smells like Purell in there.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.040]   That's fine.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.800]   This is your hangout for a little bit now.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.360]   And now it's maybe 30 or 40 minutes later.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.640]   Someone calls you back.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.980]   As you may have guessed, they're very unpleasant.
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.280]   They take you back to the exam room.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.560]   It's very small, blad fluorescent lighting
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.360]   everywhere.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.280]   They take your vitals.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.480]   They hand you, essentially, a sheet of printer paper.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.360]   They tell you to change into this.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.200]   Now you're in sort of a secondary holding chamber,
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.840]   except this time you can hear the doctor in the other room.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.920]   And they're saying, hey, it's so great to see you.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.360]   And so you know they're just getting started in there,
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.800]   even though your appointment was an hour ago at this point.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.560]   Pull up your phone.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.080]   You start to go through your little question list.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.800]   Get up the courage to ask everything you came in to ask.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.840]   And then finally, the doctor knocks,
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.560]   like you could possibly still be changing.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.640]   He comes in, does a little small talk with you.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.320]   He goes and sits down, starts asking you some questions.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.400]   You're maybe like eight minutes into the appointment
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.960]   at this point.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.760]   And you're like, OK, also I have some questions.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.120]   And you pull up your little question list on your phone.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.760]   And you get through maybe like two or three of these questions.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.960]   And then the doctor starts to give you a look like,
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.920]   let's wrap this up.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.880]   And so you wrap it up.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.080]   You ask three questions.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.280]   The appointment is over.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.400]   You go outside.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.240]   You check out.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.400]   If you're lucky, they'll tell you how much you owe.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.840]   If not, you will just find out later in the mail.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.160]   So my guess is that maybe many of you in this audience
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.520]   have a concierge doctor.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.600]   But most of us have had some iteration of this experience
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.660]   at some point.
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.080]   There are a lot of terrible things about our health care
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.460]   system, but the one I want to complain about specifically
[00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.360]   today is why the customer service at the point at which
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.560]   you're actually consuming the health care
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.600]   is so appallingly bad.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.200]   And when I refer to customer service,
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.520]   that's anything that touches the patient experience
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.360]   while you're going to the doctor.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.840]   So a long wait time is as much bad customer service
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.400]   as the unfriendly front desk person.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.000]   There's this really great quote that I
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.080]   love from Bill Gurley, prolific investor.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.920]   And my relationship hall passed.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.760]   Didn't know he was going to be here.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.480]   The US health care market is the least customer
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.720]   centric of any customer service industry.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.640]   We are so numb to the pain that we rarely object or complain.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.040]   So that's part of what I think is so crazy about this,
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.520]   is that we kind of just take it.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.080]   And so that got me curious to explore three questions
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.360]   that I want to go through with you here today.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.200]   Number one, why are things so bad?
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.740]   How did they get this way?
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.600]   Number two, why should we care that things are so bad?
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.560]   And number three, what can we do about it?
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.840]   What's a little something we can do to make it better?
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.200]   So let's start with, why are things so bad?
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.440]   A big part of this is our customer service problem
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.560]   is really more of a consumer service problem.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.400]   And what I mean by that is patients
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.480]   are consuming the health care, but they're not exactly
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.520]   the customer in the traditional free market sense of the term.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.680]   So who is?
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.640]   The US health care system, as we know,
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.880]   is an employer sponsored model.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.360]   This was not very well thought out.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.960]   It's more of a World War II relic
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.280]   that came from a national mandated wage freeze in 1942.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.920]   And we kind of just kept going with it.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.040]   And now today, the doctor is not getting out
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.200]   of bed in the morning for your $15 co-pay.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.700]   They're really making their money off
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.760]   of the major stakeholders in the industry who
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.000]   are the employers and the insurance companies.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.800]   They're the payers.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.520]   They're the real customers in this story.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.440]   And doctors don't love this either, by the way.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.620]   There's major burnout in the medical community.
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.280]   But when you play this all the way out,
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.980]   you're left with misaligned incentives
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.280]   between physicians and patients.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.680]   Physicians in the traditional fee-for-service model,
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.260]   which is our predominant model today,
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.480]   where physicians are paid per patient encounter,
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.680]   they're incentivized by volume and not by quality
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.080]   and not by good health outcomes.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.000]   So it's no surprise that practices are not designed
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.680]   to cater to the patient.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.960]   And once that becomes the norm, it becomes the culture.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.760]   Every doctor's office can get away with it.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.200]   And now you're left with these two really bad stats.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.420]   The first one is, in primary care specifically,
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.460]   the average NPS for a provider is three.
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.260]   That is so embarrassing.
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.740]   Number two, 96% of patient complaints
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.220]   are about the service itself.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.420]   Only 4% are about the care delivered.
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.700]   So patients are really noticing how bad the customer service is.
[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.100]   And yet, to go back to our earlier point,
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.940]   patients have this sort of Stockholm syndrome
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.980]   when it comes to going to the doctor specifically.
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.820]   We'll request a non-talkative Uber
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.980]   because we don't feel like chatting with the driver,
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.620]   or we'll leave a very scathing Yelp review for a restaurant.
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.220]   But when it comes to this service,
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.340]   even though we're not an easy to please generation,
[00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.940]   we become very submissive.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.420]   And it's the most important service
[00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.340]   across any service industry.
[00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.540]   So this is not a good thing.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.580]   Why is this happening?
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.180]   And why should we care that we're
[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.240]   having such a bad time at the doctor's office?
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.260]   It's because bad service is bad for our health.
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.500]   So good medicine is a partnership
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.940]   between a patient who's coming in with real information
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.140]   on how they're feeling and then a physician who's
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.820]   coming in with real expertise to bring to that information.
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.820]   And they work together.
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.620]   But if the patient is feeling very anxious and exhausted
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.220]   and the doctor is feeling very rushed and dismissive,
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.540]   you're left with losing a bunch of really important information
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.820]   that you need to make nuanced diagnostic and treatment
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.940]   plans.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.620]   So to give you an example, doctors
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.900]   are far more likely to prescribe antibiotics in the afternoon
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.180]   than they are in the morning for the same patient
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.620]   with the same issues because they're just running late
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.460]   and they're dealing with decision fatigue.
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.220]   If you leave with anything from this talk,
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.220]   it should be to make morning appointments.
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.100]   And then patients, on the other hand, know all of this.
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.340]   And they've felt this before.
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.940]   And so what many of them end up doing
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.860]   is deferring treatment altogether.
[00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.460]   So patients feel like it's a hassle.
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.060]   They're not getting anything out of it.
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.920]   They will just text their med school friend.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.660]   Health care has a patient buy-in problem
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.500]   because they've made the experience of going
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.320]   to the doctor's office so bad that we only
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.220]   go when we absolutely have to go.
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.740]   And what do we lose when we go when we only absolutely
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:10.860]   have to go?
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.540]   Preventive care.
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.620]   And preventive care is really the reason
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.920]   it's so bad that we're not going to the doctor's office.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.620]   We lose out on going when things are early.
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.960]   We lose out on all the upstream, life-saving, cost-saving
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.260]   benefits of prevention.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.620]   So I'm going to hit you with three stats on that.
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.940]   The first one is 40% of annual deaths
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.500]   caused by the top five causes of death in the US
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.260]   are preventable with good preventive care.
[00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.560]   According to the CDC, for whatever that's worth to you,
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.540]   avoidable chronic disease accounts
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.300]   for 75% of our health care spend.
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.260]   And finally, on the other hand, patients
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.260]   with a PCP, a primary care doctor,
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.300]   spend 33% less on health care overall
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.620]   because they're front-loading that spend toward prevention.
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.060]   So bad service is bad for our health.
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.380]   What can we do about it?
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.260]   The good news is this.
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.420]   We are starting to see more and more practices
[00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.020]   shift towards models that incentivize physicians to care
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.460]   about good customer service.
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.380]   So there are two models we can use here
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.660]   to change the compensation model to allow physicians
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.660]   to have time and space to think about service.
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.180]   So the first one is direct-to-consumer.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.860]   So that's making the patient the customer again
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.500]   in this scenario.
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.780]   And the second one is leveraging value-based care models,
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:29.780]   where the insurers are reimbursing based on quality
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.020]   instead of over volume.
[00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.380]   And so in that case, the insurer is still the customer,
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.180]   but we're now rewarding a different outcome here.
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.820]   So those are the two options that we can leverage.
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.060]   But as we can see, we have the tools that we need.
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.940]   It's really now about shifting norms in the health care
[00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.460]   industry.
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.340]   And the industry is very clunky, and it's red tapey,
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.220]   and it's sort of crotchety at times.
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.180]   And so the change might feel a little bit slower
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.700]   than it does in other industries.
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.580]   But we're starting to see more and more companies push back.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.020]   And as they push back, patient expectations change.
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.260]   We start to expect more out of our health care.
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.380]   And now we're starting to treat health care the way
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.460]   we treat any other service that we interact with.
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.020]   And we start to say goodbye to that Stockholm syndrome era.
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.980]   But as we move towards these models that
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.560]   change the incentives for physicians,
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.460]   we still need a framework to think about, OK,
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.180]   how do we get that good customer service?
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.940]   How do we actually get the patient buy-in?
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.660]   How do we get people to want to go back to the doctor's office?
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.540]   Because doctors and hospital administrators
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.060]   are not used to thinking about this.
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.660]   They're not used to training on customer service or bedside
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.580]   manner.
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.380]   So we need to look to another industry, which
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.460]   is the hospitality industry.
[00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.260]   So I brought you on this journey here today to tell you,
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.780]   we need to be stealing from the hospitality industry.
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.340]   They have figured this out already.
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.180]   They know how to treat people like people.
[00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.180]   They know how to provide human-to-human service,
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.660]   which is ultimately today what health care still is.
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.260]   So I really think this definition of hospitality
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.900]   from Danny Meyer is really great.
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.580]   Esteemed restaurateur, my other relationship hall pass.
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.500]   Hospitality is present when something happens for you.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.100]   It is absent when something happens to you.
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.820]   So we want health care that happens for patients and not
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.140]   to patients, really Michelin-worthy,
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.100]   or at least very effusive Yelp review-worthy health care.
[00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.740]   And I want to share a few ideas on how
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.940]   I think we can get there.
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.300]   I'm the co-founder of a primary care membership
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.340]   service called the Landby.
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.660]   And we do what we call a health care hospitality
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.420]   training with all of our team members, all of our providers.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.220]   And I want to share a few central tenets
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.900]   from that training with you that I
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.940]   think are the ones that can be applied into any practice.
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.500]   They can be implemented at very low cost
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.660]   and can really start to shift the norms
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.820]   and shift the culture, which is what we need.
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.180]   Some of these may seem obvious, but they're not in health care.
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.100]   So here we go.
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.300]   These are my top five.
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.500]   Number one, follow the golden rule.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.380]   Patients are entrusting us with their most precious resource,
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.420]   which is their health.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.820]   Treat them the way you would want
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.320]   to be treated at the doctor or you'd
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.860]   want your family to be treated.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.700]   Number two, set clear expectations.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.020]   This is not a subway track.
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.900]   Nobody wins when we hold information
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.940]   like running a few minutes late to ourselves.
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.100]   Number three, be a good, active, empathetic listener.
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.900]   Ask good questions to get good clues.
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.280]   Treat every case like it's a medical investigation.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.320]   If someone didn't think something was important,
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.740]   they wouldn't have brought it up with us.
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.580]   Another Danny Meyer line, be an agent, not a gatekeeper.
[00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.380]   So an agent lets people in.
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.660]   A gatekeeper builds up barriers to keep people out.
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.620]   We don't want to be that kind of practice.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.860]   If a patient has a good reason to be asking
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.940]   you to break one of our rules and there's
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.220]   an easy way to break it within the bounds of the law,
[00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.220]   then just break it.
[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.300]   Finally, for extra credit, surprise and delight.
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.220]   How can we make this the best interaction of a patient's day
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.620]   even if they're going through something really challenging?
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.180]   I think that's the fun puzzle of applying hospitality
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.060]   into the health care context is finding a way
[00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:54.900]   to bridge that gap.
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.900]   How can we remember something about someone
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.780]   and make them feel seen and make them feel like, yeah,
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:03.660]   I want to come back to the doctor's office?
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.780]   All right, I don't have a super punchy ending here,
[00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:09.380]   so I'm just going to wrap this up with health care
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.780]   hospitality treats patients the way
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.300]   they deserve to be treated.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.040]   We're all patients at some point.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.640]   And when that point comes, the stakes
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.000]   will feel inherently high, too high
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.340]   to get worse service than you would
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.500]   at your favorite restaurant.
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.000]   Thank you.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.460]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:32.300]   I think the thing that struck me about our dysfunctional system
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.260]   is the Bill Gurley quote and then what you're doing.
[00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.100]   There is no customer.
[00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.660]   And how does that change over time in America?
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:44.500]   I know what you're doing with your company is part of it.
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.660]   So how do we change that in Americans' perception?
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.820]   Because I got my knee done, and I
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.100]   didn't know how much it cost.
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.500]   And then I found out just cleaning out my meniscus
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.460]   was $60,000, and that was like--
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:56.340]   How much?
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.660]   $60,000 10 years ago for a meniscus surgery in New York.
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.060]   And then somebody said, that should cost like $10,000.
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.460]   And there's no menu.
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.180]   So we're going to a restaurant.
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.180]   You know when you go to the restaurant in Italy,
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.460]   like the ones you go to, and there's no--
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.180]   Prices?
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.140]   Yeah.
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.640]   That's when you know you're fucked.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.500]   I love those.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.060]   Yeah, you love it.
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.660]   Then you hand me the check.
[00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.460]   We were in Vegas that time.
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:25.500]   So how do Americans start changing
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.220]   how they perceive this?
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.060]   I think that's part of the problem, is it not?
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.380]   Definitely part of the problem is that we all are kind of just
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.720]   OK with it and assume that this is this industry where we're
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.760]   not supposed to know the prices until afterwards.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.540]   No other industry works this way.
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.980]   We don't put up with it anywhere else.
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.660]   And so I think direct-to-consumer models
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.300]   play a huge role in getting patients to think,
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.040]   oh, I can treat this like other services.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.420]   It's not like we're not annoying consumers in other ways.
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.060]   We already are.
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.060]   And so we just need to apply that same annoying attitude
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.820]   to health care.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.460]   And then by leveraging direct-to-consumer models,
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.820]   part of this is getting on higher deductible plans.
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.460]   So we start to treat our dollars more like normal dollars,
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.340]   putting money into HSAs and FSAs.
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.860]   It gets us to start thinking more
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.980]   like a traditional customer and think about where
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.020]   we're spending our money.
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.740]   We see that a little bit with direct-to-consumer drug
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.300]   companies, HIMSS, HERRS, GetRome,
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.740]   and all the stuff that Freeberg uses to get ready for battle.
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:21.740]   David, nice to meet you.
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:22.240]   Yeah, hey.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:22.740]   How are you?
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.240]   Good.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.140]   Your hair looks great.
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.460]   To prepare for war.
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:30.540]   Those are a start, right?
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.020]   People are now--
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:31.020]   Take care.
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.220]   I'm just saying nice things from now on.
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:32.720]   Come on.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.820]   I love it.
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.980]   But this is part of it that people are saying,
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.860]   it's so dysfunctional to go to the doctor.
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.180]   It's so dysfunctional to deal with my insurance company.
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.500]   For certain things, I'm just going
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.820]   to go on a website and order.
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:45.580]   Yep.
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.460]   That is part of the frustration, right?
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:47.900]   Yeah.
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:48.180]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.460]   That gives you a little taste of it.
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.580]   And then, alternatively, if you don't want to go to the doctor,
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.000]   you'll go to Urgent Care, which has
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.020]   much more of an easy pricing menu in many cases
[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:55.900]   that you can look at.
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.900]   So again, we're starting to get a taste of it.
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.780]   And I think patient expectations will change
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.380]   and doctors will have to follow suit.
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.620]   We tend to index the quality of American health care
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.220]   when you look at the average life expectancy.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.380]   First, you do men, women.
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.800]   And then, you look at white men versus black men
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.420]   versus brown men, white women versus black women, et cetera.
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.420]   And white men have always sort of been the standard bearer.
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.720]   And then, this odd thing has happened over the last three
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.580]   or four years where their life expectancy has
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.020]   started to get worse and worse as our percentage
[00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.700]   share of health care expenses, as a percentage of GDP,
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.980]   have gone up.
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:32.300]   And everybody gets up in arms because they're like, well,
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.360]   wait a minute.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.420]   Something is clearly so structurally broken
[00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.820]   that we're spending 15%, 20%, 30% a year,
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.180]   increasing every year.
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.220]   And we're dying now under the age of 80.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:48.540]   This thing should be a thing where we're living to 100.
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.300]   Why exactly is that thing happening?
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.380]   I can understand where you could say,
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:57.220]   maybe it's segregated to minority men or women
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:57.780]   or something.
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.500]   But this is not.
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.220]   This is basically everybody.
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.820]   So why are we dying sooner as we spend more?
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.260]   Yeah, because we're also increasingly spending
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.420]   on a lot of things that kill us.
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.500]   And we're not overspending on health care
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.460]   because we're spending on things that kill us.
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.580]   And then, our health care gets very expensive
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.140]   because we have terrible, terrible lifestyles.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:22.120]   And everyone is drinking way too much across all communities.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.280]   Everybody is eating totally processed foods.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.400]   These are becoming more and more readily available,
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.820]   increasingly so every year.
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:30.580]   And so, yes, in the very upper echelons,
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.260]   there's a movement towards wellness and more holistic
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:33.740]   lifestyle.
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.660]   But that has not really swept the nation yet.
[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.420]   And so we're all living really, really unhealthy lives,
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.220]   not caring about our preventive health
[00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.420]   and then spending a lot on health care down the line.
[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.940]   So you're saying, we just can't outrun our lifestyle.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:46.900]   Exactly.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.980]   Which is not our fault. I mean, corporations
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.660]   make it very, very difficult to live a healthy lifestyle
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:52.580]   in the US.
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.740]   And do you find examples of countries
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.460]   that have gotten population-level health
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.260]   issues, whether it's with respect to costs or outcomes,
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.380]   where you say, that is directionally something
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.300]   that we can learn?
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.060]   No, I have no good answer to that question.
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.380]   Because every company besides the US
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.180]   thinks it has the best health care system.
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.720]   But then, any time I talk to anybody
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.060]   in one of those countries-- like,
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.140]   I was speaking to people in Canada the other week.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.660]   And they hate their health care and think
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.740]   it's the worst thing ever.
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.540]   And they wait eight weeks to get UTI medication.
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.460]   And so, A, I just think it's too hard
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.100]   to compare our unwieldy country to other systems.
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.780]   And B, I don't even know people who are
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.020]   that happy with other systems.
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.700]   So no, I don't have a good answer.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:35.740]   How much of a role do you think Medicare, Medicaid, CMS
[00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:40.540]   can do to break the logjam versus waiting for politicians
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.140]   to pass legislation like Obamacare to try
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.860]   to reorient what's wrong?
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.460]   I think it really is both.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.140]   I think that HHS is playing a huge role
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.100]   in trying to get more and more value-based care
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.180]   models through Medicare.
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.940]   And they're making a huge push to do that.
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.140]   And so, it's slow and clunky.
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.940]   But I think they have the right idea.
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.180]   They want us to move towards a value-based care model.
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.540]   I've been thinking a lot about mental health recently,
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.380]   seeing what we've seen during the pandemic.
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:10.020]   A lot of young people or kids having these two years alone
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.380]   and what the second-or third-order effects of that.
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.020]   And just trying to get consensus in America around health care
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:17.900]   is very hard.
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.900]   But I think, since we've all suffered
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:24.500]   some degree of mental health over this COVID break, which
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.940]   I think drove a lot of people crazy
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.900]   and created a lot of anxiety, is there
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.020]   any way for us to think about universal health care
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.980]   but not have to have this nationwide discussion of all
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:36.500]   or nothing?
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.180]   And I was just thinking, mental health
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.980]   is something that everybody can appreciate.
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.660]   It's not that expensive to deal with.
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.420]   It's not surgery.
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.300]   Why can't we just agree as a country
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.140]   that anybody who wants to talk to a therapist or counselor
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.100]   will be able to do it for a sliding scale or a very
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.780]   small amount of money and maybe be
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.180]   able to just chip off one piece of the puzzle
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:58.540]   and say, you know what?
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.500]   Therapy will be $50 flat rate.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.740]   The country will pick up the other $50 or $150,
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.900]   whatever it is, to get this done.
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.500]   And maybe you could just speak about mental health
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.180]   as a larger issue, because it does
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.300]   seem to have so many downstream effects in terms
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.940]   of our physical health.
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:16.700]   Yeah.
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.580]   We've thought about this a lot at the LAMBEE,
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.040]   and we've tried to figure out a way
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.300]   to integrate mental health in a way
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.540]   where we would be able to make money, and we can't just yet.
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.820]   So yeah, there have been a lot of models that came out
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.060]   during COVID that allow for you to text with somebody
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.060]   and do virtual therapy.
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.020]   There are a lot of therapists who offer a sliding scale.
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.340]   But part of the reason it's a little bit more difficult
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.500]   is that the patient panel size, the number of people
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.960]   they can take on, is so much lower,
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.020]   because it's such a higher touch experience.
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.700]   And so it's hard to integrate it into the traditional primary
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:51.060]   model, where across the US, one physician
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.100]   has a panel of 2,300 patients on average.
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.060]   And so you just can't do something
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.500]   like that for mental health.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.540]   Are there large population health issues
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.620]   that you'd love to just get on the radar of folks
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:04.100]   in this room that are poorly understood?
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.260]   I'll give you an example.
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.060]   Like there is somebody I follow.
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.860]   She's a writer, I think, for the--
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.260]   I can't remember if it was the New York Times or something.
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.780]   And she said her best friend died of a heart attack
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:14.580]   in her 40s.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.420]   And then she had some stats about the incidence of heart
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.140]   disease amongst women versus men.
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.260]   And I had always assumed that it was largely
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.380]   a male-predominant issue, until I saw those stats
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.420]   and I realized, my god, this is a broadly pervasive issue.
[00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.220]   Maybe it's because of lifestyle, et cetera.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.780]   So I learned something in that moment I didn't know before.
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.900]   But any broad population-level issues
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.700]   that you think are really important for folks here
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.140]   to know about?
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:35.460]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.860]   I mean, sort of related to that, I
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.900]   would say nutrition label literacy
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.260]   is so hugely important.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.660]   There's so much scary marketing that people
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:44.140]   have to educate themselves on.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.820]   And it's such a part-time job to have
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:49.780]   to learn about why this product that looks extremely healthy
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.300]   and is using the new brand colors that are not Dorito-y,
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.260]   that looks like it should be vegan and organic,
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.540]   is actually really bad for you.
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.860]   So having more education on what makes for good food, I think,
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.460]   would cut out a huge, huge portion
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.020]   of our preventive lifestyle problems.
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.740]   How can people find out more about--
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.180]   it's Landry, L-A-N-D-R-Y?
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.940]   This is the nightmare of my life.
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.180]   It's the Landby, L-A-N-B-Y.
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.460]   It's on the big screen, Jason.
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:11.960]   Sorry.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.960]   It's just right there.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.220]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.720]   How can they find out more about it?
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.180]   If they wanted to become a member,
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.100]   how do they become a member?
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.020]   Are there memberships available?
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:19.140]   It's just right there.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:19.940]   It's just sold out.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:20.460]   L-A-N-D-Y.
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.740]   There's got to be a website, I'm assuming,
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.260]   or you have an email or something.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:24.780]   Yeah.
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.140]   Can it become a large scalable--
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.140]   But the website is actually L-A-N-D-Y.
[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.220]   That's why it's a little--
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.140]   Yeah, it's the Landry.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.020]   Mostly people call it the Lamby, like a lamb.
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.060]   So the Landry is--
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.060]   I keep hearing people mispronounce it.
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.580]   I've already lived a lifelong Candace life,
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.300]   and now I have a mispronunciation
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.340]   with the Lamby all the time.
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:42.920]   So you can just go to the lamby.com.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.260]   You can apply for membership at the top of the website.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:46.160]   It's in New York.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.200]   Can it scale?
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.200]   And are you going to raise money for this?
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.120]   Is it going to be a venture-based investment?
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.160]   Because it sounds fascinating to me as a business model.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.240]   Yeah, so we're actually raising our seed right now.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.160]   We predominantly raise money through our members
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.720]   so far, which has been really nice.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.920]   It's having our consumers as investors.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.480]   But yeah, it can reach a venture scale
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.960]   because the way we're doing it, not to get too in the weeds,
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.760]   is through a three-person care team model.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.940]   So we're able to take on more patients per panel
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.100]   because you're assigned not just a doctor, but also
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.940]   a nutritionist and a concierge manager who does
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.320]   all the patient homework for you.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.320]   So raising a seed and let me know where to send the check.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.000]   Sounds great.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.720]   Let's thank Candace for taking the time.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.480]   Thank you, guys.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.480]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.960]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.760]   We'll let your winners ride.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.960]   Rain Man David Saks.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.360]   And instead, we open source it to the fans,
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.200]   and they've just gone crazy with it.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:41.960]   Love you, Wesley.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.320]   I'm queen of Kinwani.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.760]   I'm going all in.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.120]   Let your winners ride.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.320]   Let your winners ride.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.960]   Let your winners ride.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.680]   Besties are gone.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.280]   That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway, Saks.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.480]   Oh, man.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.400]   My avatar will meet me at--
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.080]   We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.440]   because they're all just useless.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.240]   It's like this sexual tension that they just
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.400]   need to release somehow.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.200]   Let the beat be.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.600]   Let your beat be.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.680]   That's going to be a--
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.480]   We need to get merch.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.280]   Besties are gone.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.480]   I'm going all in.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:25.840]   I'm going all in.
