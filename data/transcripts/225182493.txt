[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840]   Alright, so let me read starting from verse 8, reading out of ESV.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.840]   But what does it say?
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.800]   "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that is the word of faith that
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.460]   we proclaim.
[00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.440]   Because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.680]   God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.160]   For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.680]   For the scripture says, everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.240]   For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.720]   his riches on all who call on him.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.000]   For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.280]   Let's pray.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.720]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.280]   We thank you, Father God, for the privilege that we have.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.920]   We pray, Father, as we've been studying through the book of Romans and being reminded and
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.440]   refreshed, Lord God, of what it is that we already have in you.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.600]   I pray that you would strengthen your church with your word, that our time together, Lord
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.840]   God, would be encouraging to you, that as we love you and love one another, that our
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.480]   church may be built according to your purpose and plan.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.800]   So we entrust this time to you in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.120]   I think for the last few weeks and obviously all through the book of Romans, we've been
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.680]   talking about justification by faith and specifically the emphasis, at least in the last few weeks,
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.720]   was on assurance of salvation.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.760]   How can we be secure?
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.640]   Let me just ask you a rhetorical question to give you a minute to think before we get
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.160]   into it.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:49.680]   Are you absolutely certain that if you die today, that you're going to go to heaven?
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.840]   Just a minute to think about it.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.560]   Are you absolutely certain?
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.720]   We've been studying through the book of Revelations, talking about the judgment coming upon mankind.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.320]   Are you absolutely certain that when Christ comes, that you are covered by the blood of
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.320]   Christ?
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.480]   We've been talking about this faith, this justification by faith alone, and if everything
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:14.400]   hinges upon the genuineness of this faith, is your faith genuine?
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.320]   Is it something that you've inherited?
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.680]   Is your faith something that you've just assumed?
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.640]   Is your faith something that you just kind of, you know, you grew up in a church and
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.440]   you just thought, "Well, I mean, of course."
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.720]   Or is it true faith?
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.360]   Is it faith based on Scripture?
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.440]   Is it biblical faith?
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.880]   Is it saving faith?
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:41.040]   So back to the question, are you sure that if you die today, that you will be saved?
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.360]   Now, this question, as fundamental as it is, and you probably may have been asked this
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.960]   question if somebody ever came and evangelized to you.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.680]   Maybe you remember a time when somebody shared this gospel with you and you were asked this
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.280]   question and that maybe led you to salvation.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.680]   But maybe it's been a while since you've even asked this question of yourself because you've
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.040]   just been assuming it for so long.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.400]   What is unique about our faith is that we are given, according to Scripture, absolute
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.840]   assurance and that's what justification by faith does.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.000]   Because it is by faith, it is not by works, that if we have genuine faith, he says, you
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   will be saved.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.120]   We have confidence in him.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.280]   If we confess that he is our Lord and believe in our heart that he has been raised from
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.320]   the dead, that we will be saved.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.900]   And so the three verses that we looked at last week, verses 11, 12, and 13, he says
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.060]   it repeatedly three separate times.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.920]   If you call on the name of the Lord, you will be saved.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.000]   If you believe in your heart, you will be saved.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   You will be saved.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.920]   So three separate times, almost for the purpose of crescendo, it's kind of like this is what
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.920]   he's been leading up to.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.920]   You will be saved.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.920]   You will be saved.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.240]   You will be saved.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.000]   I know I've had so many conversations with Jehovah's Witnesses.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.280]   Either they've come to my door or on campus or meeting somewhere.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.740]   And the conversation always kind of leads to where I would ask them, if you died, what
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.740]   would happen to you?
[00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.060]   And they can't answer that question.
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:17.620]   They said, I hope that I've knocked on enough doors, that I've done enough good deeds, that
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.020]   if they were persecuted enough for their faith, that hopefully when I die, that I'll be able
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.020]   to go to heaven.
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.380]   But they're not allowed to have assurance.
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.540]   So they're working hard that they would become one of those 144,000 people that's mentioned
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.900]   in the book of Revelation.
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.220]   If you talk to the Muslims, the Muslims are not allowed to have assurance either.
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.940]   The only way that they can be assured is that if they give their life in jihad, then they
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.100]   are assured that only those who give their life as a martyr and blow themselves up or
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.580]   whatever it is that they're doing, that they die in the context of jihad, that there's
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.120]   guaranteed that they're going to be in paradise.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.540]   So no wonder so many young people are being recruited for this.
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.380]   It's like, well, it's an easy way to get to paradise.
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.820]   Instead of living their whole life in fear that they may or may not have done enough,
[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.940]   that you blow themselves one time and then you're guaranteed into paradise.
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.820]   What's unique about the gospel and about the faith that we have in Christ, the scripture
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.300]   tells us that we have absolute assurance in Christ.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.860]   Assurance of salvation is fundamental and essential to our faith.
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:24.860]   Assurance of salvation.
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.640]   So when I ask you that question, do you have assurance of salvation?
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.260]   If you even hesitated for a moment to answer that question, we need to take a step back
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.540]   and examine what Paul has been saying.
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.860]   Because without assurance, you will not be able to pray effectively.
[00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.140]   Because you're going to doubt, is God answering my prayer?
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.940]   Do I have this access to God without hindrance?
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.300]   Assurance of salvation is what gives us confidence to enter the throne of grace with confidence
[00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.300]   because he promised.
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:01.780]   So every promise in scripture is directly linked to my assurance of salvation.
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:09.500]   Our assurance that when we die and go to heaven is linked to this, again, assurance of salvation.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:17.880]   My desire to love people, sanctification, all of it is directly linked to this assurance.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.720]   We can never be certain.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.900]   We can't pray effectively.
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.700]   We can't even share with other people if we don't have this assurance.
[00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.000]   So our natural reaction to that is if assurance of salvation is that essential, then let's
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.340]   make sure that every single person has assurance.
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.220]   And I can jump all the steps and instead of going through all of the things that Paul
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.580]   is going through, let's just say, don't ever question your faith.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.380]   In fact, I've had a conversation with somebody very recently.
[00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.780]   He said, you should never say that.
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:54.060]   You should never ask somebody to question their faith because it is so essential.
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.420]   It's so fundamental to our faith.
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.860]   But the problem with that proposition is Paul himself questions that.
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.180]   In 2 Corinthians 13, 5, they examine yourself to see if you're really of the faith.
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:13.980]   2 Peter 1, 10 says, be diligent to make sure you're calling an election.
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.540]   Make sure of it.
[00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.580]   In fact, even in the book of Psalms, the text that we read this morning, 139, he says, search
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.620]   me, O God, and know my heart.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.780]   Try me and know my thoughts and see if there's any grievous way in me and lead me in the
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.140]   way of everlasting.
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.460]   Even in the prophets, even in the Psalms, they come before God and say, search me to
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:40.820]   make sure that there's nothing hindering me, that I have this genuine faith.
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:49.900]   Again, before we go any further, the point of all of this is justification by faith.
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:54.300]   The ultimate end goal of this is to have assurance of salvation.
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.740]   If you are absolutely convinced by justification by faith, that you ought to have absolute
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:03.220]   confidence that God is hearing your prayers.
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.860]   You ought to have absolute confidence that you are covered by the blood of Christ, that
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.100]   when you die, that you have heaven waiting for you.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:15.500]   But this confidence should not be a superficial knee-jerk reaction without careful examination.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:21.140]   See, the purpose of Paul asking this question in Corinthians, examine yourself to see if
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.900]   you're really of the faith, is really because they've been strained.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.300]   Paul says, did you forget that Christ is in you?
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.740]   The church is in chaos because you've forgotten who you are worshiping, what it is that you
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.420]   have in Christ, and maybe you have drifted away from what it is that you have in Christ.
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:41.820]   And that's why Paul is telling the church, he's not talking to non-Christians, he's telling
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:47.860]   the church, take a step back and re-examine what it is that you have in Christ, that you
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:53.020]   may be assured of your salvation, and that assurance of salvation would lead you to worship
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.500]   and honor and glorify God.
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:01.100]   The goal of what we've been studying is to do that.
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:08.380]   It's for us to cause examination to see, is this faith genuine?
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:13.300]   And if you come at the end of this to conclusions, it is absolutely genuine, then what does that
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.580]   mean?
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.740]   How does that affect you?
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.060]   How does it affect the way you think?
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.300]   How does that affect your marriage?
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.380]   How does that affect the way you raise your children?
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.900]   Last week we looked at how Paul, again, everything that he's been saying, he concludes with an
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:32.500]   exclamation mark, "If you believe, if you call, if you confess, you will be saved."
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.580]   And so we looked at the first two part of it, and today we're going to look at the third
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:41.140]   part where it says, "Same God with the same gospel results in the same salvation."
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.340]   So that's what we want to look at today, and then the three sub-points underneath that
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:50.940]   is that the same salvation, same gift that we have is that we will not be put to shame,
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:57.180]   that he will bestow riches upon Jews and Gentiles, and then ultimately we will be saved.
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.580]   It's a simple conclusion that he's been trying to make throughout all of the Book of Romans
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.580]   that we will be saved.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.620]   So let's look at the first one.
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:10.700]   He says in verse 11, "For the scripture says, 'Everyone who believes in him will not be
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:11.700]   put to shame.'"
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:19.300]   In English, and in our culture, when I hear the word put to shame, at least the way that
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.140]   we use it, it's like, "Oh, he shamed you."
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.180]   Let's say if you're in some sort of sports competition, and somebody shames you means
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.340]   that they dominated you.
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.380]   He completely overpowered you.
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.140]   He humiliated you.
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.940]   So we think of, "He will not be ashamed."
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.500]   It's like, "Oh, you know, the crisis is going to come in, and we won't be dominated."
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.940]   Because that's the way we would think.
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:44.620]   But the term that Paul uses, "will not be put to shame," has much more significance,
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:50.540]   theological significance, than what you and I would hear when we first read it.
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:55.900]   So let's think about it in the context of what Paul is saying, theologically.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:02.500]   Where is shame first seen, introduced to us in the scripture?
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.340]   Just think about it for a second.
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:11.220]   Where is the concept or idea of shame first introduced in scripture?
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.620]   Yeah, so I hear you mumbling already.
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.620]   I see it.
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.900]   I see your lips moving, right?
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.620]   It was at the Garden of Eden.
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:24.380]   As soon as they fell, what was the very first thing that had happened when their eyes got
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.380]   opened?
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.260]   They recognized their, what, shame.
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:33.060]   And as soon as they recognized their shame, the very first act that they did was they
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.820]   covered themselves.
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.860]   They felt this shame.
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.980]   And then in this shame, when they recognized God, what do they do?
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.340]   They cover themselves from God.
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:44.240]   They try to hide from Him.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:52.260]   So the very first ramification of sin coming into mankind was shame.
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:59.100]   So when Paul is talking about how if you believe in Him, confess that you will not be put to
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:03.500]   shame, do you think that Paul has that in mind?
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:08.100]   That the very thing, the curse of mankind that represented in this shame, he says, basically
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:12.100]   saying that he will reverse this curse.
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:19.500]   Think about what shame does to us in our families, in our relationships.
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:25.420]   Think about what it does to us with friendships, maybe even inside the church.
[00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:30.780]   I mean, obviously superficially we can think about loneliness, not feeling connected, maybe
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:34.500]   not feeling loved, even between husband and wife, that we can't be completely honest and
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.580]   open with one another because we're afraid that we're going to be judged and they're
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.820]   not going to be able to accept my sins.
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:46.700]   Think about the ramification of sin just in general human life, human experience.
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.540]   He says when Adam and Eve fell, he said, "You shall surely die."
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:55.980]   But the first evidence of this death came in a form of shame.
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:59.180]   They hid from each other, and then they ultimately hid from God.
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:03.260]   And the problem with hiding from God is that God is the author of life.
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.740]   He's the one that we need to be connected to, to have life, but to have shame and to
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:12.860]   hide from him means that we were disconnected from this very life.
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.980]   Paul is not simply saying that if you confess your sins or if you confess him as Lord and
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.820]   Savior that you're no longer going to be dominated.
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.740]   Humiliation is going to be gone.
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.940]   There's a much deeper theological significance of what Paul is saying.
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:33.220]   He's basically saying that that shame that came in the form of sin, he's going to reverse
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.620]   this curse.
[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.380]   This curse of mankind is going to be reversed.
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:43.620]   In Isaiah 49 verse 23, he said, "Those who wait for me shall not be put to shame."
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:48.060]   Now again, in our modern understanding to wait simply means to just kind of sit and
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.460]   do nothing, right, and wait for him to come.
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.820]   Obviously that's not what the psalmist means or Isaiah means.
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.740]   It's like those who wait for him.
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:05.300]   The word wait is also the way we would understand calling, those who confess or seek or to believe.
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:12.700]   Those who believe or wait or call or confess, he said, "He will not be put to shame."
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:21.060]   Think about how much of our life is in pursuit so that we can feel alive, so we can have
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.060]   a better life.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.340]   You go to school, get a good education, so we can have a better life.
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.380]   We marry people and have kids and do all the things that we're doing so that we can have
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.420]   a better life.
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:34.820]   Nobody actively pursues a more difficult life.
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:40.820]   But how much of life is it disappointment after disappointment after disappointment?
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.620]   Like in reality.
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.300]   That's why typically when you look at the young teenagers or maybe young 20-year-olds
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:51.300]   and they have this view of life, and I know some of you guys are in that category, like
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.860]   I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:59.580]   And by the time you're in your 30s, like, "Heh, 40-year-olds don't even flinch.
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.820]   50-year-olds are cynical."
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.220]   It's like, "Yeah, right.
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.620]   Let's see how long this lasts."
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.300]   Life has a tendency to humble all of us.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:13.420]   And you experience enough of it, you just as kid in school, anybody who's happy is like,
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.900]   "Yeah, we'll see."
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.100]   Basically what God is saying is like everything else that we pursue in life, the end result
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:28.260]   is greater shame, greater difficulty, greater life, greater suffocation of joy.
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:33.660]   But it says, "He who puts his trust on you, waits upon the Lord, will not be put to shame."
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:40.860]   Again in Isaiah 54, 4-5, it says, "Fear not, for you will not be ashamed, but not be not
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.600]   confounded, for you will not be disgraced.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.940]   For you will forget the shame of your youth and the reproach of your widowhood.
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:49.860]   You will remember no more.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.780]   For your maker is your husband, and the Lord of hosts is his name.
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:58.700]   And the Holy One of Israel, your Redeemer, the God of whole earth, he is called."
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:06.740]   You know, we typically think about the love of God or agape, and we always refer that
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.540]   to or compare that to the mother's love or the father's love for their kids.
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:15.100]   And yeah, that's probably the closest thing that we can imagine.
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.060]   Every once in a while somebody will say, "You know what?
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.060]   I love you, brother.
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.340]   I'll take a bullet for you."
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:28.180]   Maybe you mean it, but again, maybe I'm cynical because I think most people will duck when
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.180]   they hear bullets.
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.540]   You know what I mean?
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.300]   I think you're going to end up hiding behind me and in front of me.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.660]   Maybe I'm just being cynical.
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:37.660]   That's just human nature.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:42.380]   But I think there's plenty of evidences, and I think if you're a parent, you know exactly
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.380]   what I'm talking about.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:48.540]   If you're a child, you feel this sense of, you know, like love and benevolence toward
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.540]   your kid.
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:54.020]   And if there is a gunfire, if there's any relationship that will jump on their kid to
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:58.240]   protect them, it's probably mother's love and father's love.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:04.200]   But even the mother's love and father's love is limited and is finite.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:09.580]   Even with my best intention, I'm limited by my own limitations.
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:13.220]   I'm limited by my own sin, my own selfishness.
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.780]   No matter how much I tell my, I would promise my kids or you'd promise your kids that I
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:23.180]   will be there for you, you may intend that, but you don't have the power to fulfill that.
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.860]   I will never let anything harm you.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:28.180]   You may intend that, but you can't fulfill that because you're limited.
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.020]   You're not all powerful.
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:35.820]   So God is reminding us, you may pursue all of these things, but he says, "I am your husband.
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.700]   I am your redeemer.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:43.660]   And the only one who can make this promise and actually fulfill it is God himself.
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.720]   Everything else will lead to disappointment.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:52.860]   But if you wait upon me, if you confess me, if you call upon me," he says, "you will not
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.640]   be put to shame."
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:04.820]   So he gives us absolute assurance and confidence that only he and he alone could fulfill that.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:09.220]   So this invitation to come to him is not an invitation to abandon your life.
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:14.020]   It really is an invitation to come and live in Christ because the only one who can actually
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.560]   give us life is Christ and Christ alone.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.460]   So that's the first thing that he says.
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:23.460]   Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.
[00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:28.060]   But secondly, in verse 12, he says, "For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:34.760]   the same Lord is the Lord of all, bestowing his riches in all who call upon the Lord."
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.980]   Now we may read that again, Jew, Gentile, of course, you know, us being Gentiles, it's
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:43.520]   like we've been reconciled, we're in a church, we worship the same God.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:49.260]   But imagine what that would have sounded like to the first readers, to the Jew and the Gentiles.
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:54.580]   I know if you've been following the news, North Korea has been acting up, beyond acting
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.740]   up.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.800]   For years, they've been concerned about North Korea.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:02.140]   They may possibly get a nuclear bomb and they may possibly, if we don't stop it, that they're
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.620]   going to be able to develop technology that's going to get the bomb all the way over here.
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:12.020]   Now they're talking about the last nuclear test that they did or the bomb that they launched,
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:16.320]   that it may have the capability to reach Alaska and Hawaii.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:20.940]   And this is not a maybe threat, it seems like they've already gotten there.
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:25.100]   And so now it's been heightened, now it's not a hypothetical.
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:29.620]   Now like if something isn't done, and we may have to use force, right?
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:33.060]   We've been talking about all this rhetoric before, but now we're on the brink of that.
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:37.700]   There's a group of people in Korea that is protesting, that's trying to, "You know what?
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.540]   Let's back off our rhetoric and this conflict.
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.620]   Why don't we get everybody to the table and we can reconcile our differences."
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:49.700]   And eventually the two nations becoming one, North Korea and South Korea reunite.
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:55.380]   And there's a whole movement, especially the younger generation in South Korea, wanting
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.380]   to reunite.
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:00.020]   And there's a bunch of people in North Korea, obviously they want to reunite so that they
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.500]   can dominate more people in the end.
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.460]   In my mind I said, "It's just ridiculous.
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:11.660]   How are you going to have a totalitarian government who's brainwashed their people for the last
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:19.340]   60, 70 years that their leader is a kind of a deity, and they're living at least by our
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:24.660]   modern day standards, the majority of the people are living in poverty level, and then
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:30.900]   reunite with South Korea and live together and pound out our differences and have one
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.540]   government and live kumbaya."
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.540]   You know what I mean?
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.980]   I mean, ridiculous.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:43.460]   And as strange and as ridiculous as that may sound, if you said that the Jews and the Gentiles
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:49.300]   would be worshiping the same God, calling each other brothers and sisters in Christ,
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:54.540]   having a tax collector be their leader, and a Pharisee sitting there and listening to
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:21:01.340]   them, it would have been just as ridiculous or even more ridiculous.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:05.500]   The whole point of Phariseeism is to be set apart.
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.740]   The name itself, Pharisee, means to be set apart.
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.460]   And they believe that they needed to be set apart in order to be right with God.
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:18.700]   And you know the primary thing that they needed to be set apart from to be considered righteous?
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.700]   Gentiles.
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:28.580]   Their whole spiritual leadership, their whole identity was to be set apart from the Gentiles
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.540]   so that they may receive the blessing of God.
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:35.980]   And all of a sudden, these apostles are coming and saying, "No, we worship the same Lord.
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:40.220]   Not only are we worshiping the same Lord, we are one in Christ, that all of us have
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.380]   sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all of us need to be washed in the blood
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.620]   of Christ."
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:52.180]   Imagine how difficult that would have been for them to accept, just humanly speaking.
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:57.220]   It's impossible to say, "Oh, if we get together and if we just kind of agree on right theology."
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:03.260]   Imagine how little it takes to divide even within the church.
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:11.380]   We have, even within the church, we are divided by denomination, by age, by culture, by language.
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:16.380]   And even within the church that hold the same doctrines and live together and we're serving
[00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:21.540]   together, even within the church, even this church, how easily we can get divided.
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:28.100]   Ministry of philosophy, certain decisions are made, certain people that we like or don't
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.620]   like.
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:36.020]   How difficult it is to just gather a group of people together to unite to do something.
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:43.140]   If you've ever led games, you probably will never do it twice.
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.140]   You know what I mean?
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:50.220]   And if you've done it twice, Andy Wong, we love you and keep doing a good job.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:54.580]   But if you've ever led games, you know exactly how it is to lead anything because it's very
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:59.180]   difficult to get a bunch of people who have different opinions about everything together
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.100]   and say, "Let's be together."
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.460]   How can you possibly think that the Jews and the Gentiles are going to come together and
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.860]   worship the same God and call each other brother and sister in Christ and develop any kind
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.420]   of community?
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.500]   Humanly speaking, it is absolutely impossible.
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:18.100]   What could possibly bring these people together?
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.660]   If it wasn't for the resurrection of Jesus Christ, if it wasn't for the power of the
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:26.020]   cross, humanly speaking, it would have been impossible to bring them together.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:29.740]   Their apostle couldn't be articulate enough.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.320]   They couldn't have preached well enough.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.540]   They couldn't have been organized well enough.
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.540]   Are you kidding me?
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:39.100]   Ephesians chapter 2, 17 and 18, it says, "And he came and preached peace to you who were
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.780]   far off and peace to those who were near.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:47.500]   For through him we both have access in one spirit to the Father, so that you are no longer
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:52.340]   strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.200]   of God."
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:24:00.340]   The reason why they came together is because God made it, brought peace.
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.500]   And he's been prophesying this.
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.700]   He's been telling this for hundreds of years, that peace offering.
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.740]   Every time they would come and bring a peace offering, they would take the meaty portion
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:08.740]   of it.
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:13.680]   After they gave offering of the fatted portion, they would sit alongside and have a picnic
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.220]   with the priests and with the family members, signifying that because they have peace with
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.220]   God, they have peace with one another.
[00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:26.820]   So even between Jews and Gentiles, even between tax collectors and Pharisees, that because
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:32.460]   they have peace with God, now they are able to have peace with one another.
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:37.860]   The only thing that brings us together is the love of Christ.
[00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:44.980]   Church is an awesome place of fellowship, community, love, when it is filled with people
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:48.400]   who are being affected by the love of Christ.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:54.260]   And we are compelled by this love to serve one another, to give to one another.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:25:00.620]   But church is an ugly place when we forget about what we are united with and we begin
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.020]   to highlight our differences.
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.940]   There's a lot of people in this room sitting maybe next to you, to the left, to the right
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:11.020]   and front behind you, you would never talk to if it wasn't for Christ.
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.060]   You wouldn't be in the same room with these people.
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.320]   And I bet you you've thought of it.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.140]   I bet you sometimes you've been told, "Man, if I wasn't a Christian, I wouldn't have
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.620]   to deal with these people."
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:31.940]   When what unites us isn't highlighted and we're not being affected by it, and we're
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:39.020]   all with our own ideas, with our own gifts, with our own uniqueness, and everybody's
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:44.400]   coming in, all of a sudden you've got everybody in this room together having their own opinions
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.540]   about how all the things have been.
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.340]   I mean, it's an ugly place to be.
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:51.580]   And a lot of times the church has become ugly for that reason.
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:58.260]   When people are not being affected by the love of Christ, when our central thing, why
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:03.460]   we gather together and why we do what we do isn't because of our reconciliation with
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.340]   God.
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.340]   How such trivial things could easily divide us.
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.540]   Every once in a while I get an email from somebody and says, "You know what?
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:16.020]   I really want to come to your church, but I can't stand your drums."
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.540]   And it's not because our drums are bad.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.700]   It's just that I don't want rock music.
[00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:26.380]   Or I get emails sometimes, it's like, "Oh, you know, I love this and that, but it's
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.380]   not rock enough."
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.100]   You know what I mean?
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.860]   I came from this church and their praise band is this, or vice versa.
[00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.060]   I've heard it on both sides.
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.180]   Our service is too early, too late.
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.140]   Our people are too young, too old.
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.860]   I mean, just things that can easily divide us.
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:49.260]   But the beauty of the church is that God gathers people, Jews and Gentiles alike, who would
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:54.140]   have nothing in common other than the love of Christ.
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:59.140]   God brings them together and says, "We worship the same Lord."
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:04.860]   Fellowship is so different and it changes everything.
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:10.180]   When people who are gathered together with absolute assurance of Christ, assurance of
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:15.740]   eternal salvation, who desire to worship God in spirit and in truth, live in harmony with
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.700]   one another.
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:22.500]   One of the greatest evidence of the power of the gospel is that.
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.300]   I mean, one of the greatest evidence of something spectacular happening in the early church
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.700]   is the fellowship between Jews and Gentiles.
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.780]   That's one of the things that even non-Christians, even people who want to deny the resurrection
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.460]   of Christ, can't explain.
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.980]   How do the Jews and the Gentiles come together?
[00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:43.180]   I can see why the fishermen maybe, they thought that if they follow Jesus that they're going
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.220]   to get something from him.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.460]   Maybe the poor people came because there were promises of food being distributed at the
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.420]   church and they can try to explain all of that, but they can't explain how the Jews
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.920]   and the Gentiles got together.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.440]   So even the non-Christians, something happened.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:59.440]   Something happened.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:03.020]   There's no denying something powerful happened.
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:10.460]   The only thing that you and I know that explains that is the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:13.820]   The power of the gospel has brought people together.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:18.540]   When we are being affected by the love of Christ and the richness that he says he gives
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:22.120]   us, both Jews and Gentiles, he will bestow riches upon us.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:26.900]   In Romans 9, 23, "In order to make known the riches of his glory for the vessels of mercy
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:31.540]   which he has prepared beforehand for glory."
[00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:39.740]   That you and I, again, the assurance of salvation assures us that we are rich in Christ.
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:45.020]   How many of us are frustrated because we've forgotten the riches we have in Christ, that
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:50.460]   we live every single day complaining like we're beggars?
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.980]   Because we don't have this, we don't have that.
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.580]   Not realizing what he has given us.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.500]   In 2 Corinthians 8, 9, "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:06.660]   rich yet for your sake he became poor so that by his poverty might become rich."
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:09.380]   That's us.
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.380]   That's a description of what Christ has done for us.
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.820]   We've become rich.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:18.420]   He became poor so you and I could become rich.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:26.060]   And that's why Paul's core prayer in the book of Ephesians as he's describing predestination,
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.420]   the election, and he's talking about his salvation.
[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:35.260]   He says, "My prayer is that according to the riches of his glory," Ephesians 3, 16, "According
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:39.460]   to the riches of his glory that he may grant you to be strengthened with power through
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:43.460]   his spirit in your inner being so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, that
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:47.400]   you being rooted in grounded love may have strength to comprehend with all the saints
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.980]   what is a breadth and length and height and depth and to know the love of Christ that
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:57.900]   surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God."
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:02.100]   Paul's main reason why he's been expositing for three chapters is that you may understand
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:06.860]   what it is that you have in Christ together with all the saints.
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:12.180]   You know, we're in the NBA offseason where these players are going back and forth, re-signing
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:16.300]   contracts and just the amount of money that they're signing for is just ridiculous.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:21.980]   Some of you guys who are Golden State Warrior fans, you know that Steph Curry signed a contract
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:25.300]   for $201 million for five years.
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.300]   Ridiculous.
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.300]   It was record-breaking.
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:32.780]   It was the highest paid NBA player ever in history.
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:37.940]   And then yesterday, James Harden signed a contract for four years for $228 million,
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.980]   and then they broke it down to somehow like, I guess, the last year of his contract, he's
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:50.260]   going to be making almost half a million dollars per game that he plays, per game that he plays.
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.820]   That's per game that he plays.
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.620]   He gets half a million dollars.
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:54.940]   Oh my gosh.
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:31:01.380]   I don't know about you, but the first thought that I had was, "Why couldn't I play basketball?"
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.260]   That was that first…
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:08.020]   Only if I was a little bit taller, younger and faster, right?
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.300]   Maybe you have thought that.
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:14.700]   How many times have you contemplated or thought about, it's like, you know, the Powerball
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:21.220]   or it's at 60 million or 100 million, and maybe you don't normally play lottery or
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.100]   whatever, and it's like, "What if?"
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:28.660]   And you daydream, you know, "What would I do with $100 million?
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:37.580]   I'll quit my job, pay off the mortgage, help my parents, pay tithe, of course, you know,
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:42.900]   I'm a Christian, so I got to, you know, give to the church and feed the poor."
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:47.380]   You know, and you fantasize about what you would do with the travel and do all this stuff.
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:54.540]   And these are all imaginations, you know, just wishful thinking, daydreaming.
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:32:00.480]   But when was the last time we thought about what we would do with the riches that we have
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.380]   in Christ?
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:08.980]   Not daydreaming, not fantasizing "what if," but to have absolute assurance that we have
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:16.100]   these riches, that we are co-heirs with Christ, that He says that if you ask in faith, I will
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.420]   answer you, that we have this.
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:25.660]   This is what assurance salvation does for us, to have these riches in Christ and then
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:29.980]   to not to think at all about, "What am I going to do with this?"
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:34.940]   When was the last time that we actually thought and contemplated, "What am I going to do with
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.780]   these riches that I have in Christ?"
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.380]   And that's what He says that we have.
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:43.060]   Colossians 2, 2, "That their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, to
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.660]   reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God's
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.620]   mystery which is Christ."
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:56.260]   This unsearchable riches that beyond our understanding, that even now, even after all this time, we're
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:00.140]   still searching and we're still scratching the surface of what it is that we actually
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.980]   have in Christ.
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:06.020]   That happiness is not what we, not having what we have, but wanting what we already
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.700]   have.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:13.720]   And that's what assurance of salvation is, is assurance that we have this.
[00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:19.420]   If we are assured that we have this, how does it affect our life?
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:22.360]   How does it affect our worship?
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.220]   How does it affect our fellowship?
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:29.420]   How does it affect our future?
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:36.740]   What unites us is much more powerful than what distinguishes us.
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.580]   The love of Christ compels us.
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:44.260]   And that's why in Revelations 3, 18, He says to the Laodicean church, "I counsel you to
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:49.540]   buy from me gold refined by fire so that you may be rich, white garments so that you may
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:55.980]   clothe yourself with the shame of your nakedness may not be seen and salve to anoint your eyes
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:59.940]   so that you may see."
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:03.980]   Not to run to this world and everything else to cover it up and only if I had this, only
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:08.580]   if I had that, and all it does is lead to more frustration.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:17.460]   But to come to recognize through faith that He is my life, that He is my treasure.
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:21.940]   Whoever comes to God must first believe that He is.
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.940]   And He is a rewarder of those who diligently seeking.
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:26.760]   He is a rewarder.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:34.580]   Not my company, not my kids, not my family, not my friends.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:41.780]   So if I have this assurance of salvation, wouldn't that cause me to seek Him out more
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.540]   than anything else?
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:47.420]   Let me conclude with this because the third and final thing that He says is a repeat of
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:48.420]   what He's been saying.
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:52.860]   He says, "For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:56.940]   Absolute certainty that you will be saved.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.220]   Let me illustrate it this way.
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:05.100]   Some of us knew we were in need of salvation.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:11.740]   So when the lifeboat came to get us, we rejoiced from the beginning.
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:15.580]   You know, let's say you were on a boat and you kind of drifted and you ran out of gas
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:19.660]   or whatever and you ran into a storm and you were about to sink and you're about to die
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.700]   and you're crying out, "Save me, we're going to die."
[00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:26.420]   And then all of a sudden this lifeguard comes all the way out and he said, "Wow, the lifeguard's
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:27.420]   out here?
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:30.780]   We're like hundreds of miles away and we're in the middle of the storm and they risked
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.380]   their lives to come and save me."
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:36.960]   So when they tell us to get on the boat, we get on the boat and say, "Thank you so much."
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.980]   So from day one, you're, "Thank you so much for what you did.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.700]   I can't believe that you actually risked your life.
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.220]   You have family too and you came to get us.
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.620]   Thank you."
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:50.540]   Some of us were saved that way.
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:54.100]   And so some of us, when we got saved that way, from day one, you lived your life to
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.540]   the fullest.
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:36:01.380]   And even to this day, you remember when you got saved and you remember what you got saved
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:06.180]   from and you remember who came to save you and what he risked and what he sacrificed
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:11.540]   to get you and it affected you deeply and changed you.
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:14.620]   A lot of us didn't get saved like that.
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:19.980]   A lot of us were sitting on a boat, we drifted out hundreds, maybe thousands of miles from
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:26.580]   shore in danger and a storm is coming and you're not even aware of it.
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:31.660]   If you just kept on going this path, the storm would have come and you would have just been
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.740]   engulfed by the waves and you would have died.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:34.740]   But you weren't aware of it.
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:35.740]   You were just enjoying yourself.
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.180]   You're sipping on your boba, watching Netflix.
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.340]   You don't know what's going on.
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:43.340]   And then the lifeguard comes and he comes and says, "You've drifted away.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.340]   What are you doing?
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.940]   You're hundreds of miles, thousands of miles away.
[00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:46.940]   A storm is coming in.
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.300]   You're going to die."
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.820]   And he's like, "What?"
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:55.720]   And you start thinking, "Hmm, why did they come all the way out here to do that?
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.060]   Maybe there is a storm coming."
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.980]   And so you believed him.
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.900]   You didn't know that you were in danger.
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:02.900]   You never sensed it.
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:03.900]   You never saw the storm coming.
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.740]   You didn't even know you were lost.
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.820]   You just found out because somebody came and got you and said, "Okay, I believe in you."
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.820]   You got on the boat.
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:15.420]   And as you're going back, they're showing you, "Look at the storm coming in," and showing
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:20.180]   you all the news, showing you where you were at and then where you should have been.
[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:24.700]   And then it starts to dawn on you, "Oh, my gosh.
[00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.600]   That's where I was?"
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.980]   And then you start realizing, like, "Why did you come out here?
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.740]   You would have died.
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:35.700]   If you didn't find us in time, you would have died."
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.020]   And you start thinking, "You risked your life to come and get me."
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:43.820]   And so it didn't happen immediately, but it started dawning on you what it is that you've
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:48.220]   been saved from and what it is exactly these lifeguards did to come and get you.
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:53.740]   And so it didn't happen immediately, but as your understanding of salvation began to grow,
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.940]   you start saying, "Oh, my gosh."
[00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.900]   And you have the same reaction as that person who was crying out.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:03.420]   It's like, "I didn't understand it, but now I get it.
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.540]   Thank you so much for risking everything to come and get me."
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:11.260]   So he didn't know immediately, but eventually as he began to know, he started to change.
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:14.240]   He started being sanctified.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:19.580]   And then there are some people who didn't know that they needed salvation, that they
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:20.740]   didn't know that they were in danger.
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:25.820]   And all of a sudden, this lifeboat comes and they come and say, "Hey, what are you doing?
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:27.820]   If you keep going down that path, you're going to die."
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:36.900]   And he said, "Well, okay, I'm tired of being on this boat anyway.
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.260]   Maybe I'll try this."
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:45.180]   And so you kind of jumped on the boat because that guy seems very serious.
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:47.220]   And what have I got to lose?
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.620]   I'm tired of being on this tiny boat.
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:50.940]   That boat looks a lot bigger.
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:54.180]   And so you got on the boat.
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:39:01.500]   And he's taking you back, but the whole time you're on the boat, you never even knew that
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.860]   you were in danger.
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.780]   You've never come to the conviction, the danger that you were in.
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.060]   So therefore, you don't even know.
[00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.860]   I mean, you say, "Okay, you say so.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.980]   Do you know how hard it was for us to come here?
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:11.980]   We risked our lives."
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:15.260]   It's like, "Okay, thank you.
[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.380]   You know, what do you got to drink?
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.700]   You know, I'm running out of boba.
[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.340]   You got something?"
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:28.160]   Some people's response to their salvation is just that.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:31.940]   So we're trying to muster up thankfulness, but it's not really there.
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:35.700]   We're trying to muster up worship, but it's not there.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:40.940]   And you see other people like just in love with, "Thank you for saving me.
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.140]   Thank you for saving me."
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:43.140]   And you're watching that.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:45.660]   It's like, "Huh, they're really emotional.
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:48.180]   They're really emotional."
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.180]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.620]   They're like, "Jesus freaks over there."
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:55.260]   So it's like maybe some people are like that because of their personality, and some people
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.580]   like really want to give their life and follow Christ.
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.340]   And you know, not everybody was called.
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.340]   Not everybody.
[00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.340]   And so you're trying to kind of justify it.
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:09.220]   It's like, "Well, maybe I'm just not that emotional type of a person."
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:17.700]   Not realizing that it might be because that you don't realize what you've been saved from.
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:24.020]   Because you know it in your head, but you never realize the danger that you're in.
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:29.780]   You know in your head theologically what Christ has done, but you don't really know the sacrifice
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.900]   that He made to come and get you.
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:39.200]   And as a result of that, your worship is something that you're just trying to muster up instead
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.420]   of having a reaction.
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:47.140]   Why is this so important?
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:54.420]   Because if we're saved by faith and faith alone, if faith is the only thing that connects
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:59.620]   us to God, if genuine faith is the only way that we can have assurance that when we pray
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:10.660]   He hears us, to long and to look for His coming, then shouldn't this faith be absolutely certain?
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:17.700]   Shouldn't every Christian take a step back and examine in order that I may revisit why
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:25.780]   I got saved, what I got saved from, and what it is that I hope in Christ?
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:31.100]   Let me conclude with this reading of this passage in 1 John 4, 16 and 18.
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:37.260]   Again, the end goal of all of this is not simply to give you a knee-jerk reaction, "Hey,
[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:39.980]   nobody ever questioned your faith."
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:43.900]   Or the other extreme is like, "Nobody should ever have assurance."
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:50.060]   The end goal is that we have assurance, a real assurance, that we understand the power
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.820]   of the gospel.
[00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:59.380]   We understand who we are in the light of who He is, and as a result of that, we are changed.
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:04.300]   First John 4, 16 and 18 says, "So we have come to know and to believe the love that
[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.220]   God has for us."
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:11.860]   God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God and whoever abides in Him.
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:16.940]   By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment,
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:21.140]   because as He is so also are we in this world.
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:26.820]   There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, for fear has to do with punishment,
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.940]   and whoever fears has not been perfected in love.
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:35.740]   I pray that as we examine ourselves, that our conclusion would be, "Yes, I do have
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:36.740]   faith.
[00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.460]   I do believe."
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:43.900]   And with that belief, come to the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:49.300]   As we open up the communion table, I'm going to ask you again one by one to take your time,
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:53.620]   contemplation and prayer, unconfessed sins to confess.
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:59.380]   If you've been living day to day in lukewarmness, confess that as well, because God calls that
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:01.060]   as sin as well.
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:04.640]   So come before the Lord and confess.
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:09.020]   And when you come in, we're not inviting you because you're good, we're not inviting you
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:12.220]   because you've read your Bible and you've been perfect.
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:19.460]   We're inviting you to remember your riches in Christ, to come and celebrate.
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:26.380]   So I want to read a passage for you in 1 Corinthians 11, and then again I want to remind you, if
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:32.260]   you are a born-again Christian, to come when you are prepared, when we open up the table.
[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:37.300]   If you have not been baptized and you haven't confessed Him as Lord and Savior, we ask you
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:38.980]   to remain in your seats.
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:42.460]   And those of you who are coming up, just as a reminder again to come on both sides and
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:45.420]   go down the middle aisle so that we don't create traffic here.
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:49.300]   So these two rows come this way and these two rows come that way.
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:50.300]   Okay?
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:56.780]   So 1 Corinthians 11, verse 23, "For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you,
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:00.580]   that the Lord Jesus on the night when He was betrayed took bread, and when He had given
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:04.020]   things He broke it and said, 'This is my body which is for you.
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:05.960]   Do this in remembrance of me.'
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:11.460]   In the same way also He took the cup after supper, saying, 'This cup is a new covenant
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:12.460]   in my blood.
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:16.620]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.'"
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:17.620]   Let's pray.
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.900]   Heavenly Father, we entrust this time to you.
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:27.900]   Help us, Lord God, for each one of us as we come to carefully examine where we are, that
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:34.220]   we may reaffirm your love for us, reaffirm our confidence in Christ, and as a result,
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:38.860]   Lord God, that we may truly live a life worthy of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:42.300]   So as we open up this table, we pray for your grace.
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.300]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:43.300]   Amen.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:44.220]   Amen.
