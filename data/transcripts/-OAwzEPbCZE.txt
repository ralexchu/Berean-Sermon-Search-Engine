[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (music)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Well, does God detest Africa?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   It's a stark question and it comes to us from inside the continent.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Pastor John, hello. My name is Jason from Kampala, the capital city of Uganda.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   First, thank you for your continued ministry. It's been a huge blessing in my life.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   My question is this. Does God care for Africans?
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Providence has a long track record here. Throughout history we have been a beastly,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   deplorable, enslavable race.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Constantly riddled with disease, famine, and suffering.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   How are we not to conclude that we are God's least favorite race?
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Every day is pure struggle for most Ugandans.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   I know God promises to look after all people, but it still makes me wonder
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   why does he especially seem to hate Africa so much?
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I feel a special urgency about this question.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   It would be an easy question for us to ignore, but the reason I feel a special urgency
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   is not only because it comes with such heartfelt, painful earnestness
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   about Jason's own experience and his love for his people in Uganda,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   not to mention the whole of Africa, but also because I wrote a big book on Providence.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   So I feel indebted to give some accounting for his statement,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   "Providence has a long track record here," meaning God's providence has been hard
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   on the continent of Africa. None of us can just blithely say that we believe
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   in all-wise, all-embracing, all-pervasive, all-sovereign providence of God
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   and then just walk away from such questions. That won't do. It just won't do.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   So I have four observations that I have prayed over and thought about
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   to suggest that I hope will shed some light on Jason's question,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   and his mind as he wrestles with this question there in Uganda.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   He asked, "How can we not conclude that we are God's least favorite race?"
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   What an explosive question. He's not just talking about the continent of Africa.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   He's talking about blackness. It's national, it's geographic, it's racial.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   What is God's providence in relation to these? That's his heart-agonizing question.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I doubt that he's alone in it. First, so he's four observations.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   First, I would make the absolutely crucial biblical observation
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   that all human beings everywhere in the world at all times in all history
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   are fallen, sinful, and to use the words of Ephesians 2, sons of disobedience,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   and "by nature children of wrath." Or as Romans 5.12 says,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   "Sin came into the world through one man and death through sin,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   and so death spread to all because all sinned."
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Now, in calling all human beings of every race, every nationality,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   every age, every sex, every ethnicity, in calling all human beings children of wrath,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   the Bible is teaching that every day, every day not spent in hell
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   under God's full wrath is a reprieve.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Whatever else it is by way of hardship in this world, it is a reprieve.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Full judgment on us from God for our sin is being postponed as long as we are alive.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   None of us deserves to live in the presence of God, before God, in relation to God.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   And therefore, none of us deserves to live well before God in relation to God.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Nobody anywhere in the world, no matter what their hardship, is being wronged
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   by the just and all-holy God.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And if we think, for example, that the massive infant mortality rate
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   around the world for thousands of years is an indictment of God's justice,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   it isn't, because death is a judgment on communities and families,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   as well as individuals, and all of the non-accountable infants enter into glory.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Now, in view of that universal sinfulness with all human beings being under God's
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   just condemnation, which—this is a question—which is the most disadvantageous condition
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   for such condemned people to live in?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Lives of ease as they move toward the lake of fire in the prosperous West,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   or lives of hardship as they move toward the lake of fire elsewhere?
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Which condition is designed as possibly most effective in wakening people
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   to their need for mercy and salvation?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Some nations live in comfort and prosperity while turning away from God.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Other nations live with hardship and poverty while turning away from God.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And the Bible teaches that both have a design that can lead to repentance.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Romans 2:4 speaks of kindness, God's kindness leading people to repentance,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   and Revelation 16:11 speaks of pain and disease leading people to repentance.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Shall we say that one of those designs is hateful? Hateful.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Or should we not rather, wherever we live, under whatever hardship or comfort,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   see the hand of God beckoning us to turn to him?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   That's my first observation.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   My second observation, therefore, is that I do not know whether Africa,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   all things considered, has been favored less than, say, India or the South Sea Islands
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   or the native peoples of North and South America or the Germanic hordes of Europe
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   all those thousands and thousands of years or any other place.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I don't know.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   When Paul says in Acts 14, 6-17, "In past generations, God allowed all the nations
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   to walk in their own ways, yet he did not leave himself without a witness,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   for he did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   satisfying your hearts with good and gladness."
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   I don't know if for thousands of years that was less true of Africa
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   than those other places and peoples.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   That's my second observation. I just don't know.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   It's not obvious to me.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   My third observation, God simply does not treat all individuals the same,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   nor does he treat all families the same, nor does he treat all tribes the same,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   nor does he treat all nations the same, on all continents the same,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   nor does he treat all races the same.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   It is absolutely baffling from a human standpoint to try to figure out
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   why one family seems to undergo hardship after hardship after hardship
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   while another family, perhaps totally unbelieving and irreligious,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   scarcely has any adversity at all.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I've had a dad say to me face to face after his baby died,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   "Are we under a curse, Pastor John?"
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Because this had been about the third tragedy in a row in just a few years.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I've seen it over and over again in our church and beyond.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   The wicked prosper, the righteous suffer.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   There's nothing even close to equal distribution of sorrow in this world.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   And the lesson is this.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   God's ways of accomplishing his wise and just and merciful purposes
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   are not our ways, and his thoughts are not our thoughts,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   and we better not look at such inequities and infer quickly that we know
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   what God is doing because we almost certainly don't,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   at least not in any detail.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   "How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable are his ways,"
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Romans 11:33.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Just when you think you know what providence is doing by way of judgment
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   and mercy, it can be dramatically reversed in a split second,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   and we are thrown back again and again on utter reliance upon God,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   which is one of his main designs, as Paul said in 2 Corinthians 1, 8 and 9.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Here's my last observation.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Peter says in his second letter, "Do not overlook this one fact, beloved,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   and a thousand years is as one day," 2 Peter 3:8.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   He said that to help us understand God's purposes in delaying the second coming.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   My point here is this.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Though the times of darkness may seem long, perhaps today the hour of Africa
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   has come.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   In the last century, that's one-tenth of one of those thousand-year days,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   the Christian population of Africa has grown from 10 million Christians
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   at the beginning of the 20th century, about 10% of the population,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   to close to 500 million today, professing believers.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   One scholar observes, "This past Sunday, more Anglicans attended church
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   in each of Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, than did Anglicans
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   in Britain, Canada, and Episcopalians in the United States combined."
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Wow.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Kenya has more people in Christian churches on Sunday than all of Canada.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Last Sunday, more Presbyterians were in church in Ghana than in Scotland.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   We're talking Presbyterians because it was born in Scotland.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   More Presbyterians in church in Ghana than in Scotland.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Now, here's the point.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Just when we thought we had God's providence figured out and that he was,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   say, partial to the West, he dramatically reverses course
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   and causes his church in the global South to explode.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   At the beginning of the 20th century, 71% of professing Christians
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   in the world lived in Europe.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   By the end of the 20th century, that number had shrunk from 71% to 28%.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   43% of the Christians in the world now live in Latin America and Africa.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   From that standpoint, one might be tempted to ask, "Does God hate Europe?"
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Now, I don't think that's a good question to ask.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   I hope what I've shown here is that providence is not so easily read,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   and his work of salvation is not yet complete.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   The brushstrokes on the canvas of world history will not be plain
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   until the masterpiece is finished.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Beautiful global perspective on God's grace in the canvas of world history.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   And thank you for the question, Jason, in Uganda.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   We appreciate it.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Thanks for joining us today.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   You can ask a question of your own.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   You can search our growing archive or subscribe to the podcast.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Do all of that at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Well, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Paul says that in 2 Corinthians 5:7.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   It's an amazing statement.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   In Christ we participate in the new creation right now.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   We are new creatures.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   We are regenerated.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   We have been born a second time.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   My inner man has been raised from the dead by the Spirit of Christ himself.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   So my sins are forgiven.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   I have been crucified with Christ.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives within me.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Galatians 2.20.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   There are so many glorious pictures of the Christian life.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   And yet, in spite of all these life-transforming realities, we still sin.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   We're still being duped by the world, the devil, our own remaining sinfulness within.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   So how do we reckon with our sinful failures as redeemed Christians?
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   That's up next time.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   We'll see you back here on Wednesday for that.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   See you then.
