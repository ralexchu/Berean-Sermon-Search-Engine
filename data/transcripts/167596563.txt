[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Chapter 46 and 47
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Alright, so we're looking at Chapter 46 and 47 today.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   We're actually just starting to get into the good stuff.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   And then the next session is the heavy messianic, you know, full-on...
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   You know, I kind of like the emphasis starting from the... for the next session.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Starting from, I think, Chapter 48, 49, okay?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   But I'm sure you've already noticed that that's kind of like where he's going.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   So let me pray for us and then we'll jump into the text.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for today.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   We thank you for all the mercies.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   We thank you for all the blessings that we have to be able to be in a country where we have the freedom.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   That we don't have to worry about persecution, that we may be able to live peaceful and quiet lives.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   But in the midst of all the blessings that you've given us, that we would not become complacent.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   That there would be a constant reminder, Lord God, if not physically, spiritually.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Be able to understand, Lord, that we are in the midst of spiritual battle.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   That you have a great work, Lord, that you are always doing and always have been doing.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   That we may participate in this work, that we may be able to know your heart.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   And as you pursue sinners, that you would make us people, Lord God, who join you in your work.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   So we ask for your blessing. We ask, Lord God, that you give us deeper insight into your word.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   All right, so we're in Isaiah.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   All right, so the first question that was asked was,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Bel and Nebo were Babylonian names and Babylonian idols.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   What are the two people that you thought of, either from memory or maybe you did some research,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   that has the name Bello and Nebo to begin with?
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   I think the second one is pretty obvious.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Belshizer and Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And obviously they're kind of connected.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   So when the passage begins in verse 46, it says,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   "Bel bows down, Nebo stoops. Their idols are on beasts and livestock."
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   So it is obviously in reference to the Babylonians and the idols that they worshipped.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Okay? All right.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   What are the first three verses a picture of?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   What historical activity is pictured in the first three verses of Isaiah 46?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Anybody?
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   What happens to Israel that's related to Babylon?
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Anybody?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   What do the Babylonians do when they take Israel and they conquer Israel?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   What do they do to the nation of Israel?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Yes, they sack this temple.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   But what particular event do you think this is in reference to, first seven verses?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It's like on the tip of your tongue. I can see it.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   All I have to do is push you and it's going to come out. I can see it.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Enslaved them. They take them into captivity, right?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   They take all the leaders, all the prominent people, right?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And they take them into captivity.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   So if you look at the language in verse 40, chapter 1, or 46.1,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   "They stoop down, they bow down together, they cannot save the burden,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   but they themselves go into captivity."
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   So he's talking about how they're being carried out into captivity.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   And these idols that they're taking into captivity can't save you.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   They themselves are going to go into captivity, right?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   So this is an illustration of Israel being taken into captivity
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   and the idols that Israel trusted to save them.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   So God is rebuking them saying like, "They can't even save themselves.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Why would you rely on them?"
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And so their idols have become a burden.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   All they are is a burden that needs to be carried with you.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   But in the end, all they are is a burden.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   So continue on. The second question is,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   "What contrast does God make with the idols of Babylon in verse 2?"
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   So let's look at verse 2.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   They stoop, they bow down together, they cannot save the burden,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   but they themselves go into captivity.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   But in contrast, verse 4, "Even to your old age I am He,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   and to gray hairs I will carry you.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I have made, and I will bear, and I will carry, and will save."
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   So what contrast does He make?
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   How these idols are being carried into captivity,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   but they can't carry you. You have to carry them.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   But then He says, "But I, the only God, are going to end up carrying you."
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   So again, it's meant to be a contrast with the idol
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   between the God that they serve.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   So they need to be carried, but the true God will carry them.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   So even though the rebuke is against the Babylonians,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   He is establishing again the nation of Israel,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   they were the ones who carried these idols.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Right? They carried these, these are the idols that they trusted.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Now why did the Israelites have idols, the Babylonians,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   the idols with them? And why were they, when they were taken into captivity,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   take these idols with them?
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Do you understand the question?
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   It seems like they didn't discover the idols in Babylon.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Right? Look at the language. Look at verse 2.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   All right, in verse 1, "Bellow bows down, nevel stoops,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   their idols are on beasts and livestock."
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   In other words, they're on the beasts being taken into captivity.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   These things carry, these things you carry, who are the you?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Israelites, right? These things you carry are born as burdens on weary beasts.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   So the Israelites had them.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   They're Babylonian idols, and they had them,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   and then they're going in, relying on them to deliver them.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Right? And so God is saying, all these are our burdens
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   upon the beasts that are carrying you. They have to carry these idols too.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   But why did the Israelites have the Babylonians' idols with them?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   And why were they carrying it into Babylon?
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   You understand the question?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   [inaudible]
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   So obviously they're worthless. I mean, that's established.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   They're idols, and you have to make them. Right?
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And they have no way to protect you.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   But why did the Israelites have Babylonians' idols with them?
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   And why were they carrying it into Babylon?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   [inaudible]
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Do you hear that?
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   It may be for business reasons why they did that, but again, the rebuke isn't about business.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   It's them actually worshipping these idols. Right?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   If you think about it, when we bring the Gospel to poorer areas of the world,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   a lot of times they receive the Gospel because they think that if they become Christians,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   they're going to have what we have. Money. Right?
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   So a lot of times the people are receptive, not because they believe in the Gospel itself,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   but they think that if I believe what you believe, am I going to have what you have?
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And so a lot of times the response isn't really genuine.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   And it kind of takes time. And then they realize that when they don't become rich after they become Christian,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   a lot of people end up backsliding too.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   That's something that I notice as we travel around and share the Gospel.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   A lot of times they're hoping to get rich by becoming Christians,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   because America is related to Christianity. Right?
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I think that's probably what was happening around there,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   because the Babylonians were the superpower.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   And so a lot of them who are worshipping idols, I mean they weren't just worshipping any idols,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   they're probably worshipping idols that they thought were successful.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   And who were the successful, you know, people who were successful at that time?
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   The Syrians, the Babylonians. So these idols didn't come from nowhere.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   So when they went into Canaan, what idols did they worship there?
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Asherah, Baal, because they were the ones that they worshipped.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   So these guys go in there and their crops are plenty and they're wealthy,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   and they have things that they want, so they adopt their idols, right?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   That they would worship, hoping that they can have what they have.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   So it looks like the Israelites adopted some of the idols in Babylon,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   and when they were taken into captivity, remember one of the rebukes of what God said in the previous chapter?
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   He said He brought disaster upon them, and how did they respond?
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   They didn't recognize, right? They didn't recognize that it was God.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   And they remained obstinate. So even as they're being rebuked and being taken into captivity,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   some of the Israelites were still holding on to these idols.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   And so that's what He's rebuking. But you're carrying these burdens,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   and all they are are extra burden, they can't carry you.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And so He's contrasting what they're putting their hopes in,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   but in verse 4 it says, "I am the only true God." Right?
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   So I think that's probably why they had it with them, why they're carrying it in.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Again, it's a promise God will remain with them and carry them until old age.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   He says He made, He's the one who made, He's the one who will bear,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   He's the one who will carry, and He's the one who will save.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Reminding them that all these things, like you're the one who made the idols,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   you're the one who will end up bearing them, you're the ones who will carry them,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   and then they can't save you. Right?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   So all of this stuff is in contrast to what He was saying about the idols. Right?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Again, this is the same tender care that we saw in Luke chapter 12, 6-7,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   where God describes Himself, again previously He described Himself
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   like as a caring mother, "I know you in the mother's womb." Right?
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   And here again He's describing how He tenderly cares and loves them.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Or in the passage, it says, "Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   and not one of them is forgotten before God?
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Why, even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Fear not, you are of more value than many sparrows."
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   So again, that's basically, you know, it's the same God that is caring for
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   the nation of Israel, who's promising the same care to the church.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Repeatedly, over and over again, when God calls His people to repentance,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   "Remember," He says, He keeps saying, "Remember, remember." Right?
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   What is it that He's asking them to remember?
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   And why? Why is He asking them to remember this?
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   He says to remember to be strong. Right?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   To not to be shaky.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Because the moment that they forget who it is that they worship,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   and who it is that they love, that loves them, they begin to stray.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   So, I think in the ESV, it says, "Remember to,"
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   what verse are we looking at? Verse 8.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   "Remember this and stand firm."
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   In the King James, literally it says, "Remember and be a man." Right?
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   That's probably more convicting for men. Right? Be a man. Right?
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   If you want to be a man, remember who God is that you worship.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Remember that God is the only God. He alone controls human history.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   So He goes, again, you know, "Remember the former things of old,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   for I am God and there is no other. I am God and there is none like me.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Declaring the end from the beginning and from the ancient times things not yet done.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Saying, 'My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose.'"
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   So when He says, "My counsel shall stand," right,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   what do you think that's in reference to?
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   The covenant that He made with Israel. Right?
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   And how He's been faithful all throughout,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   even in the midst of their rebellion and sinfulness, God is faithful to who?
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   To Himself. To Hisself and His promises. Right?
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   His faithfulness is not based upon them.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   His faithfulness was based upon the unilateral covenant that He makes with the nation of Israel.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   And so He says, "Remember." Right?
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   You guys keep going to these idols thinking that if you worship their idols
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   that you're going to get what they have.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   And then what's going to happen to these people that you envy?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   That you think that somehow if you worship their idols you're going to become like the Babylonians.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   What does He say? Right?
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   All these things that you envy in Babylon are going to come to nothing.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   They're all going to be burned up too. They're all going to come under judgment. Right?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   So He keeps telling them, "Even though you may not see for the moment with your eyes what God is doing,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   but remember who He is. Remember that He's the God of the covenant." Right?
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   How is He going to do this? He said He's going to raise up the bird of prey from the east.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   And who is that in reference to? Cyrus.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Okay, and we talked about that last week. Cyrus.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   And how many years before Cyrus shows up and fulfills this prophecy,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   when this is being written?
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   About 200 years. 150 to 200 years. Right?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   So He said, "Cyrus is going to be raised up and He's going to deliver you from the Babylonians
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   and they're going to be crushed by My servant, King Cyrus." Right?
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   And He says, "Even this great king of Persia is ultimately under His control."
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Which again, 200 years prior to it happening, it would have sounded ridiculous.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Right? God's going to raise up Persia, the most powerful nation at that particular time,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   all for the purpose of delivering this insignificant group of people. Right?
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   And then when it happens, is the whole nation returned?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Very small percentage, maybe like 5% of the people who will go into captivity end up returning.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Right? Very small percent of them.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   So if you heard it at that time thinking, "Wait a minute, God's going to raise up Persia
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   to deliver us from them?" It would have sounded ridiculous if it didn't actually happen.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Right? It actually happens exactly like God says.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And in retrospect, we look back at it now, right?
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   His whole human history was for the purpose of coming of Christ.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   So God was doing something much bigger than Persia.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Much bigger than Assyria.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   But at that time, it would have sounded ridiculous. Right?
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   What could be greater than Persia? What could be greater than Assyria?
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   What could be greater than Egypt? Right?
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Coming of the Son of God.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   So all of this, He's going to be faithful to these few, few people.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Right? Because His plan was to bring His Son through those people to save the world.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   It wasn't just about Assyria. It wasn't just about that area. Right?
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   And He promises them, verse 12 and 13, He says, "Listen to me, you stubborn heart,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   you who are far from righteousness." Again, He's talking to Israel. Right?
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   In other words, He said, "I'm being faithful to you, not because you're righteous."
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   He said, "You're stubborn of heart, and righteousness is far from you,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   but I bring near My righteousness, and it is not far off.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   And My salvation will not delay.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   And I will put salvation in Zion for Israel, My glory."
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   In other words, what is He saying? You're not going to deserve any of this. Right?
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   The salvation that's going to come isn't something you're going to earn. Right?
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Because you are—righteousness is far from you. Right?
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Now we obviously, in retrospect, we look back at it, and say,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   He's clearly talking about Christ, and what He was going to do.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Yeah. So I don't know about you, but when you take a step back,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   and you really let it sink in, what Isaiah is saying,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   and what God is doing in the midst of history, you know, like,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   I think we get into so much problem, and we create so many problems,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   because we have a natural, like, default setting, where we're the center.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   When, like, what is God doing, like, with me?
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   You know what I mean? Like, what is God's will for my life?
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Do you know what I'm saying? And we get so caught up in trying to figure that out,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   and trying to adjust all of these things.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Like, what is God doing with me?
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Not recognizing, like, this is what God's been doing in history.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   This is what God is doing now, and this is what God will continue to do.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   So the right question really should be, what am I doing, right?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   How does my life fit into this, right?
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   If this is what God's doing, if this is, He's orchestrating the raising up of nations,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   orchestrating kings, and rulers, and politicians, right?
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   He's orchestrating all of this for the purpose of salvation of mankind.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   And this is how He's always been doing.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   This is why Christ came. This is why He established the church, right?
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   And this is what He's trying to accomplish in our lives, right?
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   So I think a lot of the times the frustration and confusion comes because we separate God's will,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   and then His will for me and my life, and then somehow, like, it's not connected.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   You know? But I don't know about you, but, you know, this is a reminder to me,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   like, we're a small part of this big picture of what God is doing, right?
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   What will He do to the pride of Babylon?
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   I said, you know, Israelites, He's going to be faithful to them.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   He raises up Babylon for the purpose of judgment.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   But because the Babylonians thought, you know, of course, you know, like, we did it.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   It's because we were smart, because we were powerful.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   God's going to judge you for your pride, right?
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   God will humble Babylon of its pride and strip away their throne.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   So if you look at chapter 47, verse 1, "Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon."
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Sit on the ground without a throne.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   What image do you get when He's saying, "Sit on the ground"?
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   He's being humbled.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Like somebody sitting on the throne, instead of sitting on the throne, He said, "You're going to sit in the dust."
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   "For you shall no more be called tender and delicate."
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Why does He use that imagery of tender and delicate?
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Young and naive, possibly.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   If you notice, as you're reading 47, does He use a feminine description or a masculine description?
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   It's very feminine.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Like "mistress," right?
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   There's other stuff.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Hmm?
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Yeah, daughter. Anyway, I'm not going to go through all this.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Like, "Strip off your robe, uncover your legs, pass through the rivers, and then your nakedness shall be uncovered."
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   So all of this stuff that He talks about, it's a female imagery.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Why does God use a female imagery to describe the shame that's going to come upon Babylon?
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Why do you think?
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Because you would think a mighty nation like Babylon, you would say, you know, you think you're a mighty warrior, you know what I mean?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   The lion is going to be turned into a little pipsqueak or whatever.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   But He describes it as a delicate mistress or female.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Right?
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   I don't know if I should kind of demystify the Babylonian mighty country.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Like, it's really this delicate, you know, like you're saying, it's delicate, but it's something that's more...
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   It's not this, like, giant brick, it's something very soft and delicate and more vulnerable than what, like, nobody can stop.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Babylonians are like, no, it's this vulnerable thing that's going to be ashamed of.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   And become as...
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Curious.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   In the other Pineso, Cyrus later, both had multiple places where it was described, because they had a knowledge of God.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   They had some sort of unique, very interesting relationship with God.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And like you were saying earlier, that God was up to a plan much bigger than the nations themselves.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   He wasn't just using them, He was actively imparting them with blessing, knowledge, wisdom, discernment.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   So, not just so they can become powerful, but also because of God's care for them.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   God seems to show affectionate care for the Babylonians and the...
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   I think the Persians will come later.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Much more so that I think you can see with anything like Canaan or the other nations that just got wiped out.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   He was very interested in them becoming...
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Following in His will.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   So He had not just a plan for them, but a plan for blessing and good for them as well.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Maybe not like covenantally with Israel, but there's definitely a lot of care and investment
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   through the kings of these nations, the northern nations.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Okay.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Yeah, I mean, they're definitely unlike the Assyrians where God actually is actively raising them and using them.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Think about the historical context of the Babylonians.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Who came before the Babylonians?
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Remember when it's the judgment against Assyria? Remember how that's described?
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   How is Assyria described?
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Your captains, your swords, your brutality.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   And what you would expect because what the Assyrians were known for.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   What were the Babylonians known for?
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   Art, culture.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   So it was almost like they were afraid of the Assyrians because of their brutality.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   Where Babylonians...
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   What was the stumbling block with the Babylonians?
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Hmm?
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Intelligence, education, wealth.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   They were attracted.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Why do you think they had their idols?
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Right?
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   The Assyrians wanted to inflict fear where the Babylonians were kind of like attracting the world to them.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   So in the New Testament and in the Book of Revelation, whenever it talks about the world as Babylon,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   what is it in reference to?
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Like the world's attraction, the temptation of the world.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Right? Where people are like, "I want to be like the Babylonians."
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   So I think, again, I think the reason why the feminine description is given is because the Babylonians were not known for brutality.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   In fact, they were tempted. They want to be like the Babylonians. Right?
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   So when God gives opportunity for them to return, right?
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   The majority of the people in Babylon assimilated into the Babylonian culture.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   They didn't want to return.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Even when the Persians came, they got pretty comfortable where they were.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Right?
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   When the Assyrians took over, I mean, if they got free from the Assyrians, it meant freedom from oppression.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Right?
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   From fear.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   But when they got freed from the Babylonians and the Persians, a lot of them didn't want to be free.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   They got very comfortable.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   In fact, going back to Jerusalem would have been risking their life.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   They would have been—a lot of them got pretty comfortable there.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   And there's a reason why the Bible describes the world as Babylon.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Because of the lure, the temptation.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   So again, again, you notice the subtle difference between how Assyria is described and Babylon is described.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   And out of the two, which had a greater impact on Israel?
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Which had a greater corrupting influence on Israel?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   It was Babylon.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   Right?
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   The Babylonians, their culture and their temptation had a much greater impact.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   Right?
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   So if you look at Satan's work, is persecution what kills the Church?
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   No.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   If you go to anywhere where you hear persecution, you almost always—they tell you it purifies the Church.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   The Church actually becomes stronger as a result of persecution.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   What kills the Church is wealth.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Right?
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   And comfort and ease.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Temptation.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   That's what kills the Church.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   Right?
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   So the lure of the Babylonians, the temptation of what the Babylonians were offering, was much more devastating to Israel than the Assyrians.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Right?
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   He says, "He will take vengeance on them because of their pride, thinking that somehow by their own effort, it's like, 'You were only strong because I allowed you to be.'"
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Like it says in Romans 13.1.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Again, Babylon is described as a woman who falls from a lofty position and will no longer be considered tender and delicate.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   And she is called a mistress.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   Why do you think Babylon is described as a mistress?
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Right, you have a relationship, but it's not legal.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Right?
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   It's not sanctioned by God.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   She's acting like your wife, but she's not.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   Right?
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   So Israel is tied to her.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   You know, it's almost like acting like they're married, and she's a mistress.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Right?
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   So it's a mistress, not with God, but it's a mistress with Israel.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Why did God allow Babylon to become mighty and oppress Israel?
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   According to verse 6.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   God gave his people over to Babylonians because of the sins of Israel.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Not because Babylon was great, but because the sin of Israel was great.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   He was trying to discipline them.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   So even though God handed them over, but because they treated the Israelites mercilessly, meaning they took them into captivity, right?
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   God will treat them mercilessly.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Again, the only reason why God's people are conquered is because God allows it.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Again, in James 4, 7, remember this passage.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   "Submit yourself therefore to God, resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   And it's always in that order.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   The only reason why the world has any foothold is because we allow it because of sin.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Right?
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   It's because anytime Israel strayed from God, they became weak.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   It wasn't because of the great power of the Babylonians.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   It was because God withdrew.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Right?
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   God withdrew from the nation, or Israel withdrew from God.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   And that's exactly what it says in Revelations, right?
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Revelation chapter 2.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   "If you do not restore your first love, I will take away my lampstand."
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   And lampstand is his church and his presence.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   In other words, he's saying that if you remain lukewarm, right?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   And your worship is all it is, is physical activity, and you're doing the right things,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   and you have forsaken your first love, he said, "I will take away your lampstand."
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   In other words, the presence of God is withdrawn.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Right?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   And then the church becomes worthless, like salt without flavor.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Right?
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   A lot of man's work, but no fruit.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   [Pause]
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   How is Babylon's sins, like how is it described?
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Again, they're described as mistress.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   [Pause]
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   And then their pride.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   And so, there are about five or six things that are described,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   like how pride was manifested in Babylon.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Okay, so I'm going to put it up here.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   And I want you to think for a minute, in what way does pride manifest itself
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   in loving pleasure, and feeling secure, and control of destiny, right?
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   Feeling secure in wickedness, and relying on their wisdom and knowledge.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Right?
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   These are all fruits that God describes of pride.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Right?
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   What does pride and loving pleasure have to do with it?
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   How are these connected?
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   [Pause]
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   How does loving pleasure…
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Why is that a manifestation of pride of Babylon?
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   [Pause]
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Self-seeking?
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Okay, self-seeking.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   I mean, self-seeking, self-worship, self-centered, maybe?
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Right?
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Instead of serving God, you serve yourself.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   Sitting securely.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   You know, they have all that power, they've conquered everybody,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   so they feel secure, right?
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   I can do it.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   Right?
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   [Pause]
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Like you just…
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   You know, that pride manifests when you think, like,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   "Oh, whatever problems, I can handle it."
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Sometimes God will allow you to experience things
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   where you become so desperate, you feel lost,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   and maybe even shaken in your faith, right?
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   So that you would recognize…
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   So you and I would recognize how helpless we are without His grace, right?
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   Because I think the most dangerous place for any Christian to be
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   is self-confidence and self-reliance, right?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   Because of our experience, maybe because of the past fruit,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   maybe because we're so smart.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   You know, I remember doing quiet time years ago,
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   when after the resurrection, Jesus meets the disciples,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   and He tells the disciples to put the net into the water.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   And remember what they say?
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   And they say, "We've been fishing all night, we didn't catch anything."
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   In other words, we're professional fishermen,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   and we've been fishing all night when you're supposed to fish, right?
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Where the water is cool and there's fish come up.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   You're telling us to put a net in, you a carpenter, right?
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   Telling us professional fishermen who couldn't catch anything all night,
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   and you just want us to throw a net out there, and then all of a sudden…
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   But He said, "Because you said it, I'll do it."
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   And they put a net in, and then obviously they catch so much fish,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   they actually counted, right?
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Probably Matthew, the tax collector, probably sat there and counted all this fish, right?
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   And then, they say, "Wow!" and they overflow, and they recognize,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   "Wow, Jesus, they come and they have breakfast with Him."
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   And I remember thinking that when I was doing quiet time through that,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   thinking, "It's usually the areas that we're successful in,
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   where we are the weakest in, because we're good at it."
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Right? We're good at it.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   So if you're an accountant, you tend to be less reliant upon God with money,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   because you're good with money.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   If you're good with people,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   you tend to be more self-reliant when it comes to people,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   because you're good with people.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   Right?
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   So it's in the areas that you may be gifted in,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   where you probably are the weakest, and you don't know it.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   That's our greatest blind spot.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Our greatest blind spot in our faith is the areas where you may be…
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   you may be the best at doing, humanly speaking.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   But in reality, spiritually, that's where you're the weakest.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Right?
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   That's how pride manifests.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   Whatever we think we're good at is usually probably where you're the weakest.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   Right?
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   I think about Apostle Paul.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   He probably lived all his life, never made a single tent in his life,
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   until he became a Christian.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   His dad was a Roman citizen.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   I mean, this guy was wealthy.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   Imagine how much money he needed to have to be able to hire Gamaliel as your teacher.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Greatest scholar.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   That's just like saying, "Oh, I need to be tutored."
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   And you find the chancellor for Harvard to come to your house and tutor you.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   That was Paul.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Paul had Gamaliel as his discipler.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   But you had to be filthy, wealthy.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Right?
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Filthy wealthy.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Wealthy 50.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Right?
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   I'll bet you he had one of those soft, lotioned hands all his life,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   until he became a Christian, and then he started making tents.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   That's my guess.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Right?
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   He didn't really experience hardship until he met Christ.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   And why did he do that?
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Jesus could get gold coins out of fish's mouths.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Why does he make his personally picked apostle make tents for a living?
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Right?
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Probably to humble him.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   Right?
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Because once pride gets in, you're ruined.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   You're ruined.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   So you look at all these descriptions, like, "These are all manifestations."
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   Right?
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   "You feel powerful. You have control over your destiny."
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   Like, "If I apply myself, I've been successful here."
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   You know?
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   And so God will humble you.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   "You're feeling secure in your wickedness."
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Why not?
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Because you've sinned and you've been successful.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   Right?
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   You haven't been praying, but everything in your life is going okay.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Right?
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   And that's when danger comes.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Right?
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Because that's what happened in Babylon.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   I mean, they weren't worshiping God.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   They were arrogant.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   And these people that supposedly worshiped the right God, and we conquered them.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Right?
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   So they think they can get away with it.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   And God said, "God's going to humble all of them."
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   They're relying on their wisdom, their knowledge.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Right?
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Because it was because of their wisdom and their knowledge why the Babylonians became what they were.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   So that's what they were relying on until God humbles them.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   And then they're going to come back and re-question, "Maybe it wasn't our knowledge.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   Maybe it wasn't our wisdom."
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   Right?
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   So again, if God is concerned about us and he counts every hair on our head,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   what is it that he is the most concerned about in our life?
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Not your hair.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   He's expressing that he cares to that extent.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   But what is it that he cares the most?
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Right?
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   It's you.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Because the moment you are filled with pride, you are the furthest from him.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   Right?
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   So anything that causes you to think that you can do it, that's probably what he's the most concerned about.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Because that's what's going to keep you away from God.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   So don't you think when the Bible says that God opposes the proud and gives grace to the humble,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   that God is actively pursuing to humble you and humble me?
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   Because that's the thing that he's most concerned about.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   That you strain away thinking that you're not going to need him.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   Right?
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   That's why if we don't buffet our bodies and make it our slave to humble,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   like deliberately, actively, proactively humble ourselves,
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   we're almost asking for it.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   Right?
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   Because that's what God cares about us so much, he's not going to let us stray.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   If we're his children, he's going to discipline us to humble us.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   Right?
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   What judgment is going to come upon them?
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   Now why does he say they're going to experience losing a child and becoming a widower?
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   Why does he say that? It's so specific.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   What do you think this is in relation to?
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   They did this to Israel. Remember?
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   When they took them into captivity, they took their children, they took their husbands,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   whatever was the choices of the land, they took them into Babylon.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   Right?
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   So again, the judgment against them is you did this to my people and this is going to happen to you.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   Right? You think that you are safe when you did this to my people?
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   Right? This is what's going to happen to you.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   You're going to experience the pain that you've inflicted on my people.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Right?
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Again, I forgot to blot this out.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   Did I blot it out in your... I didn't, right?
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   I forgot to erase it.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   So again, the principle over and over again, God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   That's the whole theme, right, of his judgment.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   What is God mocking in 12 and 13?
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   Again, the mocking of false idols that people relied on.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   And that this was so... when it says that these are the idols that you relied upon your youth,
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   meaning it was deeply embedded in Israel.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   Right?
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   These were not some superficial stuff.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   These were things that they worshipped and relied on since they were young.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   Right?
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Again, what will happen to these false idols?
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   It says they will be burned like stubble and will become completely useless.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   Okay.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Alright, so if you go back to... and I'm trying to give you some application questions or discussion questions at the end of each day.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   So you guys can go back and look at the discussion questions and maybe take some time to discuss that or some of the things that we went over today.
