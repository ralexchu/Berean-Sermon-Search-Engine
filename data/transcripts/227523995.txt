[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720]   Alright, so today's goal is threefold.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.720]   We're going to be looking at chapter 1 through 11.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.680]   One is to, so that at the end of the Bible study or end of the review, that you will
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.880]   understand the major theme of chapters 1 through 11.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.800]   So that's one of our goals.
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.780]   Two, that you'll have a general flow of the book.
[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.080]   So if we say, you know, what's happening and what event takes place after what, that you
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.080]   understand.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.880]   So in order to do that, at least have some general knowledge.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.440]   You don't have to have specific knowledge of every single judgment that is mentioned
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.280]   in Revelation, but hopefully you'll be able to distinguish between the third trumpet and
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.120]   the first trumpet.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.960]   And the first seal and the last seal.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.720]   At least kind of general flow.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.720]   And the third goal is I want you to be specific enough.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.720]   So if I said chapter 3, that you know what is contained in chapter 3.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.900]   If I say chapter 11, you know what's contained in chapter 11.
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.600]   So if you're able to know the major theme, know the general flow of the book and be able
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.000]   to say from memory what's happening in each of these books, that by the time we get to
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.320]   chapter 12, you'll be much better prepared.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.760]   That we're going to be jumping on top of this.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.120]   But if you don't get that, you know, obviously we're going to keep adding to this the different
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.520]   judgments and then it's just going to, all the judgments are going to start to sound
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.720]   jumbled together.
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.720]   Okay.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.480]   So let me pray for us and then we'll jump in.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:40.120]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for this evening and allowing our church to come together and
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.800]   study your word.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.160]   We pray that the things that we've already studied that you bring to memory and more
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.360]   than just our mind, that it would convict our hearts and move us, Lord God, toward our
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.400]   will and our lives.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.480]   So we pray Father that your word would bear fruit and what you have intended that it would
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.480]   happen in us.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.480]   We thank you Jesus and we pray.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.480]   Amen.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.480]   All right.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.960]   So before we get in, I want to get into the introduction of the book like we did last
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.080]   time, the purpose of the revelation.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.560]   Okay.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.200]   He says in verse three, so what I encourage you to do, whether it's your laptop or your
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.360]   phone or if it's a physical Bible, to open it up to revelation because we're going to
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.600]   be skipping through all 11 chapters.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.600]   Okay.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.120]   And at the second part of it, I'm going to ask you to put it away so hopefully you can
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.640]   remember it, but this part you can have it open.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.640]   Okay.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.720]   So the purpose of the revelation in chapter one, verse three says, "Blessed is the one
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.080]   who reads aloud the words of this prophecy and blessed are those who hear and who keep
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.560]   what is written in it for the time is near."
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.320]   So there's three things that he mentions, right?
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.400]   To read it, to hear it, and then to keep it.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.920]   And this is true, obviously, in everything that we study in the Bible, that we would
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.360]   first listen, right?
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.600]   That you would listen to the teaching, that you would listen to the reading, you would,
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.840]   you would, oh, sorry, you would read it for yourself and then you would hear the teaching.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.720]   But ultimately, what does this mean for you?
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.320]   God didn't reveal the revelation, book of revelations, so that you can just say, "Oh,
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.160]   okay, you know, this is what God says about the end times."
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.960]   The purpose of it is, what is the application behind this?
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.640]   What was God's intent?
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.200]   How was God trying to move the early church through this writing, right?
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.320]   It wasn't simply to inform.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.920]   It was to inform in order to be transformed.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:46.280]   So where does the transformation take place in our lives, right?
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.800]   In 1 Thessalonians 4, 2 through 5, we are warned and encouraged and told that, "For
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.720]   you yourselves are fully aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.680]   night while people are saying there's peace and security, then sudden destruction will
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.360]   come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman and they will not escape.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.440]   But you are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief."
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.520]   So the book of Revelation, who was it written for in the early church?
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.440]   What kind of context were they in, the early church, that received this letter?
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.040]   What was the political spiritual environment?
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.540]   There's heavy persecution, right?
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.480]   We're going to talk about that in a little bit.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:38.000]   Where are the seven churches that he writes this letter to?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.360]   What does that region call?
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.720]   Asia Minor.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.920]   So some of you guys might remember when we were studying the book of Acts, remember Apostle
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.400]   Paul when he was making his second missionary journey?
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.320]   He comes to Asia Minor.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.920]   What does God tell him not to do?
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.280]   The Holy Spirit tells him not to go into Asia Minor, right?
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.000]   And then he goes up to Bithynia, and then while he's up at Bithynia, there's a dream
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.320]   that tells him to come over to Philippi.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.240]   And so the Holy Spirit deliberately keeps him from Asia Minor, and during that period
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.000]   we find out there was intense persecution happening in Asia Minor.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.200]   So it was kind of where Apostle Paul, it was not a right time for him to be in that area.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.800]   So this area where the seven churches, where the revelation was written for, was undergoing
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.640]   intense persecution.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:36.600]   So what effect would this have, this revelation have to these churches?
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.360]   Encouragement, right?
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.000]   Somebody's in intense suffering, saying, "No, Jesus is coming," right?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.120]   To hold on, to cause them to persevere, to give them hope that the final outcome isn't
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.800]   going to be their destruction.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.880]   The final outcome is going to be victory in Christ, even unto death.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.480]   Even if you die, Christ is going to be victorious.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.440]   And then there's parts of it where it says they're crying out to God, right?
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.440]   There's martyrs who are crying out to God, and God says He will not delay.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.160]   So those who are the ones who are persecuting and causing harm, that God's going to take
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.840]   vengeance on them as well.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.160]   So he's writing this letter as a source of encouragement, perseverance, to strengthen
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.040]   them, empower them, give them hope.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.920]   So there's a very practical application to everything that he's saying.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.960]   He's not simply tickling the church's ears.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.040]   You know, I know some of you guys are really curious what's going to happen at the end,
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.560]   so let me just give you a hint of what's going to happen.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:40.000]   Obviously there is that effect on us, but there's a very practical effect on the church,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   right?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.420]   To keep them sober, to persevere, even unto death, for them basically not to quit, right?
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:53.560]   So having said that, even though we may not be experiencing intense persecution as Christians,
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:00.500]   at least in this period, it is meant to sober us, to let us know that this is not just some
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.500]   statement of theology, that this is what is going to happen.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.900]   And so if we believe this, how does it affect the Christian?
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.180]   Knowing that the world is going to come to an end at some point, right?
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.020]   Knowing that judgment is coming.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.100]   How does that cause us to live, right?
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.420]   And then I think one of the questions that I asked you in the beginning was, if you knew
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.180]   that Christ was going to come, you know, soon, tomorrow, next month, or next year, what is
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.100]   the first thing that you would do?
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.100]   And I think universally, everybody said, we think about who to share the gospel with,
[00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.740]   try to save as many people as we can.
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.380]   And I think that's the effect that it ought to have on us when we consider and think about
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.380]   the end times.
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.020]   It gives us hope to persevere.
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.620]   It gives us courage to live a life worthy of the gospel.
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.420]   And then it gives us a sense of urgency to preach the gospel, right?
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:57.900]   So the goal of our study, again, as an introduction, is to read, to hear, and to keep, right?
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.820]   And that's no different for us.
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.740]   And again, in Revelation 16, 15, it says the same thing.
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.540]   "Behold, I am coming like a thief.
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.740]   Blessed is the one who stays away, keeping his garments on, that he may not go about
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.420]   naked and be seen exposed."
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.180]   In other words, it's a challenge for the church to stay awake, right?
[00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.580]   Not to be caught off guard when he comes.
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.300]   Like, oh my gosh, I wasn't thinking about his coming at all.
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.300]   And all of a sudden, he comes.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.460]   And everything that we're pursuing, right, was for nothing.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:30.500]   So don't live as if we're part of the world, right?
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.500]   This is really important.
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.020]   I mentioned this before.
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.140]   And if you've never heard this before, it's probably, I'm assuming a lot of it went over
[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.140]   your head.
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.040]   But whatever commentaries, maybe some of you guys have studied Bibles.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.840]   Maybe you have a Reformation study Bible or John MacArthur study Bible.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.160]   Whatever study Bible you have, they have a bent toward how they interpret the book of
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.940]   Revelation, right?
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:57.180]   And there's four major bents that we cover, right?
[00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.900]   One is called the predatorist contemporary historical approach.
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.560]   Basically this approach, again, we went over this before.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.340]   This is just for review.
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.820]   Predatorist approach basically is they believe that all that is prophesied in the book of
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:16.180]   Revelation was fulfilled in the first century, right?
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.100]   They believe that everything happened already.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.860]   So we're looking at past history.
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:25.140]   And so when they study the book of Revelation, they're going to find an anti-Christ is Nero,
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.140]   right?
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.380]   Or Israel is the church.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.580]   Or they'll try to find a first century application for all of it.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:36.700]   And so what we get out of it is principles, right?
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.900]   Just like we studied the Old Testament, what happened to the nation of Israel, they didn't
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.020]   obey God and then they went into captivity.
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.180]   So that's how they study the book of Revelation.
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.600]   These are the past events.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.500]   That's not our approach, obviously.
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.620]   Hopefully you've caught that.
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.920]   But that's the first approach.
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.000]   The second approach is a historical approach.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.140]   The historical approach in comparison to the predatorist, the difference is the predatorist
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.340]   believe that everything happened in the first century.
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:10.380]   The historical approach is that things have been unraveling throughout history.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:16.500]   So instead of saying Nero is the anti-Christ, they may say some world leader is an anti-Christ.
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.580]   Meaning maybe there was a period when the Catholic church was really corrupt and the
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.980]   Pope was the anti-Christ.
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.660]   Or maybe Hitler was the anti-Christ.
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:32.300]   So the application, so the historical view and the predatorist view is similar, except
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.940]   the predatorists find the application all in the first century.
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.820]   Where the historical view will find that it's unraveling throughout history.
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:45.940]   So I remember a long time ago, people who didn't like Ronald Reagan, they were trying
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:51.160]   to put his number together and say his number somehow, his name somehow spelled out the
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.820]   number 666 and there was a bunch of people going around saying he's anti-Christ or whatever.
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.700]   They just didn't like his politics.
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.860]   So those are the historical views.
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.460]   Whenever you see people saying that that's anti-Christ, this is anti-Christ, historically,
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.460]   throughout history.
[00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:09.220]   Okay, and obviously that's not our approach.
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.220]   Our approach is a futurist.
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:15.940]   Okay, not completely, but futurist.
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:23.380]   Futurist basically is that, I think I shared with you, whenever you study prophecy, there's
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.620]   three applications.
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.340]   First application is the historical setting.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:34.100]   So when John is writing or this letter is being written to the seven churches, there
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.300]   are actual seven churches.
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.420]   There is a church of Ephesus, there's church of Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Laodicea, all
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.160]   these churches actually exist.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.900]   And so the problem that he is addressing is an actual problem that he's addressing at
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.740]   that time.
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.340]   So there's, and same thing with Isaiah, when Isaiah prophesies about the Babylonians and
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:58.940]   coming and taking them to captivity, there is a historical application to what he's saying.
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.540]   He's saying things that apply to them.
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:08.100]   And then the second application is when Christ comes, he fulfills, again, the second portion
[00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:14.180]   of that, because Christ comes and he fulfills the prophecies partially, not completely.
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.900]   So just like our salvation, we are saved, but we are being saved.
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.180]   We're not completely saved yet.
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.900]   We're not glorified yet.
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.320]   So we're in that process.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.740]   So Christ begins the end times.
[00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.700]   We're in the last days.
[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:33.580]   So Christ started it, but the ultimate fulfillment is at the very end, when Christ comes at the
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.380]   very end, in the day of the Lord.
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.380]   So there's three applications.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:43.820]   There's this historical event that's taking place, there is a fulfillment in Christ, and
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.980]   then there is the future when he comes a second time.
[00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.740]   And so that's when we talk about the end times.
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:57.060]   So the whole period from Christ to the end is considered generally the end times.
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:01.780]   But specific application of the end times that we're talking about is the very end,
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.540]   talking about the tribulation during the time of millennium, the right throne judgment at
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.100]   the very end.
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:12.700]   So we believe that, again, the way that we're interpreting this is that there's a future
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:18.380]   event that's going to take place with the tribulation and the rapture and the millennium.
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:24.020]   And so that's basically what the, not completely futurist, but that's probably the closest
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:28.500]   thing that will, you know, the things that at least I've been talking about related to
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.940]   this.
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.100]   And then you have the idealist approach.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:39.060]   Idealist approach basically is none of this is meant to be interpreted literally.
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.220]   It's just ideological.
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.100]   So you're supposed to allegorize everything.
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.780]   There's no historical application.
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.380]   There's no actual interpreting of this.
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:51.340]   So, you know, a thousand represents something, you know, 144,000 represents something else.
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.900]   So they're always looking for hidden meaning, right?
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.160]   They're looking for allegorical, right?
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.720]   So these are the four major approaches.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:04.700]   The reason why it's important for you to know this is because if you study the book of Revelation,
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:09.120]   no matter who you're studying, they're going to have one of these bents, right?
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.020]   So if you read a passage and say, "Hey, we studied this, but then this commentary says
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:21.260]   this," it's because they're bent on one of these things, okay?
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.260]   Obviously we're going through the...
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:27.660]   I don't know if you can see this.
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.060]   Okay.
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.060]   Can you see the letters?
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.580]   Yes?
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:39.580]   All right, let me tell you what it is.
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:45.820]   It says, "Post-tribulational premillennialism."
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.620]   Can you read that?
[00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.420]   You can't read it?
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.420]   You can read it.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:58.260]   How come she's sitting way back there, she can read it?
[00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.500]   Huh?
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.980]   Oh, you can't see the smaller stuff.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.060]   I can't see that either.
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.340]   Yeah, that's actually blurred.
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.300]   So all I want you to do is pay attention to the big picture.
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:21.540]   The post-trib, tribulational premillennialism, this is the timeline that I think I lean toward.
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:25.900]   And so as I'm studying it, and that's kind of like what I'm kind of suggesting to you
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.500]   because this is what I see.
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.780]   So millennium, we're going to get to that in Revelation chapter 21, where all of this
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:39.100]   stuff that we're talking about, when all the judgments, when the seal judgment, the
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:46.180]   trumpet judgment, the bowl judgment ends, at the end, there's a rapture, there is a
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.700]   Armageddon that takes place right here, and then we all enter the thousand-year reign
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.700]   of Christ.
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:51.700]   Right?
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:56.340]   Now, whether that's going to be a literal thousand years or not, but where Christ comes
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:02.940]   and He establishes His earthly kingdom through the nation of Israel for a thousand years.
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.360]   Again, whether it's literal thousand years, I'm not sure.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:11.760]   But at the end of it, there's a white throne judgment, great white throne judgment, where
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:19.880]   all the world will have final judgment, the final judgment, and then we enter into eternity.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.900]   So that's the timeline of the end times.
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:26.940]   Now I'm not going to go through all of it, but pre-tribulational dispensation, pre-millennialism
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:32.860]   is basically Christ is going to come here, we get raptured here, the church is saved
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.540]   from this, all this, you know, the judgments that we've been talking about, the church
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:43.340]   has already been delivered, and then afterwards they come back down and then enter the millennium.
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.220]   So this part is the same as up here.
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.460]   Okay?
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.500]   So the only difference between these two is when does Christ come?
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:55.580]   Does He come in the beginning of the tribulation or at the end of the tribulation?
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:17:01.180]   And then post-millennialism, again, I'm not going to get too much into that.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:05.580]   Post-millennialism and amillennialism is, I'm not going to get too much into that, but
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:11.820]   basically when we go back to the first couple approaches.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:14.280]   So I just wanted to show you the first two.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.380]   So this is the timeline that we're going off of.
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:23.100]   All right.
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.380]   So just keep that in mind.
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:32.420]   So what are the four different approaches?
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:36.660]   I want to see your lips moving so I can see at least a portion of you.
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:37.660]   Got it.
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.660]   What's the first view?
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:39.660]   Preterist.
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.460]   And what does a preterist believe?
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.460]   First century.
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.460]   It was fulfilled in the first century.
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.460]   What's the second view?
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.460]   Historical.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.460]   And what do they believe?
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:54.060]   Fulfilled throughout history, and it's not limited to first century.
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.060]   And what's the third view?
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.100]   Futurist view.
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:02.060]   That there is going to be a future time when this is going to be fulfilled.
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.660]   And then what is the last one?
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:10.900]   Ideological view, or you can call it an allegorical view where everything is symbolic of something.
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.800]   All right.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:21.020]   So from here, what I'm going to do is on your paper, I just left blank chapter 1 through
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.020]   11.
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.060]   So what I want you to do is as we're going over it, as we're reviewing it, just fill
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.840]   in the blanks there.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.600]   Just take the notes that you want to take.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.260]   So later on, what I'm going to do is I'm going to say chapter 2.
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:40.660]   So our goal is so that you wouldn't have to look at it, that you would say, oh, chapter
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.220]   2, this was going on.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:46.940]   So chapter 1, just looking at the picture, just from memory, what do you remember about
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.260]   chapter 1?
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:19:00.820]   Obviously, it's the introduction.
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:05.740]   That description, a student right there, that's basically what happens, right?
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:10.840]   So the book begins by introducing Christ, right?
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:15.380]   John is the first vision that he sees is a vision of who Christ is.
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.060]   He's the Alpha and Omega.
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:24.060]   He has the sword of the mouth and flaming eyes, and he's standing between the seven
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.400]   lampstand.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:31.300]   And so John gets a glimpse of the glory of Jesus, and he falls down, kind of like Ezekiel
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.020]   and Isaiah.
[00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.780]   And that's the beginning.
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:47.720]   So Christ himself reveals himself.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:20:04.020]   Okay, so in chapter 1, Christ is shown.
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:09.780]   Who are the seven lampstands?
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.780]   Seven churches.
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:15.500]   So Jesus is described as standing in the midst of the seven lampstands.
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:25.740]   So what does that imagery teach us?
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.900]   I think I was talking to somebody else before, but like Book of Revelation is, studying Book
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.760]   of Revelation is like studying painting, right?
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.540]   We don't analyze like every single word of what it means.
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:42.180]   It's kind of, we're shown a picture, and basically from that picture, we're supposed to understand
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.280]   what is the intent, right?
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.640]   So one of the pictures that we see is we see a vision of Christ, and every character that
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.980]   is mentioned about Christ, where does this come back out?
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.960]   Do you guys remember?
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.460]   It's related to the seven churches.
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.780]   Do you remember?
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:07.240]   Every one of these seven churches, there's a Jesus's description that we see in chapter
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.240]   1.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:13.940]   It says, "The one who stands in the middle of the seven lampstands."
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.920]   You know, he has something against you, or he has something to say to you.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.700]   So every one of these characteristics is related to something related to the churches that
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.980]   he's going to be mentioning.
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:26.700]   So when he says that Jesus is standing in the midst of the seven churches, seven lampstands,
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.020]   what does that imagery teach us?
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:36.320]   He has very intimate knowledge of these seven churches, that he's not far away from these
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:42.360]   churches making observations through a microscope or from a distance.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.760]   Jesus is in the midst of them, so he knows them very well.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.360]   And we're going to see that as he describes the seven churches, right?
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.700]   He's in the midst.
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:58.560]   So chapter 1, basically introduction of Christ, introduction of him as the Alpha and Omega
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.020]   over the seven churches.
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:16.320]   Chapter 2 and 3 is a description and rebuke and encouragement of the seven churches.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:21.520]   So the seven churches, if you can see behind me, there's Ephesus, Myrna, Pergamum, Thyatira,
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:28.000]   Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.780]   Now I'm going to ask you is to see how much you remember.
[00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:44.580]   Which of the two churches that Jesus talks to that isn't rebuked?
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:52.100]   Philadelphia is one of them.
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.100]   Smyrna.
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.100]   Okay.
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:59.540]   So remember, Philadelphia and Smyrna are the only two churches where there isn't any specific
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.140]   rebuke, just encouragement.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:06.340]   Just for your memory, the first church is what?
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.740]   Ephesus.
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:11.080]   Last church is Laodicea.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:16.380]   So the two churches that aren't rebuked are the ones that are attached to these churches.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:22.400]   So Ephesus in the beginning, so you have Ephesus and Smyrna in the beginning.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.620]   And then at the end, Laodicea and Philadelphia.
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:31.180]   So that already takes care of four, right?
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:35.140]   Which church do you think has the greatest rebuke?
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:41.420]   Okay, let me put it this way.
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:45.760]   Which church has no encouragement at all?
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.760]   No exhortation?
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.760]   Laodicea.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.480]   Laodicea.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.260]   There's nothing good that's pointed out about this church at all.
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.220]   So we could say that the severest rebuke was for the last church.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.820]   And what was their primary problem?
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.620]   Lukewarm.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.960]   Lukewarm, right?
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:09.880]   So other churches, there's the sin of Nicolation, sin of Balaam, the sin of Jezebel.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:15.700]   So there are very specific sins mentioned, but the Laodicean church, which has no commendation
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:21.060]   for them, and the only sin that is pointed out is they're self-sufficient.
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.260]   They're lukewarm, right?
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:27.220]   Their churches, they're worshiping God, but they don't really need Him.
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:32.920]   And that was the greatest rebuke.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:40.340]   So I'm not going to go through all of them, but if you look at Ephesus, okay?
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:43.780]   Look at Ephesus, Revelation chapter 2, verse 1.
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:47.900]   To the angel of the church in Ephesus, the words of him who holds the seven stars in
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.580]   the right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands.
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:57.180]   So the very first letter is described as one who holds the stars and he walks among the
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.300]   seven golden lampstands.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:03.820]   So he's basically saying that there are certain things that may appear on the outside, but
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:06.460]   in reality, that's not true.
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:11.380]   So Church of Ephesus on the outside looks like a very strong church.
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:15.460]   It has all the right doctrines and tests the apostles to see if they were true.
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:21.780]   They have all the things that you need on the surface, but Jesus walks among the lampstands
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.460]   and he knows exactly where they are.
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.460]   He knows behind the scenes.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.940]   And he says, "I have this one thing against you, and that you have forsaken your first
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.220]   love."
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:34.660]   And this sin was severe enough, he says, "If you don't restore your first love, what does
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:35.660]   he say is going to happen?"
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.660]   He's going to take away your lampstand, right?
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.940]   Meaning the church is no longer going to be a church.
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:45.500]   You can gather together, you can sing the songs, right?
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:49.660]   You can have all this stuff, but the Spirit of God is going to be withdrawn, right?
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:56.380]   So how important is it that our first love is something that we fight for, right?
[00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.300]   So he intimately has knowledge of these things.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:04.500]   So then I think another church that he points out, Church of Sardis, he said, "You have
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:08.140]   the reputation of being alive, but you are actually dead," right?
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:13.860]   He said, "You have an appearance, everybody looks at you and you say, 'Wow, that's a
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.380]   living church,' but in reality, spiritually they're dead."
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:22.780]   So in other words, Christ is in the midst of them and you can't fool him, right?
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:27.820]   And so all of this is basically a setup of the judgment that's coming.
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:34.420]   So the historical application of all of this obviously is to specific churches.
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:41.140]   And then he's preparing them for the judgment that's going to come, okay?
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.980]   So when we get to the...
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:51.060]   Before we get to the judgments, right, what happens in chapter 4?
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:56.580]   Okay, look at your Bibles.
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:04.580]   I want you guys to fill in the blanks as we're going, okay?
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:05.580]   What happens?
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:10.060]   John is taken up to heaven.
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:11.580]   He gets a glimpse of...
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.980]   What does he get a glimpse of?
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.200]   The throne of God, right?
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:21.060]   So he's preparing them for the judgment that's coming, at least the vision of the judgment
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.060]   coming.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:27.980]   And before he shows them the judgment, the utter chaos that's about to be unleashed,
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:31.220]   every single one of these seals, every single one of these trumpets, and then ultimately
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:35.900]   the bowl judgments are going to create a stir, right?
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:40.740]   We're reading this 2,000 years removed and we read it, it's very disturbing, right?
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.420]   A third of the earth being wiped out, a fourth of the people that...
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:48.580]   They're going to be tortured, they're going to be begging to die and they can't die and
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:49.900]   they're being tormented.
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.540]   And we're only halfway through.
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.160]   The real severe stuff is coming at the second part.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.660]   So imagine if you were in first century, you're reading this or you're getting this or you
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:03.980]   get a vision of this, how that would make you feel, right?
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:08.260]   Anxious, fearful, right?
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:12.940]   Maybe terrified if this is actually going to happen, right?
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.280]   Terror may come.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:22.240]   So before he reveals to them what is about to happen, what does he show?
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.280]   The throne of God, right?
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.280]   God's throne.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.960]   He shows them the throne of God where God is in perfect control.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:34.840]   Where when he sees behind the scene where all of this is going to unravel because of
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:39.100]   God, God is sitting on his throne and they are worshiping him.
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:42.880]   And so that's something that I want you guys to notice that throughout these judgments,
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:49.600]   in between, whenever there's a break, God shows John a vision of the throne, right?
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.520]   And when he sees the vision of the throne, what is happening?
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.460]   Same thing, same thing that he sees in chapter four, you're going to see later on in chapter
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:04.280]   like nine and all you will see it in chapter 11 where God is sitting on his throne and
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.600]   they are worshiping him.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.500]   The world is falling apart, right?
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.400]   There's earthquakes, there's famine.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:14.280]   You have the red horse, the white horse, the pale horse, the black horse.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.360]   They're all coming out bringing judgment upon mankind, right?
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.480]   Plagues, there's wars.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:25.640]   All this is unraveling and John sees a glimpse of heaven and he's sitting on his throne and
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:31.420]   the elders and the creatures and the angels are all bowing down in worship, right?
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:34.480]   So no matter how chaotic this world gets, God is still sovereign.
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.560]   He's still sitting on his throne.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.880]   So that's the vision that he shows John.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.980]   Before he begins to show the judgments coming one by one, right?
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:51.200]   So that's chapter four.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:30:00.720]   Chapter five, it begins by in the scene of heaven where the elders and they're all crying,
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.720]   right?
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:07.120]   Because and why are they crying?
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.600]   There's no one worthy to open the seal, right?
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.800]   And then they say, well, the Lion of Judah is going to come.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.800]   He is worthy.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.120]   And then when they turn around, what do they see?
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.540]   A lamb, right?
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:17.820]   As if he was slain.
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:22.800]   So obviously that is a picture of Christ and what he came to do, right?
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:28.440]   The Lion of Judah who humbled himself, took on human form, right?
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:35.560]   And he became humble and you see Christ and the picture of Christ.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:42.600]   And then so if you see at the end of chapter four, heaven breaks out in worship for God.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.560]   And then at the end of chapter five, we see a vision of Christ as a lamb.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:51.720]   And then how does that chapter five end?
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.720]   Look at chapter five.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.720]   Don't look up here.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.840]   Okay, look at your Bible.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:05.880]   How does chapter five end?
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:06.880]   Worship of the lamb, right?
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:12.560]   Yeah, I want you guys to, this is review for you.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.340]   Okay?
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:18.960]   So chapter four, so before he goes into the judgments where the seals are beginning to
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:24.160]   open and then the judgment comes, he sees, he shows John a vision of heaven where they're
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.680]   all bowed down to worshiping God.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:30.800]   And then they turn it around and say, well, how is this going to be fulfilled?
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.880]   And then he sees the Lion of Judah who come in the form of the lamb, right?
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:39.600]   And obviously clearly he's going to be sacrificed for the sins of mankind.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.020]   And then chapter five ends with praise and adoration of the lamb.
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:48.120]   So before the judgment begins, there's scenes of worship, right?
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:52.760]   Two separate scenes of worship, the father and the son being worshiped.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.280]   Okay, so remember that.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:00.840]   So chapter one, introduction of Christ and the church.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:06.200]   Chapter two and three is the seven churches, right?
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.200]   Seven churches.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.680]   So remember the seven churches.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.120]   The first one is Ephesus.
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:13.280]   The last one is Laodicea.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:20.480]   And the two churches that doesn't get rebuked, Myrna, Philadelphia, and then, so we're only
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.740]   missing three.
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.960]   So what are the other three?
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.720]   Say it out loud.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.720]   What's after?
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.720]   Pergamum, Thyatira, and Sardis.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.880]   Okay, those are the three.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:40.080]   Okay, so if you remember the four easily, maybe the three will come better for you.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.080]   Okay?
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.060]   So that's chapter two and three.
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.760]   Chapter four, what happens?
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.680]   Door gets open to heaven, and what does he see?
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:56.240]   The throne of God, the 24 elders and the creatures bowing down and worshiping him.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:02.760]   And then we get to chapter five, father gets worshipped, lamb of God, right?
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.760]   The lamb of God comes, and then chapter five ends with the worship of the lamb.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:07.760]   Okay?
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.600]   So you got that basic outline of five chapters of Revelation up to this point.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.840]   So we get to chapter six.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.120]   Yeah, that's not a pepperoni pizza.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.120]   That's a seal.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.120]   Okay?
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:28.000]   I tried to find one that didn't look like a, you know, pizza, but then this one I showed
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   the best illustration.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.800]   You have the six seals and then ones on the bottom, the seventh seal.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.160]   And I think you know why.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.160]   Okay?
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:40.760]   So in the sixth seal, he opens up, the lamb opens up the first seal.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:48.640]   Remember the, okay, let me mention this before I move on to the seals.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:54.000]   Remember I told you, you had the seven seals, seven trumpets, and then you have the seven
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.600]   bowls, right?
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.000]   Judgment.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.280]   And there is a discussion as to whether these seven are supposed to be like linear, meaning
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.320]   that you have seven and then when seven closes, then another seven opens up.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.560]   And then when that closes, another seven opens up.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.960]   So that's one theory, right?
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.120]   But up to this point, remember what happens when you break the seventh seal?
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.160]   It doesn't really explain anything.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:22.020]   When the seventh seal is broken, what happens?
[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:23.880]   Trumpet opens up, right?
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.240]   The trumpet opens up.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:30.140]   And then when you get to the sixth trumpet, right?
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:33.680]   And then you get to the seventh, there's a, before the sixth and seventh, there's a long
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.160]   break of all of this happens.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:40.260]   When seventh seal gets, seventh trumpet blows, and then the bowl opens up, right?
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:47.360]   So this is the depiction, the illustration you see behind me is what I think is happening,
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.500]   where you have the seven.
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:53.560]   So the whole thing is happening in seven years, but at the end of seventh, on the seventh,
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:59.400]   the very last seal judgment, when that gets broken, it opens up the seventh trumpet.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:03.000]   And then at the seventh of the seventh trumpet, it opens up the seal, but it's all taking
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   place.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:12.360]   And what's happening is the very last seventh year, right before the Armageddon, it's going
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:15.000]   to be so intense, right?
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.560]   So you kind of starts out slowly.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.560]   And then remember, we get to the half year mark, and that's when it gets really intense,
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.560]   right?
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.560]   And we've only gone halfway.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.320]   The real intense stuff is going to happen with the bowl judgments.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:31.260]   And when the bowl judgments begin to open up, it's going to happen rapid fire.
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:36.400]   It's not once a year or once every few months, it's just coming boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.400]   right?
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.400]   It's kind of like fireworks.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.480]   You know, you begin slow with one or two cracking every once in a while, then you get to the
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.960]   end and it's more rapid.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:47.380]   And then the finale at the very end is boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:53.120]   So I think that that's what's happening, that these seven judgments are happening in seven
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.120]   years.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.160]   The intense stuff is happening in the three and a half second part.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:00.200]   And then the real intense stuff is at the very tail end.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.200]   Oh, sorry.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.200]   Before we move on.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.200]   Okay.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.200]   All right.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.200]   I can't mix up the order.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.200]   Okay.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.200]   So I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:42.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:37:06.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:34.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:38:15.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:43.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:25.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:32.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:31.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:46.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:48.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:41:13.200]   I'm going to go ahead and move on.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:19.400]   This is part of the reason why I believe that I believe the post trip theory because it
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:24.360]   doesn't seem like the church is going to be completely preserved from this.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:28.400]   The church is going to go through this and the intense suffering is in that's what the
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:33.040]   book of Revelation is written for is for the church to prepare.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:39.560]   And then the sixth seal, what happens?
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.560]   A huge earthquake hits, right?
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.040]   So all the seals, so let's go, let's review the seals.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.240]   Okay.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:53.800]   First one is the white horse and he brings conflict, right?
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.760]   To conquer, to conquer.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.680]   The red horse, right?
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.280]   He'll withdraw the peace from the world.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.080]   So there's going to be infighting.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:07.880]   Third horse, it's going to be famine, right?
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.560]   He comes out with a scale.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:14.600]   Fourth horse, the pale one, right?
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.600]   He's going to bring death.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:20.560]   And then the fifth one, the martyrs, right?
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:21.560]   On the altar crying out.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.560]   And then the sixth one, earthquake.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.560]   Okay.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.840]   All right.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.520]   So let's stop right there.
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:32.120]   This takes us all the way up to chapter six, right?
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:37.280]   Chapter one, introduction of Christ and the church.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.360]   Chapter two and three, okay, churches.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.360]   All right.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.480]   So seven churches.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.640]   Let's see if you can remember.
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.160]   Ephesus.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:53.560]   Ephesus is the church that lost their first love, right?
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:58.320]   Smyrna, the church that is not rebuked.
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:11.720]   Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:19.940]   Two churches that aren't rebuked is Philadelphia and Smyrna.
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:25.080]   One church that there is no commendation, Laodicea.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.080]   Okay?
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.920]   All right.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.320]   And then chapter four.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:36.120]   Remember, before the seal judgments happened, chapter four and five, right?
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:39.440]   They open the door, show him the throne of God.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.680]   And when he sees the throne of God, what do they see?
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.680]   Right?
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:49.120]   The 24 elders and the creatures and the angels are all bowing down and worshiping him, right?
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.440]   And then after that scene, we get to chapter five.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:54.440]   What do they see?
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:57.240]   Right.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:01.040]   The son, the father, and then the son in chapter five, right?
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:05.560]   The Lion of Judah come as a slain lamb.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:09.840]   And then chapter five ends with worship, right?
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:13.280]   Worship of the father, chapter four, worship of the son in chapter five.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:17.320]   And then chapter six opens up the six seals.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:24.680]   First seal, white horse, right?
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:31.240]   Mourning to conquer, red horse.
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:36.760]   Withdrawal of peace, black horse.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:41.480]   Your murmuring is getting smaller and smaller.
[00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:44.120]   Famine with a scale, right?
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:47.200]   The pale horse, death.
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.360]   And then the fifth seal?
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.040]   Okay, martyrs crying out.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.040]   Then sixth seal?
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.040]   It's an earthquake.
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.040]   All right.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:58.560]   So you got six chapters of outline in your head, hopefully, if you were a part of the
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.080]   people who are murmuring, okay?
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:04.720]   And then those who are keeping silent, maybe you don't know yet, okay?
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:05.720]   All right.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.080]   So what happens after this?
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.960]   Chapter seven, remember chapter seven?
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:09.960]   Right?
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.840]   We'd had six seals.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:15.640]   And then what does that lead us to?
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:21.400]   144,000 that's being sealed, right?
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:30.320]   These are the, again, we don't know, is that an actual number or is it symbolic?
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:35.240]   We don't know that for sure, but it seems like there's 144,000 and it mentions all the
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:43.080]   tribes of Israel that it may be referring to the nation of Israel being restored, right?
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:47.280]   And then after that comes what?
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:52.280]   After the 144,000 are sealed, what do they see after that?
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:57.960]   All the other nations standing behind them, right?
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.000]   Yes?
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.840]   Okay.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:07.160]   And then they also break out in worship, right?
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:10.120]   Before we transition into the seventh seal.
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:11.120]   Okay.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:18.480]   So you got to solve to chapter six, you have the six seals and then chapter seven between
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:22.560]   six and seven seal, there is 144,000 that is sealed.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:27.280]   And then the great nations, the multitude, it seems like the Gentile world is also behind
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.280]   them worshiping.
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.280]   Okay.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.520]   So you have up to chapter seven.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:39.760]   Chapter eight opens up the trumpets, right?
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:44.600]   Let's see how much of the trumpets you remember.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:49.760]   So the first angel blows a trumpet, what comes?
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.320]   Right.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:56.160]   Hail and fire.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:03.280]   And what I want you to pay attention in the trumpets is if you look at the seal, right,
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:08.240]   all this disaster is coming upon the earth, right?
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:14.560]   And the trumpets coming, half of the trumpet is still natural disaster.
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.720]   And then when the woes come, remember the three woes at the end, right?
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:25.780]   The fifth, sixth and seventh trumpet, the woes are targeted toward people, right?
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:32.680]   So up to this point, every disaster that came, God is still waiting for people to repent.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:37.400]   He's giving them a last chance opportunity in the midst of all of this persecution, not
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.960]   persecution, but disasters that they would come.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:44.600]   But what was the response of the people when all of this is happening?
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:45.920]   They're still clinging to their idols.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:50.240]   They said they refused, even after all of this, they still refuse to repent.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:53.940]   So up to this point, God is still being patient with them.
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:59.880]   So the first seal or first trumpet comes, hail and fire comes, right?
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:03.040]   And a third of the earth is burned up, right?
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:07.400]   So the first trumpet comes and the earth is burned up.
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:10.800]   The second trumpet blows, what happens?
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:17.800]   Mountain, it kind of, at least it sounds like a volcano, right?
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.480]   The mountain is burning up and then it's going into what?
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.440]   And a third of what dies?
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.640]   Sea, right?
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:28.680]   The fish and creatures in the sea die.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.680]   That's the second.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:33.100]   The second is the earth being burned up, right?
[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.740]   Second is the sea, third of the sea dying.
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:42.840]   And then a third trumpet blows, what happens?
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:45.980]   Star falls from the sky, right?
[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:51.040]   So first is the earth, hail and storm.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.960]   The earth is burned up, a third of the earth.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:57.960]   Second is mountains are on fire and a third of the ocean, right?
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.560]   Third of the creatures in the sea.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:05.320]   And then the third trumpet blows, a star falls from the sky, a third of the rivers and the
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:07.520]   spring waters, right?
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:11.920]   And this is where the word wormwood comes in, remember we talked about that, right?
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:17.320]   And third of the waters become wormwood and it seems like it's being poisoned.
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:21.200]   So maybe it's a nuclear fallout, we don't know what it is, but a third, a star falls
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:27.280]   from the sky and it reaches and it ruins all the still waters.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.640]   Third trumpet blows and what happens?
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:36.920]   He said that the third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, the third of the stars
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:41.440]   so that the third of their light might be darkened and a third of the day might be kept
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:44.560]   shining and likewise a third of the night.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:50.240]   So it seems like there's some sort of a cloud, a dark cloud that's hovering, right?
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:56.240]   Maybe it's a nuclear fallout, maybe it's as a result of the fallout this is happening,
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:57.240]   right?
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:01.400]   It's not obvious, but if you look at it, it's third, third of the earth, third of
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:05.560]   the ocean, third of the rivers, right?
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:10.680]   And a third of the sun, the moon and all of this gets darkened, right?
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:15.640]   So the trumpet is basically wiping out a third of the world.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:19.440]   And then in verse 13 it says, "Then I looked and I heard an eagle crying a loud voice and
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:23.520]   it flew directly overhead, 'Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth.'"
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:29.600]   So basically up to this point, right, it was disastrous, but the real intense stuff is
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:31.200]   coming, the "woe, woe, woe."
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.280]   So "woe, woe, woe" is referring to what?
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:38.940]   Fifth, sixth and seventh trumpet, right?
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:40.280]   So the real heavy stuff is coming.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.800]   So chapter 9 begins with the fifth trumpet.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:47.000]   So what happens with the fifth trumpet?
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:59.880]   Right, a star falls from heaven, right, to earth and that star doesn't seem like the
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:00.880]   star that we're thinking about.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:04.000]   It seems like it's some kind of a being, right?
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.720]   Remember we studied that?
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:10.600]   It doesn't, because the way it's described is the star is given a key to the bottomless
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.660]   pit.
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:14.320]   So it seems like a fallen angel.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.880]   So who would that be, right?
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:21.360]   Like an educated guess, we talked about this, that possibly this is Satan, right, talked
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:27.760]   about in Isaiah, that Satan falls and he's not given keys to the bottomless pit, meaning
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:30.160]   that he's the ruler.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:35.480]   He's being allowed, right, to take the powers and again, God is allowing him to bring judgment
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:36.480]   upon mankind.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.600]   So that's the fifth angel.
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:42.240]   So from now on, we see demonic presence, right?
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.680]   There's a direct demonic presence.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:48.000]   So up to this point, God's bringing judgment, but his angels are bringing judgment and he's
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.240]   restraining them to a certain degree because he wants them to repent, even in the midst
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:54.600]   of all of this disaster.
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.980]   But once the demons are released, what happens?
[00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:59.640]   There's no restraint in demons, right?
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:02.920]   Once they come out, they're to destroy and destroy only.
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.260]   They don't want to see people repent, right?
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:09.040]   And that's the "whoa, whoa, whoa" he's talking about.
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.840]   Okay?
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:20.240]   So the fifth trumpet blows, angel falls, and he's given keys to the bottomless pit.
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:23.000]   And again, and then he begins to bring disaster.
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.720]   And so when he's given the key, what happens?
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:31.880]   Army of locusts, right?
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.200]   Verse three.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:39.000]   The army of locusts come out, then they come to completely devour.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.960]   They come devour everything except for those who have the seal of God on their forehead,
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:43.960]   verse four.
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:48.280]   And that's the fifth seal.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:52.760]   And then it said, this first "whoa" is so intense, in verse six it says, "And in those
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:55.080]   days people will seek death and will not find it.
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:58.080]   They will long to die, but death will flee them."
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:00.080]   That's how intense, that's the first "whoa."
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.080]   Okay?
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:11.240]   So just to kind of recap, the first trumpet, hail and storm, third of the earth is burned.
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:21.040]   Second trumpet, mountain is burning, third of the ocean, right?
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:27.680]   Third trumpet, star falls, third of the rivers, right?
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:34.480]   Fourth trumpet, right, third of the moon, third of the stars, the clouds are going to
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.880]   cover all of it, it's going to be dark, right?
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.380]   And then the "whoa, whoa, whoa."
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:43.960]   The fifth trumpet blows, star falls from the sky, right?
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:50.720]   A fallen angel, possibly Satan, he releases demonic powers, and these demonic powers are
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:56.000]   represented in these locusts that are coming and devouring, and this devouring is so intense,
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.480]   right, that people want to die but they can't.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.400]   That's how intense the first "whoa" is.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:01.400]   That's the fifth.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:09.840]   So the sixth trumpet in verse 11, right, what happens?
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:14.480]   The four horns of the golden altar before God saying to the sixth angel who had the
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:18.640]   trumpet released the four angels who are bound at the great river of Euphrates.
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:26.880]   So these four angels who are holding back, they're released, and then plague comes in
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:27.880]   verse 18.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:34.000]   And it says, "A third of mankind is killed."
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.840]   So this sixth trumpet that blows, the angels releases whatever restraining power there
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:45.440]   was and then plague comes upon them and a third of mankind is wiped out, right?
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:52.480]   So this judgment is increasing, right, exponentially with each of these judgments.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:56.760]   And then in verse 20, it says, "The rest of mankind who are not killed by these plagues
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:01.120]   did not repent of the works of their hands, nor give up worshipping demons and idols of
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:07.320]   gold and silver, bronze and stone, and wood and cannot see or hear or walk, nor did they
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:11.360]   repent of their murders or their sorceries or their sexual immorality of their thefts."
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:16.000]   Even after all of this, God is waiting for them to repent and they're not repenting,
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.360]   even after all of this.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:28.680]   And then for chapter 10, sorry, that was chapter 9, the first of the woes.
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:31.440]   In chapter 10, remember this?
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:37.960]   An angel comes and he has one foot on land and one foot in the ocean, describing the
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:42.520]   power of this angel, that it is a big, powerful angel that comes.
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:46.080]   And he's holding a tiny scroll, right?
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:49.000]   And in this scroll, is it open or closed?
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.160]   Look at the picture.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:56.160]   It's open scroll, right?
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.040]   It's not closed, it's open.
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:03.560]   And then what is John told to do with the scroll?
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.400]   To eat it, right?
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.400]   To eat it.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:10.560]   And then he says, how is him eating going to, how is it described?
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:17.160]   It is, right, as sweet as honey in the mouth, but bitter in the stomach.
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:22.760]   So it doesn't say, but why do we say we think that is?
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:30.080]   Possibly, remember he says that he's, God promised he's no longer going to delay.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:34.880]   And what does it mean that God is going to come, he's no longer going to delay in coming.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:39.320]   So when he no longer delays, his second coming is bittersweet.
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:42.640]   It's sweet for those Christians who've been eagerly waiting and living soberly, and it's
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:45.320]   bitter for those who do not know Christ.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:52.100]   Because with the coming of Christ, there's going to come judgment, right?
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:55.040]   And that's true of any revival, right?
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:59.720]   When God's presence comes, typically we think when God's, you know, revival comes, that
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:02.820]   everybody's just going to feel happy and close to God.
[00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:08.340]   Revival doesn't come in the midst of unrepentant sinners.
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:12.460]   Revival comes because he comes to cause the church to repent and be purified.
[00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:15.340]   So when he comes, it's bittersweet, right?
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:17.140]   It's sweet because Christ is here.
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:20.580]   It's bitter because he comes to cause people to repent.
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:26.340]   So the word of God is always sweet and bitter, like the gospel comes and he brings condemnation,
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:27.340]   right?
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:31.500]   But along with condemnation, he promises restoration, right?
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:35.140]   So we look at the book of Revelation, all this judgment is coming, but the end result
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:39.460]   of all of this is God's fulfillment of his promise of salvation, right?
[00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:44.520]   I mean, we would like to skip through all of this and just get to heaven, right?
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:49.660]   But the process that God's going to take us through to get us to heaven is all of this,
[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:50.660]   right?
[00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:55.360]   So again, it doesn't spell that out, but the word of God is always sweet and bitter, right?
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:57.940]   It's sweet because it's from God.
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:00.660]   It's bitter because he's like a surgeon.
[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:05.620]   He's going to come and convict us of our sins, right?
[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:07.100]   So that's chapter 10.
[00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:09.780]   Then what happens in chapter 11, the last chapter?
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:15.360]   It begins with the measuring of the temple, right?
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:18.780]   He measures the temple, but God tells him, "Measure everything," but what he tells
[00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:21.980]   it not to measure?
[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:24.220]   The outer quarter, the Gentiles, right?
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:27.900]   And remember, what did that signify?
[00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:31.660]   Why do you take measurements in your house?
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:34.240]   Probably for renovation, for restoration, right?
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:38.540]   And that's exactly what God is promising, that his presence is going to be restored
[00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:45.420]   among his people, but he says, "Do not measure the outside," meaning he's talking about fake
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:47.620]   Christians, right?
[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:49.240]   Fake worshipers.
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:50.660]   He's going to prune the church.
[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:54.620]   He's going to allow deception to come in, and he's going to prune, and he's going to
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:59:00.580]   bring judgment upon people who are just kind of hanging on who aren't real, right?
[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:06.380]   So it's recognition of God's restoration, but also with restoration is going to come
[00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:09.780]   judgment inside the church, right?
[00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:12.940]   The second part is the two witnesses, right?
[00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:18.340]   And these are powerful witnesses, and what were they wearing?
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:19.340]   Sackcloth.
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:23.060]   And what do the sackcloth represent?
[00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.700]   Preaching and repentance.
[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:28.500]   So the imagery that we see of these two witnesses is kind of like John the Baptist, and his
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:31.380]   message was, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:37.860]   So it seems like these two witnesses are coming, and they're preaching message of repentance.
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:41.300]   He's basically kind of like functioning as John the Baptist, preparing for the coming
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:42.300]   of Christ.
[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:46.300]   So how was their message received?
[00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:48.780]   Remember?
[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:52.680]   Was there a revival that broke out?
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:56.380]   What happened?
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:58.020]   They hated them, right?
[00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:02.420]   They hated them so much that when the beast from the abyss comes up, and he overpowers
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:06.540]   them and kills them, what do they do?
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:10.940]   They leave him out in the great city of Jerusalem, and they don't bury him.
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:14.540]   They basically mock him, and they celebrate his death, right?
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:21.260]   Then after three and a half days, they rise back up, and they go to heaven.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.580]   Now we don't know the identity of these two.
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:29.260]   You know, some say Elijah and Moses, or maybe Enoch and Elijah.
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:33.560]   We don't know for sure, but it seems like the message is pretty clear.
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:41.620]   God is sending his messengers and proclaiming judgment and repentance, and to the very end,
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:45.380]   the world is holding on, and they're not repenting.
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:46.380]   Okay?
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:49.140]   All right, let's review real quick.
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:50.580]   Okay, let's see.
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:55.020]   If you followed me up to this point, and you remember this, this is huge, okay, because
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:59.420]   so few Christians know what is contained in this book.
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:04.060]   The fact that even if you can say chapter seven, and you know what's in chapter seven,
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.740]   right, you're already a student, all right?
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:10.580]   So hopefully, by the end of tonight, you'll be able to do that, okay?
[01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:13.700]   You'll know the flow of the book, at least halfway through it.
[01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:18.900]   All right, so you can kind of look through your notes for now, and then I'm going to
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.940]   test you without it afterwards.
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:25.300]   So chapter one, just yell it out.
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:27.060]   This is a group project now.
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:30.060]   Chapter one, introduction.
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:33.300]   Okay, Jesus, right?
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.240]   Introduction to the description of Christ.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:40.840]   Chapter two and three, seven churches, right?
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:45.140]   So the seven churches, let's see if we can get it in order.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:56.500]   Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and the Odyssea.
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.300]   Okay, good.
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:10.300]   Chapter four, he's taken up in spirit, and he's shown the throne of God, and the angels,
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:14.140]   the creatures, the elders are all worshiping, right?
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:18.460]   And they turn around in chapter five, they're all crying because no one was worthy to open
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:23.020]   up the seal, and he says, "The Lion of Judah is worthy.
[01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:24.020]   He's coming."
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:26.020]   They turn around, what do they see?
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:27.300]   Lamb, okay?
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:30.900]   And then chapter five ends with worship of the Lamb.
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:35.380]   So worship of God, chapter four, worship of the Lamb in chapter five.
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:40.860]   Chapter six, seals, right?
[01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:42.460]   The seal judgments open up.
[01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:43.460]   So the four...
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.140]   No, I won't say it.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:49.260]   So when the seal judgment opens up, what's the first seal?
[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:53.580]   White horse, conquering, red horse.
[01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:59.380]   Okay, I'm going to turn this off.
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:00.380]   Takes away the peace.
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:06.460]   Black, okay, has a scale.
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:08.140]   Okay, famine.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:09.140]   And then the pale.
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.140]   Death, right?
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:17.980]   And then the fifth seal, the martyrs crying out under the altar.
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:22.780]   Sixth seal, earthquake, okay?
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:29.180]   And then chapter seven, remember it's connected to the seal.
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:35.220]   144,000 sealed.
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:40.260]   And after that, right, the Gentile nations behind them, right?
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:43.900]   And they break out again, it's a scene of worship.
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:49.540]   Chapter eight, the trumpet judgments open up.
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:53.460]   So trumpet judgments, what's the first one?
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:57.700]   Hell and fire, third of the earth is burned.
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:01.740]   Second trumpet.
[01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:04.460]   Mountains on fire, third of the ocean.
[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:05.460]   Third trumpet.
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:12.620]   Okay, falling star, a third of the rivers, right?
[01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:13.620]   Is wiped out.
[01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:14.620]   Fourth trumpet.
[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:22.220]   Sun, moon, stars, like they smoked, blocks out a third, okay?
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:26.740]   And then the three, next judgment is called three woes.
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.300]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, right?
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.100]   You have three woes.
[01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:44.940]   And the first woe, okay, a fallen star, seems like it's not the physical star but some sort
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:47.040]   of an angelic being that falls.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:54.020]   He gets the key to the, right, he gets a key to the bottomless pit and he opens up and
[01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:58.740]   he brings out an army of soldiers, locusts, right?
[01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:01.620]   And what do they do?
[01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:06.980]   Right, they're torturing and tormenting, right?
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:11.180]   And then they want to die but they can't, that's how severe it is, right?
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:19.540]   So sixth seal.
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:30.580]   Okay, sixth seal comes, okay, sorry, that's chapter, we're already in chapter nine, the
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:33.860]   woes are chapter nine, right?
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:40.780]   So the sixth seal comes, third of mankind, right?
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:45.940]   There's pestilence, disease come, a third of mankind is wiped out, right?
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:52.620]   Chapter 10, big angel, right?
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.740]   The big angel, what does he have?
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:06:01.900]   Okay, he has a tiny scroll and John, okay, he's supposed to eat it, right?
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:04.660]   It's sweet in the mouth, bitter in the stomach.
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:11.500]   Chapter 11, measuring of the temple, right?
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:18.580]   So measure the outer court and then the two witnesses, right?
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:22.500]   Two witnesses and then they're very powerful, anybody who comes against them, they're able
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:26.940]   to kill, they have the authority to kill with fire, right, from their mouth and then they're
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:33.660]   hated and then the beast, that's the first time we see the beast coming out.
[01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:36.260]   Is the beast Satan?
[01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:38.300]   No, right?
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:43.420]   He's not Satan, so possibly he's the Antichrist because he's feeding off of Satan, later on
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.660]   he'll come back out, right?
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:49.260]   And then they come back to life and then they're up in heaven.
