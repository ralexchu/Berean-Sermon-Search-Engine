[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.920]   Welcome to Bruin Community Church.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.920]   As you guys know, our team was out in Korea
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.920]   and then our Korean team came back last Saturday
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.920]   and the Indian team came out yesterday.
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.920]   So after the announcement, our brother Matt Chong
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.920]   is gonna be coming up and giving his testimony
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.920]   about what he saw and experienced.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.920]   But prior to that, let's see.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.920]   We have a few announcements before we get started.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.920]   First of all, you probably saw as you were coming in,
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.920]   the college group is setting up a fundraiser outside
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.920]   and so there will be lunch provided between this service
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.920]   and then after the third service
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.920]   because we have a members meeting,
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.920]   a beginning of the year members meeting at 2 p.m.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.920]   And so there's gonna be a Chipotle Bowl
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.920]   for $10 for adults and $5 for children
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.920]   to go to the college.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.920]   Again, it'll be used for the college retreat
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.920]   that's coming up later.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.920]   I think it's in March.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.920]   So please go out and if it's not raining,
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.920]   I think there might be some chairs and tables set up outside
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.920]   or you can go to the cafe.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.920]   If it's after the third service and you can't be outside,
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.920]   we might be able to open it up here.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.920]   But anyway, the lunch fellowship is going to be happening.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.920]   Lunch fundraiser is gonna be happening
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.920]   after this service as well.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.920]   So please come to the room before 2 p.m.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.920]   'cause we're gonna get started right at 2 p.m., okay?
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.920]   Family ministry workshop.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.920]   This coming Saturday,
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.920]   if you are part of the family ministry,
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.920]   there's going to be a vision and purpose meeting
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.920]   for the beginning of the year
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.920]   and kind of set the tone for the rest of the year.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.920]   So if you're part of the FAM245
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.920]   or you're part of the FIG ministry
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.920]   or the Jubilee ministry,
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.920]   there will be a brief presentation of each group
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.920]   and then for the whole ministry as well.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.920]   So please sign up for that and it'll take place at 2 p.m.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.920]   and I believe that there is childcare for that.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.920]   Coming up on February 9th, there's gonna be communion.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.920]   We'll remind you again next week.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.920]   Family ministry prayer meeting.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.920]   If you are interested in one of the ways
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.920]   that you can devote yourself to prayer is to join that
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.920]   and on Saturday on February 8th at 9.15 a.m.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.920]   at the youth chapel,
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.920]   the family ministry is gonna be gathering together
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.920]   to pray for specific needs in the church.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.920]   So please come to that and let them know that you're coming
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.920]   so they can prepare for that.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.920]   Sprouts PTA.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.920]   If you have a child in kindergarten all the way to sixth grade,
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.920]   there is a meeting, beginning of the year meeting
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.920]   that's happening on February 9th at 2 p.m. in this room.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.920]   So again, this is for all the parents
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.920]   who have children from kindergarten to sixth grade.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.920]   Again, there will be a meeting here at 2 p.m. on February 9th.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.920]   And finally, men's ministry fellowship.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.920]   We have a quarterly men's ministry that happens at this church
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.920]   and on February 15th at 9 a.m.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.920]   we will be having, again, men's ministry fellowship
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.920]   and lunch at that time.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.920]   Again, February 9th is the last day to sign up
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.920]   and the cost of it will be $10.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.920]   So please sign up for that.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.920]   There will be a sign-up table as you go outside.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.920]   And I think that's it.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.920]   So let me pray for the offering and then after that,
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.920]   our brother Matt Chong is gonna come up and give his testimony
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.920]   and then we'll jump into the rest of the service.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.920]   Okay, let's pray.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.920]   Father, we thank you for this morning
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.920]   and thank you for sustaining our mission teams
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.920]   and that we were able to come back safely.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.920]   We pray, Father God, that you continue to bless our church
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.920]   as you've given us resources, manpower.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.920]   Help us, Lord God, to hone that energy
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.920]   for your purpose and your kingdom.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.920]   Help us, Lord, that even in our giving,
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.920]   that it would genuinely be an act of worship,
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.920]   that it may be handled with wisdom
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.920]   and for the purpose of your kingdom.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.920]   Help us to give joyfully, cheerfully,
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.920]   and that it may be multiplied, Lord God,
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.920]   that your name may be honored and glorified.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.920]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.920]   - Hi church family.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:06.920]   Before I start, as I was kind of going through my reflections,
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:11.920]   we got back last night and I feel like I could have had more time
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.920]   just to reflect and digest more.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.920]   But just a thought just came to my mind as I was reviewing
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:22.920]   was that God is good, he is sovereign, he is faithful
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.920]   and his gospel work is being done everywhere.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.920]   And so, if I'm not able to communicate that through my reflection,
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.920]   hopefully you guys can see that.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.920]   So, hi again, my name is Matt Chong.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.920]   I'm part of the family ministry.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.920]   And I had the privilege of being a part of this year's India missions team.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.920]   Our church has been partnered with the pastors in India
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.920]   for I believe a decade now.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.920]   And ever since I heard the story of Pastor Matthew,
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.920]   I've always been challenged and encouraged
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.920]   by the gospel work being done in the villages.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.920]   When thinking about going on Brilliant's missions trips to India,
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.920]   there's kind of always an excuse not to go.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.920]   Whether it was work, my kids, feeling like I don't have any skills,
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.920]   what use could I be.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.920]   But in the end, they're just excuses.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.920]   But I remember a year or so ago, I mentioned to my wife,
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:22.920]   it would be nice to go to India one day on the missions trip.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.920]   Just kind of in passing and then kind of left.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.920]   And then my wife just several months later randomly was like,
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.920]   "Hey, you should go ask to join the India missions team."
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.920]   I was like, "Oh, okay."
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.920]   And so that kind of gave me the encouragement to ask Pastor Peter.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:42.920]   And by God's grace, some spots opened up and I was able to go.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.920]   Like I mentioned, I don't really have any technical skills,
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.920]   so I just kind of wanted to be helpful
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.920]   and just give everything I could to be useful on the trip.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.920]   But a big part of me of wanting to go was just to meet the pastors
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.920]   and just to see the work that was being done.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.920]   Our team, again, was split between a medical team,
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.920]   an optometry team, security, and VBS.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.920]   I was recruited to join the VBS team, which was led by Sky.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.920]   I joined with Esther, Abby, and George,
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.920]   kind of a mix of all our affinity groups.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.920]   Just a quick recap, we kind of settled in.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.920]   And pretty much from day one, we left to the villages,
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.920]   which is about an hour, two-hour drive, kind of did our programs,
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.920]   and then came back an hour or two drive, had dinner,
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.920]   met as a team, and then that was just a repeat,
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:34.920]   and then for four days straight, and then came home.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.920]   I can talk about our VBS team and what we did.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.920]   We ran a program where we sang songs through body worship,
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.920]   shared Bible stories, played games,
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:48.920]   shared the gospel through kind of the Salvation Bracelet craft.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.920]   Again, here are some of my reflections.
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.920]   I really enjoyed my time.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.920]   It was fun.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.920]   I had a lot of fun.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.920]   It was encouraging to fellowship with our church family,
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.920]   sharing devotions, having meals together,
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.920]   laboring together and serving.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.920]   It was just awesome.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.920]   It was encouraging just to see we all had different parts,
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:13.920]   including the pastors,
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.920]   and we're all doing our part to further this work.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.920]   There was just something refreshing waking up every morning
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.920]   and kind of asking, like, "What's my purpose?"
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:27.920]   And just being very clear, like, "Why am I here?"
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.920]   Another reflection I had was I grew a love for the children.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.920]   I was serving India.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.920]   People ask me, it's like, "Are you excited?"
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.920]   It's like, "I don't know.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.920]   I don't know anybody there.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.920]   I haven't been, but, man, I grew a love for those kids."
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:46.920]   And it just reminded me how important children's ministry is.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.920]   When I say I enjoyed serving, it was mainly serving the kids.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.920]   Their smiles, their enthusiasm, and just their gratitude
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:00.920]   and just us serving them made it very easy to serve.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.920]   Though we are limited in our communication,
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.920]   my prayer is that we had planted some seeds in them,
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.920]   and through the gospel we shared, through the love of Christ,
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.920]   we were able to show through our actions that God would continue to work
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.920]   in their hearts to save them.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.920]   It was even encouraging to see kind of the adults hovering around
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.920]   and seeing smiles on their face.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:27.920]   And my hope is that through our work, the pastors come back to these villages
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.920]   and can have opportunities to share the gospel with them as well.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:37.920]   Another reflection I had was I got to meet some amazing men of God there.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.920]   In the few car rides and dinner times, I got to hear their life stories,
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.920]   their testimony, and it was very humbling.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:50.920]   These men received the word of God for comfort and security
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.920]   just for the work of the gospel.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:57.920]   I'm probably doing a disservice just to how great these men are.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.920]   They're so humble and relatable, yet very powerful
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:05.920]   in just what they've been doing with their lives.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.920]   So I don't really know how to kind of conclude my thoughts.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.920]   I just kind of had these jotted down.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.920]   My hope is that we all can pray and support and partner with the pastors
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.920]   and the gospel work in India.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.920]   Our team, through our devotions, went through Thessalonians.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.920]   And as we were reading, we kept hearing about how the Thessalonians
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:33.920]   received the word of God amidst much persecution, opposition, and suffering.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.920]   And it was just very humbling to see that these pastors in India are--
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.920]   actually, this is like their life.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.920]   And as I kind of reflected myself, I was like,
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.920]   what's hindering the work of the gospel in my life?
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.920]   And I was thinking persecution wasn't the right word.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.920]   It was comfort.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.920]   And I still have a lot to digest and think through,
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:01.920]   but my mind feels very clear to think about these things,
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.920]   to think about my own life and purpose here back home.
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.920]   And the last thought was just an encouragement
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.920]   to those serving in the children's ministry.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.920]   You guys are amazing.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.920]   Keep planting the seeds.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.920]   God is using it.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.920]   It was fun just to see--
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.920]   Pastor Peter had mentioned that our work in VBS could seem like
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.920]   it's kind of a side thing.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.920]   You do these two cool medical missions thing and kind of this side VBS program.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:36.920]   But the kids, their first exposure to Christians,
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:41.920]   to the enthusiasm, to just the love of Christ,
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.920]   it will pay fruit in the future.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.920]   So as the pastors go to those villages more and more,
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:54.920]   maybe they're met with less hostility and more intrigued by the gospel.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.920]   Thank you, church family, for your prayers and support.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.920]   My hope is that even in the short reflection,
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.920]   you're able to see that God is faithful, God is sovereign, and God is good.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.920]   Thank you.
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:19.920]   [applause]
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.920]   As we jump back into Colossians 4, 2-4,
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.920]   it's going to be part 2 of what I started a few weeks ago,
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.920]   and then I'm going to finish the sermon based on the vision.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:35.920]   As our brother Matt has shared, we came back from India.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.920]   The flight from the moment we left the hotel until we probably got home
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.920]   was probably about 44 to 46 hours.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:47.920]   So not fully here yet, not fully adjusted.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:53.920]   This was our 10th anniversary of going into India,
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.920]   and not going into all the history of how we started going there,
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:03.920]   but Pastor Sake, who was my main contact when we first started the ministry,
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:08.920]   obviously the hostility toward Christianity is growing exponentially over there.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.920]   So we can tell, even now as we check into the hotel,
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.920]   before we would just check in, get our key, and get into our room,
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.920]   but now there's this huge security check.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.920]   Whether we're coming through the airport or we're checking into a hotel,
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.920]   we have to go through and give them our passport,
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.920]   we have to give them a copy of our visa.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.920]   This is at the hotel that we're checking in,
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.920]   and we have to explain to them why we're here,
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.920]   and then they have to hand it over to the police station,
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.920]   and the police station calls back and says, "Why are these foreigners here?"
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:40.920]   And it's in such large numbers because there's so many of us coming.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.920]   One or two, maybe we won't get flagged, but so many of us are coming.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.920]   And so previous year, last year, they kept on calling all throughout the week,
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.920]   checking, "Why is this visa this way? What are they doing every day?"
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.920]   And then this time, the security was even tighter than before,
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:58.920]   and so they called Pastor Sake on Monday after we checked in,
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.920]   we're in the village, and he told me that he was having a conversation with the police station,
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.920]   and they kept on asking him, "What is their purpose here?"
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:12.920]   And we say, "We came to visit," but over and over, that many people,
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:19.920]   and the greatest attraction there is this large rock fork
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.920]   that they have sitting on the top of a hill, but they're not dumb.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.920]   We tell them that, but they kept on asking.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:32.920]   And so Pastor Sake, he told me that he told them that these are medical workers
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.920]   that have come to help our people in the remote villages,
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.920]   and so he began to explain to them.
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   He said, "Yes, they are Christians, but they're here to do medical work."
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.920]   And he told me that at the end of that conversation,
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:46.920]   the police station actually said, "Take good care of them."
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.920]   He said, "They came to help our people."
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.920]   And then so obviously, Pastor Sake is, "Yeah, that's why we're here.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.920]   We're going to be helping them."
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.920]   And so that was great to hear, that we were kind of concerned
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:01.920]   because the police station was on top of us and was watching us.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.920]   And so that is not how a lot of the Christians are met there,
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:07.920]   who are working there.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.920]   Obviously, even those who are hostile toward the faith,
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.920]   the fact that we have medical workers coming and helping them
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.920]   with their high care and various medical things, they're very thankful.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.920]   But even in the midst of that, there are people who are so bent
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:29.920]   on eradicating Christianity there that even that kind of stuff, they don't want.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.920]   And so we still have to be careful that we don't run into that.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.920]   But I was very thankful that at least this time around,
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:39.920]   that at least whoever was ahead of the police station was calling,
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.920]   that they saw us favorably, that we were there.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.920]   And so our whole work is, obviously, we can't communicate with the village people,
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.920]   but we're able to be there and set a platform, and they ask questions,
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.920]   "Why did these Christians come to help us when we're not even Christians?"
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.920]   And that's the most common question that we get.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.920]   And then they are very thankful to the pastors who brought us.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.920]   And so that gives them a platform for them to go back into these villages.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:10.920]   In fact, the very last village that we went to, they told us that this village is--
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.920]   this is the first time going in.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.920]   Christians have been persecuted in this village, but the village leader
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.920]   in that particular village welcomed us to come in.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.920]   So when we got there, it was the smallest group
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.920]   because typically there are some Christians waiting for us,
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.920]   but because there are very few Christians,
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.920]   I think two or three families at the most in that village.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.920]   And we saw that the numbers represented that,
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.920]   but about 10 minutes into what we were doing,
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.920]   the leaders of the villages started to come,
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.920]   and there was about five or six of them with some other assistants
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.920]   that came into the room.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.920]   And even the pastors were kind of surprised that they were coming.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.920]   And so you can tell when leaders come into the village, it's a big deal.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.920]   Everybody kind of moves out of the way.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.920]   They just walk right in.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.920]   Everybody grabs a chair, gives them the highest honored seat,
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.920]   and so they sit down.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.920]   So we knew there was somebody important
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:04.920]   and then found out that they were the party leaders of that region.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:09.920]   And the party that they represent are working directly with BJP,
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:11.920]   who is hostile toward Christians.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.920]   And so I asked the pastor, "So this political party is against Christianity?"
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.920]   And he said, "Yes."
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.920]   So I said, "Oh, they're sitting here."
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.920]   And so typically we have somebody share the gospel or share their testimony,
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.920]   sing some Christian songs before we get started.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.920]   So I was watching the pastors to see what they would do,
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.920]   if they were going to back down from this and try to be cautious.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.920]   But sure enough, they started singing,
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.920]   and I could tell there was some nervousness in the room.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.920]   And Pastor Sake started to speak.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.920]   He spoke like any other village, and he started to share about Christianity.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:47.920]   And then our brother Kwon stood up, and he gave his testimony,
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.920]   gave a clear presentation of the gospel.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:53.920]   And so because the pastors were willing to preach clearly,
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.920]   I was able to stand up at the end,
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:01.920]   and I shared my angle of our Christian faith to the leaders.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.920]   And afterwards the pastor told me, he said,
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.920]   "It was very good that we had this meeting
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.920]   because these leaders represent 34 different villages,
[00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.920]   and they represent their party."
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:16.920]   And you could tell because they were wearing a scarf that represented our party.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.920]   And they said this was probably the first time they'd ever heard about the gospel,
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:24.920]   that they were able to hear it three separate times in one meeting.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.920]   And so at the end, we were just kind of watching to see
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.920]   what kind of response that we would get from them.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.920]   And so they got the first crack at all the medical and eye care,
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.920]   and they left with nice sunglasses.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.920]   And as they were leaving, they were looking for me
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.920]   because I was sitting outside with Pastor Matthew,
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.920]   and they went out of their way to thank me for bringing our team over.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.920]   And then so we were able to shake hands,
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.920]   and so the pastors told me that they were very favorable to us
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.920]   because of what we've done.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.920]   And then at the end, as we were leaving,
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.920]   Pastor Saki said, "Next year when we come,
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.920]   that they're hoping to break into the following,
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.920]   the village that has crossed them,"
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.920]   because that's where the majority of the persecution was taking place.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.920]   But because now those leaders are favorable to us,
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:10.920]   that they're going to begin their work in that next village.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.920]   And so they said that after we leave,
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.920]   they're going to have a team start to go in there,
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.920]   and they're hoping to plant the church.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.920]   And if we come back next year,
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.920]   they said we're going to probably have our camp in that village.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.920]   And that's the village where, again,
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.920]   it probably wasn't safe for us to go in.
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.920]   But because the leaders were behind what we were doing,
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.920]   we were able to get in.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.920]   And so that's the work that we did,
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.920]   and it is physically grueling.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.920]   And traveling before I was 50,
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.920]   and then now that I'm a couple years beyond 50,
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.920]   physically, obviously, I can tell.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.920]   Yesterday I had a nice seat on the airplane,
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.920]   17 hours from Doha to come back,
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.920]   and I was in the front seat, and I said, "Okay, I can get some rest.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.920]   Maybe I can open up my laptop, review my sermon."
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:59.920]   And then I found out that this young lady with an infant baby sat next to me.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.920]   [laughter]
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:06.920]   And it turned into the nicest trip to the most difficult trip the whole way back.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.920]   So I'm a little bit tired.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.920]   It's 1.30, so if I start saying gibberish,
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.920]   it's because I'm not fully here yet.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.920]   I did have a cup of coffee, so hopefully that helps out.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.920]   But prior to India, we were out in Korea,
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.920]   and there's about five of us who was in Korea,
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:27.920]   and then we made our trip to India.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:31.920]   And I come back from India, obviously energized and strengthened,
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.920]   maybe not physically, but spiritually.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:38.920]   Going to Korea, more than ever,
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.920]   I am convinced that we need to be in this country.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:46.920]   There are some things that I'm going to ask you to pray for in the members' meeting,
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:52.920]   but how quickly Christianity has fallen in this country is mind-boggling.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.920]   Because even throughout seminary,
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.920]   Korea has been the talk of conversation among the mission field.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:08.920]   How quickly and how strongly Christianity came into Korea in the last 100 years,
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.920]   especially the last 50 years,
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.920]   how dramatically the country changed because of Christianity.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.920]   And so missiologists, people who study missions,
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.920]   Korea is on the top of the list of studies,
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.920]   like how revival breaks out, how the gospel came in.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.920]   And at one point, it was a country that had less than 1% Christian
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:33.920]   in the 50 to 60 years, went from less than 1% to 33%
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.920]   in pretty much one generation.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:41.920]   And then to have that fall back down to below 2%
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.920]   for people who are 23 and under is mind-boggling,
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.920]   how quickly they rose and how quickly they fell.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.920]   Was it the threat of communism because of North Korea?
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.920]   Was it their influence that caused this sharp decline?
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:01.920]   Was it because of lack of discipling or organization or the support?
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.920]   I don't think anybody can argue that because Korea has become
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.920]   an epicenter for seminary education for all of Asia
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.920]   because they have so many megachurches who have funding
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:18.920]   and so many pastors and theologians with PhD that have come here to Europe to study
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:23.920]   and they've gone back and established many, many schools over there.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.920]   So I don't think anybody can argue that that was the reason
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.920]   or maybe it's because of the great political turmoil.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:33.920]   Recently, they impeached a sitting president because he declared martial law
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.920]   and then just read this morning that he was indicted by their court,
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.920]   that he was guilty and they're going to probably send him to prison.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.920]   And this was a sitting president that they did too.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:47.920]   And so was it because of the great political turmoil that affected the church?
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.920]   Every opportunity I get to sit with a Christian leader in Korea,
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.920]   I ask them that question.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:56.920]   What do you think was the downfall of Christianity in this young generation?
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:03.920]   And the universal answer that I get from them is that Korea's fast-growing economy
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.920]   basically affected the church.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:12.920]   As much as Christianity grew rapidly in this country, their economy followed along.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:17.920]   In the 1950s after the Korean War, they were not one of the poorest country.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:22.920]   I think it could be argued that they were the poorest country after the Korean War.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:27.920]   Countries like Haiti and many other Third World countries felt so bad for Korea
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.920]   that even they sent support to help Korea.
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.920]   World Vision, Compassion International, so many orphanage organizations
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:39.920]   started out in Korea because there were so many orphans after the war.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:46.920]   And so a country that may have been the poorest country in the 1950s and '60s
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:52.920]   has become one of the biggest economies in Asia in a matter of four or five decades.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:56.920]   So as much as Christianity is studied, they also study the economy of Korea
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.920]   and how quickly it grows.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:06.920]   And so most Christian leaders will say that Christianity has been deeply affected
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:13.920]   because people became rich and riches basically has corrupted the church.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:19.920]   Seoul, in that one city, nine of the ten largest megachurches.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.920]   In the United States, if you have over 2,000 people,
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.920]   they start labeling you a megachurch.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.920]   In Korea, you're not a megachurch until you have 30,000.
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:33.920]   Three, four, five, 6,000, they consider that a medium-sized church over there.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:39.920]   Nine of the ten largest churches, which means there's a concentration of finance.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.920]   There's a concentration of organization.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:44.920]   There's a concentration of scholarship in this one city
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.920]   more than any other city in the world.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:55.920]   Korea, South Korea, was the number two sending missionary country in the world
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.920]   behind America.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:03.920]   Compassion International says that they have the second largest funding
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:10.920]   to support the orphan work in the world from South Korea.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:13.920]   They have more human resources, manpower,
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.920]   than the church has ever experienced outside of the United States,
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:21.920]   and yet they have completely lost the next generation.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.920]   What has corrupted the church is not a lack of manpower,
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.920]   is not a lack of know-how, is not a lack of scholarship,
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.920]   is that there's a tendency when the church becomes rich,
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:39.920]   just like Jesus said, is more difficult than a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven,
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.920]   than a camel to enter through an eye of a needle,
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:48.920]   because riches tend to corrupt more than anything else.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.920]   If you look at the history of Christianity,
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:55.920]   persecution actually purifies the church.
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:00.920]   When I ask the pastors, "How has persecution affected what you are doing here?"
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.920]   And he says, "Yes, it's difficult."
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.920]   It's difficult because they don't know where they're going to get stoned.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.920]   They don't know.
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:11.920]   In fact, many of the pastors, because the local government is refusing support for them,
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.920]   that their children are not able to go to school.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:19.920]   And so, because of the persecution, some have already fallen out, even among the pastors.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.920]   They said three of the pastors that they were working with,
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:27.920]   that because of fear of the backlash that is coming from their neighbors and from the government,
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.920]   that three of them had fallen out.
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:32.920]   But he said what has happened to the church, it has purified the church.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:36.920]   Nominal Christianity cannot exist in this country.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:44.920]   No one is going to risk a well-being for themselves physically and financially to be a nominal Christian.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.920]   And so, it may be harder to be a Christian there, but it has purified the church,
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:54.920]   and they are more determined than ever to bring the gospel to the remotest part of the world.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.920]   We've seen this even in China.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:06.920]   When we first started going out to China about 1997, 1998, Christianity was beginning to blow up in this area.
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.920]   And so, we were excited every time.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.920]   It was just like people are excited every time they come back from India.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.920]   Some of you guys who were there in the early years when we were coming in and out of China,
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:18.920]   every time we came back, it was like it was spreading the gospel.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.920]   Like you don't have to do anything other than sit at McDonald's and open up the Bible.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:25.920]   Just speak English and talk about Christ, and somebody wants to sit down and have a conversation.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.920]   It was that easy.
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:34.920]   And as years went by, we began to notice that their hunger for the gospel began to get squashed.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:42.920]   As the money came in, more and more we began to see the churches over there began to reflect the churches here.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.920]   You have young, up-and-coming college grads who are attending church,
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:51.920]   and their primary goal is they want Christ, and they want to become more like the Christians in the United States
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:54.920]   who have the freedom to travel, have money.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:57.920]   And they equated Christianity with America.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.920]   And Americans are rich.
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:05.920]   And so much of the gospel that began to penetrate into China in the later part
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:10.920]   was because they equated Christianity with Christianity here.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:15.920]   That our life and our blessing will look like the Christians in America.
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:19.920]   And so the health and wealth gospel came in.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:24.920]   When you talk to the underground church and you ask them what the number of Christians is, it's very different.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:31.920]   You may have heard somewhere between 300 million to 600 million to maybe 100 million.
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:36.920]   But when you ask the underground church what the number of Christianity is,
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:39.920]   they'll give you a completely different number.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:44.920]   If you're talking about how many people say that they're Christians, yes, you make 300, 400 million.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:49.920]   If you're talking about people who have been born again genuine followers of Christ,
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:54.920]   it says probably a very small fraction of that number.
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:46:00.920]   I remember years ago when China was having their Olympic, I think it was 2008,
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:04.920]   we've been in and out of China for almost a decade by that time, and we were all, not just me,
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.920]   but all the mission organizations, all the Western church has been waiting and praying for China to open up
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.920]   so that we can go in there freely, share the gospel, to plant churches.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:18.920]   And so because we were so invested in China, we were praying for China to be open, along with everyone else.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:25.920]   And we were expected, and we were planning, what are we going to do when we get into China?
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.920]   Are we going to buy some property?
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:31.920]   What is our English camps going to look like when they're completely open?
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.920]   And then we began to talk to some of the underground church leaders,
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:39.920]   and they said that they were praying so that China would not open.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.920]   And what a slap in the face.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:48.920]   Because all the Western missionaries and churches have been praying for it to open so that we can have full access to China.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:52.920]   But the underground church leaders were saying that they're praying that it would not open
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:59.920]   to stop the influence of Western Christianity into the underground church.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:04.920]   They said that the Western Christianity was beginning to hurt the underground church.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:08.920]   So as you guys know, recently, during the pandemic and after the pandemic,
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.920]   Christianity basically have been weeded out by the government.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.920]   So all the major mission organizations have been chased out.
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:18.920]   There are missionaries still there, but they're not connected to any big organization.
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:22.920]   So the whole Western community has been concerned about this country.
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:27.920]   They said, "We're not able to support them. We're not able to train them."
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:33.920]   But then the recent report that's been coming out of China is that the underground church is thriving.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:39.920]   They are thriving without the Western influence, without the Western training.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:46.920]   And so obviously, the prayers of the underground church has been answered above ours.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:52.920]   We have a tendency to think that because we have money, because we have training, because we have school, we have know-how,
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:58.920]   that somehow if we can spread our version of Christianity, revival will break out.
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:01.920]   Power is not concentrated here.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:06.920]   You see more power in remote villages in India,
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:11.920]   in parts of the places where they have very little representation of Christianity.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.920]   And every once in a while, we are privileged to interact with them.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:24.920]   We come back with a clearer sense of what Christianity was meant to look like in those villages than what we experience here.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:29.920]   If you read the Bible and compare what the Scripture says about what Christianity ought to be,
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:38.920]   and you compare with our average experience of Christianity here, it doesn't even look the same.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:42.920]   But when you're over there, everything that it says, this is what it must have looked like.
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.920]   This is what Christianity must have looked like in the first century.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:50.920]   This is what pastor's life must have looked like. This is what they were going through.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:59.920]   In fact, all through Scripture, we are warned that when you are comfortable, that you do not forget God.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:04.920]   Deuteronomy 8, 10-11, as God is preparing the nation of Israel to enter into the Promised Land,
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:11.920]   He says to them, "When you have eaten and are satisfied, you shall bless the Lord your God for the good land which He has given you.
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:17.920]   Beware that you do not forget the Lord your God by not keeping His commandments and His ordinances and His statutes which I am commanding you today."
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:23.920]   The primary thing that God was concerned about the nation of Israel is that when their prayers are answered,
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:28.920]   and they have eaten, and they have been satisfied, that they would forget God.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:35.920]   And that's exactly what happens in Hosea chapter 13, 6 as they are taken into captivity.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:39.920]   God describes the reason why Israel falls.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:43.920]   Hosea 13, 6, "As they had their pasture, they became satisfied.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:50.920]   And being satisfied, their heart became proud. Therefore, they forgot Me."
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:53.920]   Now, when He says, "They forgot Me," does that mean that they were worshipping idols?
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:58.920]   Did they have ball worship and asherah polls in their homes? No.
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:06.920]   In the book of Amos and Isaiah, it tells us that they were very busy sacrificing, and singing, and gathering.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:10.920]   But in the midst of that, God says, "I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice."
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:19.920]   And in the knowledge of God, then burnt offering. What you are doing is religious activity, but there's no genuine worship.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:25.920]   Israel fell by two countries, the Assyrians and the Babylonians.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:32.920]   The captivity in Assyria and Babylonia couldn't have been more polarizing.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:39.920]   Assyria came in, threatening them, killing them, chopping off their limbs to scare the nation of Israel into submission.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:44.920]   Babylonians, on the other hand, gave them privilege.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   They integrated them into Babylonia, and they allowed them to have a good life.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:56.920]   And if you look carefully in the scripture, the world is not called Assyrians.
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.920]   The world is called Babylonians.
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:05.920]   The primary way that the church falls is not through persecution.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:11.920]   It's through comfort. It's through peace. It's through wealth.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:21.920]   Christianity in the United States has become so intertwined with the health and wealth gospel, even in strong Bible teaching churches,
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:32.920]   it has become so compromised that what we consider to be a blessing from God doesn't look anything different than what the world pursues.
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:37.920]   When we get good jobs, when somebody is sick and they become healthy, when we make good investment,
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:43.920]   when good things happen, which is no different than the eyes of the world, that that's a blessing from God.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:49.920]   And then when we get sick, we make investments, things that we don't want happening in our life,
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:54.920]   and all of a sudden we say, "Where is God? How come God is not answering our prayer?"
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:52:02.920]   Again, we have become so intertwined with the deception of the world that even in Bible teaching, Bible studying,
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:08.920]   that our sense of reality of what God has called us to doesn't look anything like what we see in scripture.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.920]   This is why he says, "Devote yourself to prayer."
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:18.920]   Be devoted to prayer, be devoted through prayer, and then he says, "You must be sober."
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:25.920]   You must be sober in prayer. The word "sober" is to be watchful, to be alert.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:31.920]   In the book of Ezekiel, God calls Ezekiel a watchman.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:41.920]   Watchman is basically a person that has been set aside on the wall, and his whole job is to stay awake and to watch.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:49.920]   If that man falls asleep, whatever danger that may be coming, he's not able to warn.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:54.920]   They say, you know, the pastors are to be sober, the missionaries are to be sober,
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:53:01.920]   the elders and the leaders are to be sober, and we have a tendency to applaud those who lead and to be sober.
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:08.920]   But you are called, every single Christian has been called to be a watchman, to be sober, to be prayerful,
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:15.920]   because there are your children, your family, there's people around you that we don't have any access to,
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.920]   that you are responsible for.
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:24.920]   Matthew 26, verse 41, it says, "Keep watching and praying that you may not enter temptation.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:28.920]   The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:33.920]   Jesus said that to his disciples as he was resting in prayer before he went to the cross.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:39.920]   I know your heart, I know your desire, that your spirit is willing, but your flesh is weak.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:49.920]   He says you must be sober and pray, because you have no idea how committed your enemy is for your downfall.
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:54.920]   Your enemy is stronger than you, your enemy is more organized than you,
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:59.920]   your enemy is more determined than you, and your enemy is more persistent than you.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:06.920]   If you knew that there was somebody, even one person, with equal strength,
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:13.920]   not more powerful than you, with equal strength, and his determination is to bring you down,
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:21.920]   walking around in your neighborhood, my guess is that knowledge would keep you sober.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:28.920]   Well, our enemy is more determined, more powerful, more cunning.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:34.920]   And he says he's like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour, and he is constantly scheming.
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:38.920]   That's why Jesus says, "Even though you are willing, your flesh is weak."
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:44.920]   You have no idea what kind of enemy that you are against.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:50.920]   You feel safe because you have a ring camera on your door?
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:58.920]   You feel safe because you got a gun, and you practice to become a marksman, expert,
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:03.920]   trained all your children and your wife to handle a gun well?
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:07.920]   Nothing wrong with any of that. We have the freedom in this country.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.920]   But your enemy is not outside your door.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:18.920]   The primary enemy that can bring us down are not going to be threatening you with guns.
[00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:22.920]   They're not going to be at your door banging to come in.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:29.920]   The enemy that we were warned about is already in your house, is already scheming.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:36.920]   There's not a single person in this room who has not fallen, to some degree, even right now,
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:43.920]   into the enemy's scheming, because you may have justified certain sins in your life,
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:49.920]   and you don't know that you fell to the scheming of the devil.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:55.920]   And so, if you're not aware of the enemy's scheming in your life, and just how powerful and determined he is,
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:56:01.920]   and you feel safe where you are because you live in a big house, because you got a big gun,
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:08.920]   and you've been working out and building your muscle, and you have enough money put away as a safety net,
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:14.920]   you have no clue. You have no clue what battle you're in.
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:19.920]   He says you must be awake and pray and be devoted to prayer.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.920]   You don't know how weak and susceptible you are.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:27.920]   In Philippians 3, 3-4, it said, "For we are the true circumcision who worship in the Spirit of God,
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:31.920]   glory in Christ Jesus, and put no confidence in the flesh."
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:35.920]   And that's the problem of Western Christianity.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:40.920]   Because we have resources, because we have money, because we have education, because we have know-how,
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:46.920]   we automatically think that if we apply ourselves, that revival can break out,
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:49.920]   that we can somehow disciple people into the kingdom.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:54.920]   If we just set them a good example, not realizing the power is not in us.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:57.920]   Paul says, "We have no confidence in the flesh."
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:01.920]   That doesn't mean that what we do doesn't matter. It matters.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:04.920]   But that's not where the power lies.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:08.920]   And that's why he says, first and foremost, to pray.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:13.920]   If you just study the Bible without devoted prayer, it will ruin you.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:17.920]   If you evangelize without devoted prayer, it will ruin you.
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:22.920]   Because you're going to come to believe that it was because of your know-how, because of your articulation,
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:27.920]   because you figured out some way to get a non-Christian to agree with you,
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:33.920]   that if you apply that method of what you come to say that it works,
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:36.920]   that somehow that that's what God's been waiting for.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:42.920]   God's been waiting for some clever, smart, devoted people to figure out how to do this.
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:47.920]   And so now that we've applied our money, we've applied our know-how and our technology,
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:50.920]   now God can finally bring revival.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:52.920]   God is waiting for us to get out of the way.
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:56.920]   God is waiting for us to realize just how susceptible we are,
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:01.920]   and that we have no confidence in our flesh so that He can intervene.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:05.920]   That's why wealth has a tendency to ruin the church,
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:10.920]   because it makes us proud, because we live in comfortable homes,
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:15.920]   we have wealth in our bank accounts, we don't have a sense of urgency.
[00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:23.920]   That's why we see more power in a village who has no training, very little, seminaries,
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:28.920]   and yet we are more aware of the power there than here.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:32.920]   You have no idea the trials that are coming your way.
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:39.920]   Mark 13:33, "Take heed, keep on the alert, for you do not know when the appointed time will come."
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:44.920]   You may not feel the need to stay sober today.
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:48.920]   You have no idea what's coming around the corner.
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:56.920]   You know, what I found is the greatest test of your commitment to Christ is time.
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:59.920]   Time.
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:03.920]   When you feel urgent when you're young, you get older,
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:06.920]   you get used to going to church, you get used to going to Bible study,
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:10.920]   you get used to paying bills, you get used to serving the church,
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:16.920]   and after a while you think that, "Is this it? Is this it?"
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:20.920]   And everything becomes boring because it's become routine.
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:26.920]   And a sense of urgency and desperateness to cling to Christ begins to die.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:32.920]   And you just do what you're supposed to do, you just do it day after day,
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:37.920]   and you don't remember the last time you cried out for the lost.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:42.920]   You don't remember the last time you grieved for those around you who aren't Christians.
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:47.920]   You don't remember the last time you felt unsafe because you didn't pray,
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:49.920]   because it's become so routine.
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:54.920]   And the Christianity that we have accepted looks nothing like what we see in Scripture.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.920]   And the problem is not that you're there.
[00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:03.920]   The problem is that you're there and you're okay with it.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.920]   1 Peter 4:7, "The end of all things is near.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:11.920]   Therefore be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer."
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.920]   You must be sober to pray.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:17.920]   1 Thessalonians 5, 5-6, "For you are all sons of light and sons of day.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:23.920]   We are not of the night nor of the darkness, so let us not sleep as others do."
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.920]   Let us not behave like the world.
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:29.920]   Let us not hope like the world hopes.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:33.920]   Let us not rejoice and be sad over what they're sad over
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.920]   and rejoice over what they rejoice over.
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.920]   We are not like the world.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:43.920]   If Christ comes tomorrow, how will your life change?
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:48.920]   If you had one year to live, all the things that you're concerned about,
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:54.920]   all the things that you're anxious about, all the things that you are working so hard to get,
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:59.920]   when your life is done, will it matter?
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.920]   Will it matter?
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:08.920]   So much of our time and effort and energy is poured into things that don't matter.
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:12.920]   In Matthew 24, 38-39, Jesus says, "For as in those days before the flood,
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.920]   they were eating and drinking and marrying and giving to marriage
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.920]   until the day that Noah entered the ark.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.920]   They did not understand until the flood came and took them all away.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:22.920]   So will the coming of the Son of Man be."
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.920]   You notice here, he says, before the judgment came,
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:28.920]   that Christ is going to come like a thief in the night.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:32.920]   And the reason why, he doesn't say they were idolatrous and sexual immorality
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:33.920]   and all these things are true.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:40.920]   He says they were eating and drinking and marrying like everybody else.
[01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:42.920]   They had no clue.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.920]   What they valued, what they celebrated, what they became sand over,
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:50.920]   what they pursued was no different than the world.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:53.920]   What is so simple about eating and drinking?
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.920]   What is so simple about being married?
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:06.920]   At the end of the day, the things that we grumble over doesn't matter.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.920]   It has no eternal value.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.920]   It's because we have become lulled to sleep.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.920]   We have become deceived.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:20.920]   The things that matter so much to us has no value in eternity.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.920]   It's because we have been deceived.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.920]   In fact, in 1 Corinthians 10, 1-5,
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.920]   he said all of the Israelites went into the desert,
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:30.920]   and they saw the power of God, the miracle of God.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.920]   They ate the miracle bread.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:38.920]   And yet, he says, most of them, God was not pleased.
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:39.920]   They couldn't enter the promised land.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:43.920]   And the reason why he gives in 1 Corinthians 10, 6-10, it says,
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.920]   "Now these things have happened as an example for us
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.920]   so that we would not crave evil things as they also craved.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.920]   Do not be idolatrous as some of them were, as it is written,
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:56.920]   the people sat down to eat and drink and stood up to play."
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.920]   He's talking about all the reasons that God can give
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.920]   why these people did not enter the promised land.
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.920]   He says, "The idolatry in their heart was
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.920]   they were eating and drinking and playing."
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.920]   Eating and drinking and playing.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.920]   That's what caused them to drift away from God.
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.920]   Eating and drinking and playing.
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:21.920]   Now, it's not sinful.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:26.920]   But even the way we ask questions about God's will, is it sin?
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.920]   Is it sin to do this?
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.920]   And the answer, obviously, is not sin.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.920]   Because the Bible doesn't spell it out to be sin.
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:38.920]   But the fact that we live our lives, as long as it's not sin,
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:42.920]   as long as I'm not going to be prevented from going to heaven,
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:46.920]   then I'm going to live it up until I die.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.920]   You have been deceived.
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.920]   You have been deceived.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:59.920]   Because you don't understand the value of what it is that we have in Christ.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.920]   At the end of the day, the worst thing that can happen to a Christian
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:05.920]   is that he gets sick and dies early.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.920]   And if you're a parent, the worst thing that can happen
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:11.920]   is that your children get sick and die early.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:16.920]   But if you're a child of God, the worst-case scenario
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:20.920]   is that we get to be glorified earlier than other people.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:28.920]   The tragedy in this world is a rich man, a famous man, a comfortable man,
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:33.920]   who has enough possession to take care of his family for the next 10 generations,
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.920]   and yet he dies without Christ.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:39.920]   That's the greatest tragedy.
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:43.920]   So if a Christian is not living his life with that perspective,
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.920]   he has been deceived.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:49.920]   He has been deceived to value what is temporary, worthless,
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.920]   more than what is eternal.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:55.920]   And that's what wealth has a tendency to do,
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:59.920]   and that's why he says you must be sober to pray.
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.920]   You must be sober to pray.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:05.920]   Not only do you need to be sober to pray, he says you must be thankful.
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:09.920]   Nothing kills sober praying than a grumbling spirit.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:12.920]   In 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18, it says,
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:16.920]   "Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks,
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:19.920]   for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus."
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.920]   You may look at that and say there's three imperatives here to rejoice always,
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.920]   pray without ceasing, and give thanks.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:30.920]   But these three imperatives, you cannot practice one without the other.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:35.920]   Even in the world, when somebody wins a lottery or they win the Super Bowl,
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:39.920]   and oftentimes even non-Christians would say,
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.920]   "Thank God that God blessed me.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.920]   Thank God for this money. Thank God for this investment.
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:48.920]   Thank God that my child was sick and now he answered my prayer.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.920]   Thank God."
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:55.920]   There's thanking, there's rejoicing, and there is communication with God.
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.920]   Even non-Christians do that.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.920]   But it's very circumstantial.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.920]   Christians do that.
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:06.920]   Just like the world, when something good happens.
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:08.920]   When somebody was sick and they become healthy.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.920]   You're looking for a job and you got a good job.
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:13.920]   You made an investment.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.920]   Good things happen to you.
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:18.920]   But from a Christian sober perspective,
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:22.920]   every single one of us who deserved eternal damnation
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:25.920]   met the living Christ.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:29.920]   Every single one of us, the blood of Christ, the Son of God was shed for us
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.920]   so that we can have eternity with Him.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.920]   There is not a single second in a Christian's life
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:42.920]   that when he is sober should not be thanking God for his very breath.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:46.920]   The only reason that we are not rejoicing, we are not praying,
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:52.920]   we are not thanking is because we have been entangled with this world.
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:58.920]   And our value system has been intertwined with this world.
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:01.920]   That's why he says to rejoice always, pray without sin.
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:03.920]   How can you rejoice always?
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:06.920]   Because rejoicing is not based upon your circumstance.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.920]   How do you give thanks in all circumstances?
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:10.920]   You don't know what's going on with you.
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:14.920]   Because giving thanks is not based upon your current circumstance.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:21.920]   Rejoicing and thanking and praying is based upon what Christ has already done for you.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.920]   That's what worship is.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.920]   You don't worship God because you won the lottery.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:30.920]   You don't worship God because you're healthy and your kids are safe.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.920]   We worship God because of what He has already done.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:38.920]   And that's why He can command us, always pray, always give thanks,
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:45.920]   always rejoice when you are sober and you are aware of what you already have in Christ.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:47.920]   Philippians 4, 6, and 7, "Be anxious for nothing,
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:53.920]   but in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God."
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.920]   Be anxious for nothing.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.920]   Not only for those things that you can't handle.
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.920]   Not only in dire situations.
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.920]   But he says, be anxious for nothing.
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:07.920]   He says the reason why you're anxious is because you haven't prayed.
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.920]   That's what he said.
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:12.920]   Be anxious for nothing, but in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving,
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.920]   let your requests be made known to God.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:17.920]   And the peace of God, which surpasses human understanding,
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.920]   will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:23.920]   You know why praying gets rid of anxiousness?
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:26.920]   Because if I pray, no matter what circumstance I am in,
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:32.920]   if I pray and leave it to God and ask God to have Your will be done,
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.920]   whatever is going to happen, I let it go.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.920]   I let it go.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.920]   The reason why we're anxious is because this needs to happen.
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.920]   This needs to happen.
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:48.920]   So we're anxious, if I pray, will God fix this?
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:49.920]   No.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:53.920]   If we pray, "Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven,"
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.920]   then this doesn't have to be.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.920]   It can be the opposite of that.
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:03.920]   What, worst case scenario, in my mind, may happen,
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:06.920]   but as long as I release it and say, "Your will be done,"
[01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:09.920]   then I no longer have to worry.
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:12.920]   It's because we have determined what our desire is,
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.920]   and we're trying hard to bend God's will toward my will,
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:20.920]   so when my will is not done, we become anxious.
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:24.920]   Whether it's job, circumstance, people, whether I'm married or not married,
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:28.920]   have children or not have children, our anxiousness comes
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:35.920]   because we're concerned that God will not bend His will toward mine.
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:40.920]   If we pray with soberness, and we pray with faith,
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:44.920]   and we surrender our will to His,
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:50.920]   it automatically eliminates anxiousness
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.920]   because His will will be done, whatever that may be.
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:54.920]   Now, why do we need to pray soberly?
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:56.920]   Why do we need to pray with thanksgiving?
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:58.920]   Why do we need to be devoted to prayer?
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:02.920]   Is it simply so that our lives would be better?
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:06.920]   Because our lives is hard, and so we need to be devoted to prayer?
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:08.920]   That you didn't get the job because you weren't devoted?
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:11.920]   Your family, you're having relational problems because you were not devoted?
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:14.920]   Is that why He tells us to pray?
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:19.920]   Why do we need to pray with soberness?
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:22.920]   Because somebody's going to break into your house?
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:25.920]   Because the wrong politician is going to get into the office?
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:29.920]   Why do we need to be sober so that we can pray?
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:33.920]   Why do you need to be thankful when we pray?
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.920]   So that we can have joy in our life and not to be anxious,
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.920]   just focus on the positive instead of the negative?
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:43.920]   Is that why He tells us that we need to be devoted and sober and be thankful
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.920]   so that we can pray?
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:47.920]   No.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:52.920]   It's because what we need to pray for requires it.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:54.920]   What we need to pray for.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:11:00.920]   He says, "Pray at the same time for us as well, that God will open to us a door for the Word,
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:04.920]   so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ, for which I have also been imprisoned,
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:07.920]   that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak."
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:11.920]   We need to be devoted to prayer, to be sober in prayer, to be thankful in prayer,
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:18.920]   so that we can be the light that God called us to be.
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:24.920]   So that we can recognize if we are being deceived to think that we're going to be here forever.
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:30.920]   That if somehow, that if you don't meet the right husband at the right time,
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.920]   that somehow your hopes and dreams are going to be dashed to the floor.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:37.920]   That if you don't have a child, a boy and a girl,
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.920]   if you don't have the right job, if you don't have certain health,
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:44.920]   if you don't have a certain type of friends,
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:47.920]   that that's possibly the worst possible scenario.
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:54.920]   If you've been somehow deceived that your value looks no different than the values of the world,
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:12:02.920]   the only difference is the means for your joy is through Christ.
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:07.920]   And it doesn't look any different than a Buddhist, or a Muslim, or Jehovah's Witness.
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:16.920]   It's just that the one you pray to, to get it, has a different name than you have been deceived.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:24.920]   Christ did not come so that you may have a comfortable ride while judgment comes.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:29.920]   Christ came primarily to save us from judgment himself.
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:35.920]   He is our joy. He is our life. He is the way.
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:46.920]   Our primary call, why we need to stay sober, is because our primary call to life here on earth is to be the light.
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:55.920]   Wouldn't it be easier for you if you accepted Christ and you died, just like the thief on the cross?
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:03.920]   I believe you, Lord. And then when you come and get baptized in the water, you never come out.
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:09.920]   If it kept you in there and you died, wouldn't your life be easier?
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:13.920]   You don't have to worry about raising children. You don't have to worry about—you're in heaven.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:21.920]   And we say that every time we're at a funeral. We remind them, "Your loved one is in a better place."
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:27.920]   And we're not exactly—it's not empty words because it's 100% true.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:38.920]   So then why are we here? So he can torture us? So he can see if we're going to make it or not?
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:42.920]   Why are we here? It's clear.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:47.920]   He said, "I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not be able to prevail against it."
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:53.920]   He said, "You are the light of the world." No one lights a lamp and puts it under a table.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:58.920]   He puts it on top so that the world can see. "You are the salt of the earth, and if it loses its saltiness,
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:10.920]   what purpose does it serve?" What purpose does a church serve if all we are concerned about is ourselves?
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.920]   All we are happy about is ourselves. All we grumble about is ourself.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:23.920]   I'm not comfortable. I don't like this. I don't like that. What good is it?
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:28.920]   It would have been better if we died when we met Christ.
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:35.920]   The reason why you and I are here is so that as Christ came to seek and save the lost,
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:42.920]   that we may also deny ourselves, pick up our cross, and join him.
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:46.920]   A disciple of Christ is not simply because you study the Bible.
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:51.920]   A disciple of Christ is somebody who goes where Jesus goes, says what Jesus says,
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:55.920]   and does what Jesus does. That's a disciple.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:02.920]   Not simply somebody because you raised your hand because you said the right doctrine.
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:06.920]   Paul prays that the door may be opened. 1 Corinthians 16, 8-9,
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:11.920]   "I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost, for a wide door for effective service has been opened to me,
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:17.920]   and there many adversaries."
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:21.920]   One of the stories that we kept on hearing from the pastors in India
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:25.920]   is that because of this persecution, how do you bring the gospel to the lost?
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:28.920]   And there's one particular story that Pastor David,
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:32.920]   and if you've ever been to India and you met Pastor David,
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:34.920]   you know how introverted he is. He's quiet.
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.920]   His brother is the one who's always talking, and he's joking around with us,
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.920]   and Pastor David is always the quiet one in the back.
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:43.920]   He was the one who was halfway through his pharmacy school,
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:46.920]   and he said, you know, I was determined not to be a pastor
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.920]   because he saw what his dad went through and what they went through,
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.920]   sleeping on the field when they're being chased out.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.920]   He said, "I don't want to bring my children into that."
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:57.920]   And then he said, in the middle of his pharmacy school,
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:01.920]   he said he repented and he decided to follow Christ.
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:06.920]   And he also prayed, not only for himself, that if God gave him a son,
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:08.920]   that he would also dedicate him to the Lord.
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:13.920]   So he has an older son who's 16 years old who's prepping to go into ministry.
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.920]   And we asked him, "How do you handle going into these villages
[01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:20.920]   to share the gospel if they're so hostile?"
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.920]   And he just said, "I go in there and they kick us out,
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.920]   and we wait till they calm down, and they go back,
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.920]   and they kick us out, and then we go back."
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.920]   He said, "How many times?"
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:34.920]   He said, "Well, there's one village that he went to after he became a Christian
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:38.920]   to share the gospel because no Christianity has ever touched this area.
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:42.920]   It's in the top of a large hill, and it's very difficult to get to."
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:46.920]   And once he got there, he had to stay there for several months.
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:51.920]   And he said he went back and forth to that village over 12 times
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:56.920]   as they were kicking him out, hostile toward him, throwing rocks, beating him.
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:03.920]   He said eventually somebody came to Christ, and they were able to plant the church.
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:08.920]   Think about how rich people determine a wide open door.
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.920]   Do we have enough funding?
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.920]   Do we have enough support?
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.920]   Are they inviting us?
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:19.920]   Is there air conditioning if we're going to go?
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:22.920]   If we don't have what we're comfortable, what we're used to here,
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:25.920]   we say, "Oh, no, no, the door's not open."
[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:31.920]   Compare how they saw the door open and how rich people consider a door open.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:35.920]   And this is why Christianity is weak where we're at.
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:38.920]   Wealth is not evil.
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:45.920]   But if wealth blinds you, if wealth makes comfort a necessity,
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:53.920]   if wealth becomes a primary distinction between blessing and not blessing,
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:56.920]   then we have been deceived by wealth.
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:04.920]   We need to pray and engage the harvest because God has given us resource.
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.920]   You can use that resource.
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:09.920]   We can use that resource so that we can be comfortable,
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:14.920]   or we can use that resource for the purpose of gospel ministry.
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:16.920]   It is not wealth that is evil.
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:20.920]   It is the love of money that blinds us.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.920]   Let me read you one passage.
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:27.920]   1 Peter 3:15, "Sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts,
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:30.920]   always being ready to make defense to everyone who asks you
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:33.920]   to give an account for the hope that is in you,
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:37.920]   yet with gentleness and reverence."
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.920]   Let's pray.
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:46.920]   Father, as we begin 2025,
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:53.920]   open our eyes to see how desperate we are when we are not near you,
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:59.920]   how vulnerable we are when we are not clinging to you,
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:02.920]   when we're not devoted in our prayers.
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:05.920]   Help us to be sober. Help us to be thankful.
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:09.920]   Help us to be engaged, Lord God, in this dark world,
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:12.920]   that Christ's name may be exalted,
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:16.920]   that more and more of your elect may come to Christ.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:22.920]   Help us, Lord God, to be an extension of who you are, wherever we are.
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:28.920]   Help us, Lord God, in our weakness, that we may pray, pray, pray,
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:32.920]   that your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:34.920]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:37.920]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:58.920]   (soft piano music)
