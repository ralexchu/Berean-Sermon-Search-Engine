[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.540]   If you could turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 13, we're going to be looking at verse
[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:17.960]   15 and 16.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.040]   Hebrews chapter 13, verse 15 and 16.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.680]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.280]   Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is the
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.280]   fruit of lips that give thanks to his name.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.320]   And do not neglect doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.760]   Let's pray.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.720]   Heavy Father we pray that you would bless this time and that we would not turn from
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.760]   your word to the left or to the right, that we would neither add nor subtract from your
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.080]   word, that you would send it Lord God to soften, encourage, rebuke, and strengthen the hearts
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.520]   of men and women Lord God who have come to hear, asking for your grace in Jesus name
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.900]   we pray, amen.
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.680]   If you grew up in a Presbyterian church and they taught you the Westminster Catechism,
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.360]   you'll probably already know that the very first and the most important part of the Catechism
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.080]   begins by this question, what is the chief end of man?
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.080]   Chief end of man.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.960]   So this is the first thing that you learn in the Catechism when they ask you what is
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.720]   your purpose in other words?
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.960]   What is the most important thing that God desires of us that we should be pursuing?
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.200]   And the answer to that question in the Catechism is man's chief end is to glorify God and to
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.200]   enjoy him forever.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.080]   His chief end.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.640]   Not to say that that's the only end but it's the most important thing that we are to pursue.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.040]   Now, basically this is the summary of everything that we're trying to do.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.680]   Whether you're a Presbyterian or not, the Catechism basically summarizes for us what
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.680]   is important.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.760]   Why are we saved?
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.080]   Why are we here?
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.240]   Why do we study the Bible?
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.840]   Why do we pray?
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.160]   Why did Christ suffer?
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.400]   What is the point of eternity?
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.440]   All of it is summarized in that statement.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.800]   Man's chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.720]   It's to praise him, to magnify him, to worship him.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.880]   C.S. Lewis on this reflection of praise where he kind of shares how he was really hung up
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:37.400]   on this idea of how in every other instance where we are told to humble ourselves, Jesus
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.920]   says that he who is the greatest in the kingdom of God is the one who serves, who is the least.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.120]   If you want to live, you have to learn to die.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.840]   And yet when it comes to God, he says to glorify him, magnify him, to worship him and worship
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.840]   no other.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.160]   And so he kind of, he had a difficult time understanding this.
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.040]   And this is the reflection that he found on this subject.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.080]   C.S. Lewis says on a reflection on Psalms praising God, it says, "The most obvious
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.600]   fact about praise, whether of God or anything, strangely escaped me.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.040]   I thought of it in terms of compliment, approval, or giving of honor.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.120]   I had never noticed that all enjoyment spontaneously overflows into praise.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.440]   The world rings with praise, lovers praising their mistresses, readers their favorite poet,
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.720]   walkers praising the countryside players, praising their favorite game, and etc."
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.280]   And so the point that he's trying to make is when we see it from our perspective is
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.660]   like, oh, God wants to praise, he wants to be honored, he wants to be put on a pedestal.
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.000]   But in reality, what God is basically saying, the chief end of man is to glorify God and
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.360]   enjoy him forever, is that our appreciation, our restoration of this relationship would
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.840]   lead to an abundance of joy that leads to praise.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.300]   And that's exactly what Jesus says when he says in John 10, 10, that I have come to give
[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.620]   life and to give this life abundantly.
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.940]   That life there isn't bios, isn't just eternity, because according to Scripture, everyone has
[00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.880]   eternity.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.900]   Whether you have eternity in heaven, whether you have eternity in hell, the Bible says
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.380]   everyone has eternity.
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.200]   He didn't come so that we would have eternity.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.880]   He says he came so that we may have joy, to be alive.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.480]   And again, whenever you think of being alive, you're talking about joy, you're talking about
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.160]   praise.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.680]   And so Jesus says that he came to give us this joy, this life.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.760]   John chapter 4, 23, when Jesus is interacting with the Samaritan women, Jesus summarizes
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.920]   their conversation, and he says, there's going to come a time whether you worship in this
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.960]   mountain or that mountain, it's not going to matter.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.800]   What he's looking for, what he's searching for, are people who will worship him in spirit
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   and in truth.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.360]   The true worshipers are what he is seeking.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.640]   The whole point of salvation is because we lost the ability to worship when we rebelled
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.040]   against God.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.620]   The Bible described it as us falling short of God's glory.
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.580]   So the whole point of salvation is to restore us so that we may reflect that glory again,
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.380]   to be true worshipers.
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:23.120]   So discipleship, discipleship is to make worshipers of God.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.120]   Discipleship isn't simply going out, sharing the gospel, and people who didn't go to church
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.120]   to come to church.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.020]   It's not people who didn't read the Bible to read the Bible.
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.680]   If you didn't pray, for you to pray.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.720]   The whole purpose of salvation is to get people who couldn't worship God to be worshipers
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.560]   of God.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.880]   You can have people who are very diligent, very disciplined, very active in pursuing
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.480]   holiness and not be in worship of God.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.980]   The Bible makes it very clear.
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.640]   That is his primary passion, that is his primary pursuit, and that's the primary thing that
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.120]   he is looking for in us.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.880]   Are we true worshipers?
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.380]   The text that we're looking at this morning in verse 15 and 16, there are four things
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.160]   that I want to highlight about true worship that he seeks.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.440]   First thing is, worship is what Jesus came to restore.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.140]   Worship, first and foremost, is what he came to restore.
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:27.400]   When we think of salvation, sometimes we think of salvation as not dying, not going to hell.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.480]   We imagine what heaven would be like, but the primary thing that Jesus says is that
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.440]   he came to restore proper worship.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.840]   In 1 Peter 2 verse 9, it said, "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:48.360]   nation, a people for God's own possession, so that the reason why Jesus did everything
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.640]   that he did is so that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who has called you out
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.000]   of darkness into his marvelous light."
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.680]   Everything that he's done for us, everything he's given us, the reason why we belong to
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.000]   him is to make us worshipers of him again.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.400]   Whole reason why you and I have been created was to bear his image, to reflect his glory,
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.960]   to praise and worship him.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.480]   But because of our rebellion, because of our sin, we've fallen short of that glory.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.800]   So the whole reason why Jesus came, and that's why he says, "Through him give praise."
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.640]   That was the whole purpose of the book of Hebrews.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:34.200]   For 13 chapters, we've been talking about the excellencies of Christ, supremacy of Christ
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.800]   over everything, and to don't take your eyes off of who Jesus is.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.440]   But the point of that is not simply to save us from judgment.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.360]   The point of it is to restore us into proper worship.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:54.760]   Isaiah 43 verse 19, it says, "The people whom I formed for myself will declare my praise."
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:02.640]   Over and over again, God says in deliverance of Israel, in bondage, they're in anguish
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.640]   and they're crying out to God, and Jesus, I mean, God raises up Moses and he sends Moses
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.560]   to Pharaoh, and he says this repeatedly over and over again.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:18.080]   The reason why I am sending you, the reason why I'm demanding, why Yahweh is demanding
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:25.560]   Pharaoh to let my people go, he says, is so that they may worship me.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:31.360]   And he repeats that same phrase over and over again through Moses, Exodus 7, 16, 8, 1, verse
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:37.040]   20, chapter 9, verse 1, 13, chapter 10, verse 3, verse 7, chapter 28, verse 41, chapter
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:42.200]   29, verse 1, over and over again, the same phrase.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.520]   Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.960]   He didn't say, let my people go because they've suffered enough.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:57.880]   Because if you remember, once they got delivered and they were in, they were in the desert,
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.480]   they experienced hunger that they didn't experience out in Egypt, even though they had a hard
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.200]   life and they started grumbling and complaining.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.920]   Oh, when we were there, at least we didn't have to worry about that.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.180]   Even though our life was hard, we didn't have to worry about the people trying to kill us,
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.620]   these enemies.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.760]   And when they got thirsty, they said, oh yeah, we never ran out of water over there.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:23.640]   See, but God never said to them, let my people go so that they can drink, let my people go
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.640]   so that they can eat.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.360]   He said, let my people go so that they may worship me.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:36.040]   So the primary reason why Israel was established and why Israel was delivered and chosen was
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:42.000]   for the same reason why you and I have been chosen, is so that we may worship him.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.040]   In fact, in every scene that we see in the Bible, where we see the throne of God, what
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.680]   you and I are going to see when we die and are in heaven, is described in this way.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:58.440]   Isaiah 6, 2, 3, Isaiah sees the throne of God and says, "Seraphim stood above him, each
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.440]   having six wings.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.840]   With two he covered their face, and with two he covered his feet.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.000]   And with two he flew, and one called out to another and said, 'Holy, holy, holy is the
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.760]   Lord of hosts, the whole earth is full of his glory.'"
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.600]   They were worshiping him.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.120]   That was the scene that they saw.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.320]   In fact, every scene that we see of heaven, it's a scene of worship.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.480]   Revelation chapter 7, 11, "And all the angels were standing around the throne and around
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.680]   the elders of the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.280]   and worshiped God."
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.880]   Now, it was not forced.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.120]   It was spontaneous.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:43.240]   Because when they were in the presence of God's glory, the natural response was they
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.620]   broke out in worship.
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.160]   The first response was fear and terror.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.360]   But the second response from fear and terror is to worship God.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:58.800]   See, when we are separated from God's glory, what you and I are not able to do is to worship
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.500]   God.
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.640]   But because Jesus took away the barrier and he covered us with his blood, now we are able
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:13.760]   to be in the presence of this God and to see his glory and break out in worship.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.400]   So the whole thing that he says, "Through him," the reason why Jesus did what he did
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:22.160]   was that through him, we could praise him.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:28.900]   Because praise is where we find our life, where we find the greatest joy.
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.520]   We end up worshiping whatever brings the greatest joy in our life.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.800]   And it's not a burden.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.680]   We look forward to it because that brings true life.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:43.960]   So the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian is what he worships.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.320]   I think some of you know that I'm not a fan of Disneyland.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.520]   I don't know if I made that very clear.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.240]   Let me make that very clear.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.600]   So I'm not saying objectively that no one can go, that this is a place of sins, purgatory.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.240]   I'm not saying that it's like that for you, but it's like that for me.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.480]   So when I think of Disneyland, I don't have happy thoughts.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.800]   Endorphins don't kick in.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:10.000]   I think of expensive churros, hot sun.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.600]   I think of teenagers getting out of line, three-hour lines to ride a 15-second roller
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.600]   coaster.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.600]   That's what I think of.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.420]   And then you have to pay, what, $800 to get in now?
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.120]   So when I think of Disneyland, those aren't happy thoughts.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:31.480]   That's something that you do to please somebody else.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.200]   But I know some of you guys don't feel that way.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:41.040]   You guys go there and you spend your money, you spend all day hurting yourself in the
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:49.520]   sun, emptying your pockets, eating $15 churros, and then you come out and then you calculate,
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.480]   "When can I go again?"
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.240]   I don't understand that because it doesn't bring joy.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.240]   It doesn't.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.720]   The thought of it gets me tired.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.000]   But some of you fantasize about, "When's the next time I can go?"
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.560]   Because that place brings happiness to you, right?
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:12.360]   And you're willing to sacrifice, whatever it is that you're willing to go there because
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.640]   it's a place that brings Zoe to you to some degree.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:21.280]   See, the Bible says that true life is found in Christ.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.880]   Jesus says, "I am the way and the truth and the life.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.640]   No one comes to the Father but through me."
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:36.800]   Through him, we're able to be restored into true life where we find true joy.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.760]   And when that joy is restored, we have true worship.
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:47.360]   And so that's what he means by he is pursuing people to restore them back into the purpose
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.440]   in which God created us.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:59.320]   See, the greatest benefit of our salvation is a new life that he has given us so we're
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.440]   not tripped up in this trivial things.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.240]   And that's our primary struggle, isn't it?
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.580]   Sometimes we forget what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:15.060]   And because we forget what it is that we have in Christ, we let trivial things become the
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.440]   source of our joy.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:21.240]   And when that seems to be threatened, we get anxious and we worry and we compromise in
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.080]   order to have that.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:28.920]   But the whole purpose of our salvation is to open the gate so that we can get to the
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.960]   God that gives us true life.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.960]   That's what he means.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:39.320]   The whole purpose of all of Hebrews, in fact, the whole purpose of the whole Bible is to
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:46.360]   open the gate and to come in so that we can experience this life.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:52.160]   So worship is exactly what Jesus came to give us, restore to us.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:58.080]   Number two, worship is not circumstantial, but it's continual.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:03.020]   That's what it says in verse 15, "Let us continually offer up sacrifices of praise to God.
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.360]   That is the fruit of lips that give thanks to his name."
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.800]   You know, in the Old Testament, God had major sacrifices in the book of Leviticus.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.680]   You had the whole offering, you had the sin offering, peace offering, the guilt offering,
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.680]   the grain offering.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.800]   And so these are all offerings that God commanded the nation of Israel.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.520]   You cannot approach God without the whole offering, the burnt offering, because that
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.680]   offering represented atonement.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.360]   So every time they approached God, they were reminded, "You are sentenced to be atoned
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.360]   for."
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.840]   And all of this to point to the true atonement that was coming in Christ.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.100]   But it was mandated.
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.680]   And then there were offerings that were freewill offering.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:47.440]   When things are happening, you're thankful to God and out of free gift.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.640]   It was not mandated.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.080]   But whenever certain things happened, maybe you had a great harvest or God answered prayer,
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.320]   for whatever the reason, you would voluntarily give your offering.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.080]   And thank offering was part of that.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:08.040]   So whenever they were overflowing in thankfulness, they would bring that to God voluntarily.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.200]   But the thing is here, it's commanded.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.240]   What was voluntary then, he said, it's commanded.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.680]   In 1 Thessalonians 5, 16 to 18, he says, "Rejoice always."
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.480]   How can he command us to rejoice always?
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:28.240]   Does he not know that sometimes there's suffering in our lives?
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.760]   Does he not know that I don't have a job and I don't know where the next paycheck's coming
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.760]   from?
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:38.880]   Does he not know the relational problems that I'm having with my wife or husband or my children?
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.800]   How can he tell us to rejoice always?
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.840]   It's almost seems like God's indifferent.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.080]   He doesn't know our suffering.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.400]   How can that be commanded?
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.440]   Offer up, he says, to pray without ceasing and in everything give thanks.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.200]   In everything.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:58.160]   He doesn't qualify when you feel thankful.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.000]   When things are going well, he says, in everything.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.400]   Now, Apostle Paul is writing this church where people were being beaten for their faith.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.800]   He actually had to get out of this city.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.440]   I mean, remember Apostle Paul?
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.440]   You remember who he is?
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.640]   This is a guy who lives in Lystra.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.080]   He gets stoned, dragged out of the city.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.600]   And then the only reason why they didn't kill him is because they thought he already died.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.080]   This is a guy who was not afraid to die.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.720]   He gets back up, gets back into Lystra and preaches the gospel.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:35.000]   People are praying and prophets are telling him, don't go to Jerusalem because they're
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.800]   going to capture you there and you're going to be in prison.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.680]   He says, not only am I willing to go to prison, I'm willing to die.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:45.440]   So this is not a coward.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.960]   Thessalonica is almost the only city that we know where Apostle Paul hurries up, packs
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.360]   up his bags and he leaves.
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.080]   The reason why he leaves is because persecution was so intense.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.200]   It wasn't for himself.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:00.840]   He was concerned for the Christians who converted there.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.320]   To protect them, he leaves.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.200]   That's how intense the persecution was here.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.880]   And the whole reason why this letter was written is because he was concerned after he left
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.080]   that they would have destroyed them.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.680]   That's the background behind 1 Thessalonians.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:20.760]   And it is that letter, within that letter he says to rejoice always, to pray without
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.680]   ceasing, in everything give thanks.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:29.440]   For this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.720]   Think about all the things that we wrestle with about God's will.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.720]   Is it God's will for me to marry this guy or this girl?
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.800]   Is it God's will for me to go to this school or that school?
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.560]   Is it God's will for me to have this business or that business?
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.040]   And we're always seeking the Lord's will.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.040]   We seek counseling.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.040]   We read books.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.040]   We hear sermons.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.440]   What is the Lord's will?
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.160]   Well, God didn't spell that out.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.720]   He didn't spell out that these people are to be engineers, these people are to be businessmen,
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.200]   these people are to do this.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.600]   He doesn't spell that out.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.120]   He gives us the choice.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.240]   Make a wise choice that honors and glorifies God.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.840]   But here he says this is God's will.
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.800]   And he makes it Christy clear.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.040]   What is God's will?
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:16.940]   Our praise, our rejoicing, our thanksgiving, constantly.
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.800]   Because it's not based on circumstance.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:24.040]   In Philippians chapter 4, 6 it says, "Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:28.020]   supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God."
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.360]   This is the go-to text whenever we're anxious, right?
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:36.120]   Whenever we get stuck, whenever we have problems, it's like be anxious for nothing, but in everything
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:41.720]   by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.840]   And the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.840]   Jesus.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.280]   So if you've memorized this verse, you probably repeat that, meditate on this constantly.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:55.560]   But you notice here where thanksgiving is mentioned?
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.680]   Is it before or after you pray?
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:07.320]   Because typically we would think thanksgiving happens as a result of answered prayer.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.440]   Be anxious for nothing, right?
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.280]   With everything by prayer and supplication let your requests be made known to God.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.600]   And when God gives you the peace, make sure you give him thanks.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.820]   He doesn't say that.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.040]   He says approach him with what?
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.240]   Thanksgiving.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.440]   Thanksgiving is before the prayer is answered.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:25.800]   So our thanksgiving is not contingent upon answered prayer.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:31.100]   He says to have the right heart to come before God with thanksgiving in your heart.
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:35.360]   So clearly thanksgiving is not circumstantial.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:41.560]   Thanksgiving is not dependent upon what's happening around us.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:47.320]   Luke chapter 10, 17 to 20, when he is sending out the 70 disciples and Jesus says this to
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:53.160]   them, "The 70 returned with joy and saying, 'Lord, even the demons are subject to us in
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.600]   your name.'
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.800]   And he said to them, 'I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.940]   Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions and over the power
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.480]   of the enemy, and nothing will injure you.'"
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.760]   Let me stop right there.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.880]   Wouldn't you break out into praise if demons were subjected to you?
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:16.320]   If even power is that you can go out, get bit by scorpions, they're not going to hurt
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.320]   you.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.720]   Like what?
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.760]   But he qualifies that and he said, "You're going to see powerful things.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.920]   You're going to have power over these demonic, you're going to cast them out.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.800]   You're going to see miracles."
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:35.040]   But he qualifies this, he said, "Nevertheless," verse 20, "do not rejoice in this, that the
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:41.920]   spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven."
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.240]   It's not circumstantial.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:48.560]   He qualified all of that in rejoicing in everything, praising in everything, because our peace,
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:58.600]   our joy, our praise is not based upon answered prayer in our circumstance.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.880]   Happiness is not having what you want.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.360]   Happiness is wanting what you have.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.080]   It was on some clock in my house.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.520]   I didn't quote the Bible.
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.200]   I think it's biblical though.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:22.040]   Happiness is not wanting what you have, but having what you want.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:30.680]   See, as Christians, he said, "Our joy and our praise does not change because of circumstance."
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.360]   Because the Bible says that everything that we need for a life of godliness has been given
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:38.080]   to us in the knowledge of his son, Jesus Christ.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:43.240]   So the peace that he gave us, he said, "It's a peace that the world cannot give you, and
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.300]   it's a peace that the world cannot take from you."
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:51.120]   So therefore, our rejoicing, our thanksgiving is based upon our eternal security that we
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.120]   have in him.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:56.340]   He says, "Don't rejoice because of the temporary things that you see.
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.120]   Rejoice that your name is written in heaven in eternity."
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:07.700]   So whether good or bad, when we have faith in God, we always have reason to praise.
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.480]   We always have reason to be thankful.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.680]   You know, after the sermon, we're going to sing this song, "Blessed Be Your Name."
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.120]   You guys probably know this song, but the song goes like this, "Blessed be your name
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.700]   in the land that is plentiful when your streams of abundance flow.
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.360]   Blessed be your name."
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:30.040]   That first line isn't uniquely Christian.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:36.800]   Even rappers who have vile lyrics, when they come and get their award, they said, "Thank
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.080]   the Lord."
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:44.240]   When people win lottery, even atheists, "Thank God."
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.640]   Movie stars, "Thank God for this blessing."
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.880]   That's not uniquely Christian.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.360]   What's uniquely Christian is the second verse.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:59.880]   Blessed be your name when I am found in the desert place, though I walk through the wilderness.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.360]   Blessed be your name.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.520]   Verse four.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:08.720]   Blessed be your name on the road marked with suffering, though there's pain in the offering.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.520]   Blessed be your name.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:17.400]   Sometimes having a lot of things become a hindrance to true joy.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:23.280]   True joy, we believe and we know that it's found in Christ.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.800]   And there's a reason why Jesus said it's hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.480]   It's easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.280]   It's because of the distraction, because of the temptation.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:40.880]   Because we naturally think that if I had that, if I had this, if my circumstance changed,
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.160]   if my relationship, if something changed, if my health was better, it would be so much
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.160]   better.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.160]   I'd be so much happier.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:53.400]   And that becomes a distraction to really seeing the true joy that we have in Christ.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:59.440]   I remember when I was back in college, you know, I had this janitorial job and I would
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.440]   work from 5 to 1.30, 2 in the morning.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:07.720]   And I remember one day I was coming out and I was driving home near Biola.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.720]   This is where it happened.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.360]   And I was driving home and I ran through a red light.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.040]   It was 2 in the morning, I was just tired.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.640]   And there were three cars on the road, 2 in the morning.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:19.920]   My car, the car I hit, and the cop behind her.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.840]   And so we're there exchanging phone numbers and all this stuff.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:27.320]   And I did have insurance through my parents.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.500]   But I was 19 years old.
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:34.060]   So they weren't satisfied with whatever settlement that they got.
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.720]   And so they started coming after my parents, but they realized that I wasn't 18, I was
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.320]   19, so they couldn't go after them.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.640]   So they started coming after me for three years.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.960]   Every few months I would get a letter from the lawyer, you know, this is what's going
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.120]   on, this is what's happening.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:52.840]   And then at the end they would, they sent me a final letter saying that we, the court
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:58.200]   demands that you list all your assets, because they're trying to sue me.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:02.640]   Well, I had $50 in the bank account.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.240]   And then I remember having this conversation with my roommates, because they were all about
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.000]   10 to 11 years older than I was, and I was asking them for advice.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.200]   Because the only thing I have is the $50 in my bank account, and I had this guitar that
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.760]   I was given as a gift.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.040]   And my guess is it was worth about 100 bucks.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.720]   It's like, do I need to put this on here?
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.560]   I said, I don't know.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:28.680]   So I put guitar and $50.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:32.520]   And I mailed it, put a stamp on it, and I sent it back.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:37.880]   And then the next email, or not email, the next letter that I got basically in summary
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.560]   in modern translation was forget it.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.100]   It's not worth it.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.160]   She probably regretted it for three years of pursuing me, you know.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:52.040]   I think she was waiting for me to graduate college and make some money, you know, and
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.160]   she didn't realize where I was.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:27:03.160]   I shared this story because it was so satisfying to not worry about losing anything.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.760]   In fact, right around that time, I was driving a Hyundai XL.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.760]   It didn't belong to me.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.760]   It belonged to my parents.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.360]   And I was driving it, and I was coming out of this parking lot.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:16.760]   You know one of those light poles in the parking lot, and it had a huge cement block to hold
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.760]   it?
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.000]   And if you get too close to it, you don't see the cement block.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.960]   So I was there, and I was driving out of the parking lot, and I didn't even see it.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:28.560]   So I was revving to get out, and I smashed my car into that.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.160]   And it wasn't a slight dent.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.440]   It was in the middle of the car, and I hit it hard.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.680]   And oh my gosh, what was that?
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:39.120]   I came out, and the car was dented in, and I couldn't even drive it because the whole
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.600]   frame got bent in the middle.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:45.480]   So I had to call the tow truck, took it to the garage, and they said, man, what did you
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.480]   do?
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.480]   Right?
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.480]   What happened?
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.480]   It was an accident.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.480]   Yeah, so what happened?
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.480]   I hit a pole.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.480]   Like by yourself?
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.480]   Yeah, by myself.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.680]   I hit the pole.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:59.060]   So basically they said, in order to fix this, we need to get a machine and pull the body
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.480]   back out and get it in the frame.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.640]   And this is Hyundai Excel, brand new.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.640]   It's probably like $4,500.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:07.760]   And they were saying it's going to cost $2,000, $3,000 to fix all this.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.560]   So basically the car got junked.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:15.440]   And I remember coming home from that, my roommates picking me up, thinking like, man, now I really
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.440]   have nothing.
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.440]   Right?
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.440]   I have nothing.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.440]   What am I going to do?
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.440]   How am I going to get by?
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.080]   I don't have a car.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.040]   And so that was my first thought of anxiousness of what am I going to do.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:31.080]   And then, weirdly, there was a sense of peace.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:35.040]   Like, now I have nothing holding me back.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.480]   I literally have nothing in my name.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.760]   And for some reason, initially, it brought anxiousness, but I was happy.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.560]   People would think I'm crazy that I'm thinking that.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.560]   But I just remember, and even I couldn't understand it.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.160]   Like, why are you happy?
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.680]   Because I had nothing.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:57.960]   I mean, the thought of having nothing was very freeing.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:05.800]   I share this story because I remember at that time thinking that all the pursuits that we
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:12.520]   give so much attention to is such a great hindrance oftentimes.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:16.320]   And we pursue it because we think that that's going to make us happy.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:20.360]   That if we have that, a bigger house, a nicer car, a better job, better retirement, and
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:25.320]   we pursue that because we think that if we had that, if we visited this, if we ate that,
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.740]   that that's going to cause happiness.
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:31.560]   But the very thing that we think is going to cause happiness is a source of frustration
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.120]   in our life.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:39.320]   And so I remember at that moment just having nothing, just being free.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.880]   I could literally come before God and say, "Here am I.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.880]   Send me."
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.480]   I can have an earthquake hit and have the house burned down, and all I have to do is
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.240]   pick up my sleeping bag and go somewhere else.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.040]   And that thought just was freeing.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:56.480]   See, our joy and our praise is not based on circumstance.
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:57.480]   It's not based on friendship.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:05.880]   It's not based upon community or health, but what we have that the world cannot take away.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:11.200]   Thirdly, worship involves more than what we do on Sunday.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:16.520]   In Hebrews chapter 13, verse 16, it says, "Do not neglect doing good and sharing."
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.320]   So worship is more than just singing.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.520]   Worship is more than just putting in our time.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.980]   Our actual act itself is an act of worship.
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:28.120]   The word "Liturgo" in our Bibles are translated oftentimes as worship.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.880]   There's three prominent words in the Greek that's translated worship.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:32.880]   First word is "proskoneo."
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:38.600]   "Proskoneo" is to be prostrated before God, to be bent over in worship.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:43.280]   So most of the time you see the word "worship" in the New Testament, it's that word "proskoneo."
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.080]   The second word is "sabomai."
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:48.560]   "Sabomai" means a sense of reverence and respect.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.720]   So it's what's happening internally.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.120]   The third word is "liturgo."
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.740]   "Liturgo" oftentimes in your Bible is translated "serve."
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:01.440]   And sometimes in your translation, it'll be translated as "worship," because that's exactly
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.000]   what that word means.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.840]   "Liturgo" means the actual physical act of carrying out something as an act of worship.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:15.680]   So sometimes that word is described when priests are in the temple, at least in the Septuagint,
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.000]   the Greek translation of the Old Testament, where they are performing these acts as an
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.120]   act of worship.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:28.320]   Sometimes in the New Testament, it's translated as an act of giving, serving, living in obedience.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:32.480]   And Romans chapter 12, verse 1, it says, "Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God,
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:37.920]   to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.660]   service of liturgo."
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:42.800]   Spiritual service of liturgo.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:50.360]   So worship is not simply just what we do here, singing, listening, attending.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:57.360]   Everything we do can be an act of worship.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:05.200]   I think the struggle that we get into is when we are doing things simply out of obligation,
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:12.920]   Jesus and God becomes a taskmaster, because we want to be serious Christians.
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.000]   We want to be good Christians.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.680]   And so what do good Christians do?
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.360]   They read their Bible.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.360]   They pray.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.360]   They give.
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.360]   They serve.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:29.400]   But do you ever notice that the people who are the most bitter and angry after a while
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:33.320]   are the people at one point who used to serve the most?
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.040]   At one point in their lives?
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.040]   They gave.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.040]   They served.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.040]   They sacrificed.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.040]   They made disciples.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.040]   They prayed.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:44.120]   And at the end of that, it turns into bitterness.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.160]   Like, how come nobody's helping me?
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.160]   And they don't, they didn't get the praise, or whatever it was that they were looking
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.160]   for.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.880]   And then they become bitter and angry.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:58.560]   So the people who served the most, gave the most, end up becoming the most antagonistic
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.200]   for the very thing that they pursued.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:05.040]   What God wants is not simply our service.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.560]   What God wants from us is worship.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:14.240]   And so when we do things out of worship, it produces greater joy.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.120]   Just like Disneyland.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:24.360]   And I think of that, if I go to Disneyland, right, because somebody made me, that's torture.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.360]   Right?
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.240]   That's eight hours.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.920]   And I paid for this.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:36.200]   Standing in the sun, my knees swelling up, surrounded by kids cursing.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.520]   I mean, I could give you a list in my head.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.880]   And at the end of that, I don't come out singing and dancing.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.320]   I don't, I come out, never again.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.880]   And somebody, can you do it again?
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.120]   Oh my, again?
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.920]   I gotta do this again?
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:56.600]   See, that's religion.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:03.240]   That's when somebody is trying so hard to appease a taskmaster, and realizing that you
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.840]   can't ever really appease him.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:11.160]   And so you're constantly living and serving out of guilt, out of accountability, in order
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.160]   to belong.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.280]   Because reward isn't Christ.
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.680]   Reward is belonging here.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.640]   Reward is praise from other people.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.040]   But eventually, it's not enough.
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.920]   And that's exactly what was happening with Mary.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.880]   Mary, it wasn't that that she was serving, but the serving led to grumbling.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.000]   I mean, Marys are great.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.600]   Marys are the one who keep the church going.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:36.440]   Marys are the one who are staying late, and show up early to clean up the church.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:41.240]   But the problem with Mary wasn't that she was serving, but that her serving led to the
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.240]   grumbling.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.240]   Sorry, Martha.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.240]   I used the wrong name.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.240]   Mary's the good one.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:52.240]   You guys are all staring at me like, "Were you in the same Bible?"
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:56.840]   I meant Martha, Martha.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:05.600]   Even in our worship, even in our service, God wants us to do it out of act of worship.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:11.840]   You notice when new Christians come in, and they're just happy to be here?
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.240]   They're happy to come to church.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.240]   They're happy to sing.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.480]   They're happy to serve.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:22.720]   And at the end of all their service, they ask, "Oh, anything else that you need?"
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.720]   Versus people who've been weighed down by sacrifice.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:31.120]   They've been working so hard, sacrificing so much more than anybody else.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:37.520]   And the constant state is grumbling.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.240]   Worship is not taking place.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:46.040]   The call for Christians is to make other worshipers.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:50.480]   Not people who are more disciplined, not people who simply read the Bible more, more organized,
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.280]   and work harder, and sacrifice more, and love people that you can't love, and I'm going
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.400]   to be a really good Christian.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.400]   No.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:02.240]   The people we're pursuing are other worshipers.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.200]   In Psalm 23, verse 5, it said, "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.800]   You have anointed my head with oil.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.400]   My cup overflows."
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:18.120]   You ever put too much coffee or whatever in your cup, you know what I mean?
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.800]   And it's too hot, and you can't drink it, so you got to move it from wherever it is
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.160]   to another place?
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.920]   What usually happens?
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.960]   It'll overflow.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.880]   And if somebody else has that, you don't want to be near them because you know you're going
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.320]   to get splashed.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:36.480]   So you kind of walk gingerly, try to keep it in the cup, but it always ends up overflowing,
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.840]   right?
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:41.600]   That's how our praise is described.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.600]   It overflows.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.400]   My cup overflows.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:53.240]   You know the best way to evangelize is to have our cup overflow, to have our cup overflow.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:59.960]   So you can come to church and sacrifice, and get up early in the morning, and serve people
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.200]   you don't want to serve.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:07.520]   Love people that you hate, but then come to church and love them anyway.
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:11.000]   Do you want Christ?
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.280]   Who would want to join that?
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.120]   That's not what he called us to do.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:22.280]   He said, "We've fallen short of the glory of the gospel of Jesus, glory of God."
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.400]   And then he says that, "The God of the saints has blinded the mind of the unbelievers so
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:29.520]   that they do not see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ."
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:33.960]   So the whole point of the preaching of the gospel is that through what Christ has done,
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:39.680]   through the preaching, through the sharing of the gospel, that their eyes may see what?
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:44.820]   Their sin, yes, but why do they need to see their sin?
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:49.200]   So that they can be cleansed of their sin, so that what?
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:53.820]   They can see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, so they can see his glory.
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:38:01.040]   So if all the gospel is, is God's going to get rid of your sin, that's not attractive.
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.840]   Yeah, we're not going to go to hell, but that's not the point of salvation.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:09.120]   The point of salvation is to come to Christ.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:15.020]   That you too may be able to see the glory of who he is, that you too may worship.
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:21.660]   And so the best way to make disciples of other people worshiping is to have our cup overflow.
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:28.580]   When our cup overflows, other people will catch that.
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:33.700]   Evangelism has to come as an overflowing of our heart of who God is.
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:39.060]   That this is not something that we do because you're supposed to do it.
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:43.340]   Like miserable people trying to make other miserable people.
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:49.980]   No, he said he came to give life and to give this life abundantly.
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:57.340]   The joy that he gave me, the worship, praise, peace that he gave me, that you also can have.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:02.320]   Fourth and finally, worship pleases God.
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:06.140]   In our generation, I've been hearing through the grapevine, through articles and different
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:12.100]   people saying that in order to bring more people to church and ease whatever guilt and
[00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:18.900]   shame that people may have, I've been hearing, it's like there's no way you can please God.
[00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.700]   You can only, only Jesus can please God.
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:22.980]   So there's nothing you do.
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:28.580]   So you don't need to feel guilty because God loves you just the way you are.
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:33.660]   The problem with that is that may apply in justification, but when it comes to sanctification,
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:34.820]   the scripture is very clear.
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:37.700]   God can be pleased and frustrated with us.
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:44.300]   Have you not read about the letters that is written in the book of Revelation?
[00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:49.540]   It's filled with things that God is pleased with, things that God is not pleased with.
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:55.780]   So yes, we can displease God, grieve the Holy Spirit, and we can also please God.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:40:00.740]   Here it says our worship, a life of worship, pleases God.
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.860]   It pleases him.
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:06.580]   In Hebrews chapter 12, verse 2, it says, "Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:11.860]   of faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross."
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.580]   Now what joy was he pursuing?
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:18.180]   What joy was worth his sacrifice and his suffering?
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.180]   His glory?
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:22.820]   Well, he said he gave up glory.
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:26.340]   Even though in every way he was equal with God, consider equality, we've got something
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.740]   not to be grasped, but he emptied himself, became nothing.
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:32.420]   So what is it that he was pursuing?
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:37.220]   What is it that he had after the cross that he didn't have before the cross, and it was
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:40.660]   that joy that he was pursuing?
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:41.660]   Me and you.
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:44.380]   Me and you.
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:50.460]   Our worship was the joy that he was pursuing.
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:53.940]   Our worship, our joy, our life is what he was pursuing.
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:58.380]   That's why it says, "He endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:01.660]   right hand of the throne of God."
[00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:08.860]   He sacrificed himself in order to pursue his joy so that you and I may have this joy.
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:14.940]   Spurgeon says this about this subject, "Dear brothers and sisters, be sure that you do
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:16.420]   not lose your joy.
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:21.300]   If you ever lose the joy of religion, you will lose the power of religion."
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:22.300]   Let me say that again.
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:26.700]   "If you ever lose the joy of religion, you will lose the power of religion.
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.840]   Do not be satisfied to be a miserable believer.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:36.220]   An unhappy believer is a poor creature, but he who is resigned to being so is in dangerous
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:37.460]   condition.
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:38.740]   Depend upon it.
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:42.980]   Greater importance attaches to holy happiness than most people think.
[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:47.140]   As you are happy in the Lord, you will be able to praise his name.
[00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:50.580]   Rejoice in the Lord that you may praise him."
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:56.140]   You notice here rejoicing and praise are intertwined?
[00:41:56.140 --> 00:42:00.840]   And we are rejoicing when we recognize what it is that we have in Christ that leads into
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:01.980]   genuine praise.
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:06.960]   John 17, 13, Jesus says, "But now I have come to you, and these things I speak in the world
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:13.720]   so that they may have my joy made full in themselves."
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:18.100]   He wanted us to have the joy that he has because of where he is.
[00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:21.780]   He wanted us to bring us to him so that we may experience that joy.
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:27.260]   Isaiah 62, verse 5, it says, "For as young man marries a virgin, so your sons will marry
[00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:28.580]   you.
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:35.340]   And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so your God will rejoice over you."
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:38.580]   Our God rejoices over us.
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:42.160]   So many people live their lives thinking he's a taskmaster watching to see if we're going
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.900]   to do the right thing.
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:50.600]   And yet the way that he describes our relationship is he rejoices over us.
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.600]   It gives him joy.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:43:01.220]   He pursued the cross and the shame ultimately to pursue joy, to see us come and rejoicing
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:05.100]   and experience this life that he wants us to have.
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:09.960]   So the primary thing that he's looking for, the primary thing that he rejoices over is
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:14.980]   our praise, our worship.
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:20.340]   If you've ever loved something so much that their happiness brings the greatest joy to
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:24.440]   you, you know exactly what we're talking about.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:28.460]   If you're a parent and you've raised children, you know what we're talking about.
[00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:30.620]   You don't even have to be a parent.
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:36.060]   If you love your wife or your husband, just seeing them happy makes you happy.
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:40.820]   Parents or maybe your friends, you could be a co-worker, or maybe you're leading Bible
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:45.320]   study and you've committed yourself to certain people and just seeing the joy that you brought
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:50.980]   to them gives you the greatest joy.
[00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.380]   Let me wrap up in this.
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:56.780]   I started with Disneyland, so let me end with Disneyland.
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.620]   I don't know if I made it clear.
[00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:02.020]   I'm not a fan of Disneyland.
[00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:07.360]   But I do have one very fond memory of Disneyland.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:12.140]   And I'm going to mention my nephew, Nathan.
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.900]   This was before all the rest of us had kids.
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:20.500]   And so Nathan was, I forget how old he was, but he was enough where he could run, but
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:21.900]   he wasn't able to articulate.
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:24.940]   But I remember we all decided to go to Disneyland.
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:28.480]   And obviously, I'm not a fan of Disneyland.
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.920]   But we went because of Nathan.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.820]   So actually, all of us went.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:39.620]   And so if you remember, if you know where Disneyland is, if you go into the gate, there's
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:46.060]   that outer part before you go into the tunnel where you suffer afterwards, you go into that
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.500]   tunnel, right?
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:51.460]   But before the suffering happens, there's that one little place where they have the
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:52.460]   flowers.
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:54.300]   You take the pictures and they have a shop there.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:57.220]   So we all got there and we're all waiting for people to come.
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:01.900]   And then so we get into that place and we're all standing on the side.
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:06.180]   And I'm gearing up for a long day of suffering.
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.900]   Well, Nathan kind of comes in.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:17.860]   He pops out of his chair and he just started running back and forth, just happy to be in
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:18.860]   Disneyland.
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:25.180]   Because he realized where he was and once he realized that, he just like, "Ahh!"
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.620]   And literally, I mean, he was just back and forth.
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:32.840]   I can't imagine another human being being that happy about anything, right?
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:36.300]   More happy than if your favorite team won the championship.
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.420]   I mean, at that age, I mean, he was just, "Yeah!"
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.940]   And he was back and forth, back and forth.
[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:46.980]   And I remember all of us just kind of like gearing up for this long day.
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:50.780]   All of us was filled with laughter.
[00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:54.380]   Just see him so happy that he was there.
[00:45:54.380 --> 00:46:04.220]   So that whole day was saved just from that.
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:08.500]   Words kicked in and it wasn't because I was looking forward to what was in there.
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:14.540]   It was seeing that just pure joy from that child at that age.
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:20.460]   All of a sudden, without a single word being spoken, that was worth that day.
[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:27.100]   I share that with you because that's how the Bible describes our salvation.
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:35.660]   That we've tasted the goodness of God and we're eagerly waiting to get into that gate.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:42.460]   That once we get in, that any bit of joy and happiness and praise and thanksgiving that
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:49.060]   we may have experienced here, the Bible says we've only experienced it in part.
[00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.580]   We're like children.
[00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:57.980]   We kind of imagine, but when Christ comes in his glory, we will be glorified with him
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:06.020]   and we will be in eternity celebrating and praising forever.
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:08.700]   That's salvation.
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.100]   That's why Christ came.
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:12.880]   That's why we worship.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.380]   That's why we pray.
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:16.980]   That's why we study the Bible.
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:22.100]   So as we focus this year in saying hope and pray, that prayer does not become another
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:28.900]   task, another discipline, but it was an avenue for us to express our thanksgiving to him,
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:36.340]   to commune with the only being that can give us that peace and joy.
[00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:42.420]   And all the distractions of our lives, that we would learn to see it as it really is,
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.900]   temporary.
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:49.420]   And to focus our eyes upon Christ, often perfect of our faith.
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:58.420]   Let's pray.
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:03.060]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for loving us.
[00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:06.060]   We thank you for saving us.
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:09.860]   I pray that our testimony would be the same.
[00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:14.100]   That our cups truly would overflow.
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:19.580]   That you would sanctify us, that we would learn more and more each week what it means
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:22.700]   to be worshipers who worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:29.420]   Help us, Lord God, to know this joy, that it may overflow in thanksgiving and praise.
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:31.940]   May Christ's name be exalted.
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:32.940]   In Jesus' name we pray.
