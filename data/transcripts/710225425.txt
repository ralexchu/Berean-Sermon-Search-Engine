[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.920]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 1.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.960]   Turn your Bibles with me to Luke chapter 1.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.360]   I'm going to be reading from 17 through 25.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.640]   Luke chapter 1, 17 through 25.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.720]   Reading the NASB.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.400]   Is he who will go as forerunner before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.280]   the hearts of the fathers back to the children, and disobedient to the attitude of the righteous,
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.320]   so as to make ready a people prepared for the Lord?
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.960]   Zachariah said to the angel, "How will I know this for certain?
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.400]   For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years."
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.520]   The angel answered and said to him, "I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God,
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.040]   and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.680]   And behold, you shall be silent and unable to speak until the day when these things take
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.080]   place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time."
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.720]   The people are waiting for Zacharias and were wondering at his delay in the temple, but
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.400]   when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.000]   vision in the temple, and he kept making signs to them and remained mute.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.760]   When the days of his priestly service were ended, he went back home.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.240]   After these days, Elizabeth, his wife, became pregnant, and she kept herself in seclusion
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.000]   for five months, saying, "This is the way the Lord has dealt with me in the days when
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.280]   he looked with favor upon me, to take away my disgrace among men."
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.080]   Let's pray.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:40.960]   Gracious Father, we pray that your word would speak to us, revive us, renew us, help us
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.480]   to have a clear vision of Christ, what he has done, who he is, what he has said.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.120]   May it all have a deep impression in our hearts, Lord God, in our lives, that we may continue
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.320]   to be sanctified according to your will and purpose.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.160]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:08.200]   You know, one of the benefits of being at our church, I think, is that there's an emphasis
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.000]   on the word of God, and I'm very encouraged to see so many of our church people who are
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.840]   engaged in the study of God's word, who come to the Bible study prepared, ready to engage,
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.720]   and so I believe if you're at our church, you are, again, not just at our church, but
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.560]   you are growing in knowledge of the word of God, and so there's a benefit that you know
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.000]   more and more about what the Bible says.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.120]   But the danger that also comes with being at a church where there's a heavy emphasis
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.040]   on the word of God is that you gain a lot of knowledge, and if you're not careful, one
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.400]   of the first things that happens to somebody where knowledge comes in is that you get puffed
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.360]   up, that you tend to think that you are more mature than you really are because you have
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.680]   more knowledge of God's word.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.120]   The power of the Bible is not knowledge, it's not you have more information.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.000]   Now information is important because not knowing what the word of God says, you can have passions
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.540]   that are not based on the word of God.
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.120]   You can have passionate feelings and opinions of things that's not based on what the word
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.000]   of God says, but the power of the word is not knowledge.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.880]   Power of the word is your faith, that when you hear the word of God, when you study the
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.440]   word of God, do you believe it?
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.280]   That's why Jesus says in John 11 when he was talking to Martha, he said, "For indeed we
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.400]   have had good news preached to us just as," oh sorry, "Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.400]   and the life.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.240]   He who believes in me will live even if he dies, and everyone who lives and believes
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.480]   in me will never die.'
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.080]   And he said, 'Do you believe this?'"
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.320]   Do you believe this?
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.700]   That's the important part.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.380]   Not did you hear it?
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.360]   Not can you recite it?
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.480]   But do you know the intricate theology?
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.760]   Because you know the hardest people to be around, the most difficult people to be around
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.200]   are people who throw out theology without affection for Christ.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.480]   They can quote scripture without knowing who Jesus is.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.520]   And all it does is puff up and the word of God just becomes a tool to examine other people's
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.520]   lives.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.000]   And it is a miserable person to be around when knowledge puffs up.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.400]   The power of the word is at the end of the study, do you believe that?
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.080]   Do you believe that?
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.360]   In Hebrews chapter 4, 2 it says, "For indeed we have had good news preached to us just
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.380]   as they also, but the word that they heard did not profit them because it was not united
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.560]   by faith in those who heard."
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.920]   So the difference between a Christian and non-Christian are those people who heard the
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.680]   word of God, who heard the gospel, and did they believe it?
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.840]   Did they actually believe it?
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.840]   And it's also true of sanctification.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.640]   Sanctification isn't simply behaving a certain way.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.060]   Sanctification is you hear the word of God.
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.240]   Every Sunday, every Bible study, you hear the word of God, but the next question after
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.440]   you've heard, after you've studied, after you've memorized is do you believe that?
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.760]   Because until you believe that, there is no change other than adding more knowledge.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.760]   There's no transformation taking place.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.140]   Your life doesn't look any different than what other people value, except your peers
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.400]   are in the church.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.840]   So because your peers are in the church, the pressure you feel is not from the world, but
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.440]   the pressure you feel is in the church.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.880]   So you try to compete with other Christians to be more knowledgeable, to be more godly,
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.220]   to know the Bible more.
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:53.280]   And so you conform to all of this because you're trying to move up the recognition
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.700]   ladder in the church.
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.960]   But it's not breaking you.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.120]   It's not humbling you.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.600]   Your love for Christ isn't growing.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.280]   The way we look at eternity hasn't changed.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.040]   In fact, it's a miserable place to be when we have a church filled with people who are
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.640]   growing in knowledge without growing brokenness and affection for Christ.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.640]   Because the key to everything that we are learning is the question, do you believe it?
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.000]   Not do they believe it.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.240]   Not what do they say.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.120]   Who do you say Jesus is?
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.200]   Do you believe it?
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.840]   The text that we're looking at this morning in Zacharias' response and the angel Gabriel's
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.560]   response to Zacharias' unbelief gives us some insight as to not only what God does with
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.680]   them but how God deals with us.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:51.240]   It says in Luke 1 17, after he gives his prophesy, this old couple answer prayer for them and
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.960]   through them answer prayer for the nation of Israel that their Messiah would come and
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.960]   deliver them.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.620]   Zacharias said to the angel, how will I know this for certain for I am an old man and my
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.080]   wife is advanced in years.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.200]   Now we can understand why Zacharias had a hard time believing this.
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.360]   Because he was already advanced in years.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.360]   Humanly it's impossible.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.320]   He wasn't simply tweaking certain things.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.160]   He's saying something supernatural is going to happen.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.880]   It's like how am I going to know this?
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.760]   And on top of that God hasn't spoken through a prophet for over 400 years.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.400]   So this was not a regular occurrence in the nation of Israel.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.080]   Every priest that went in there to burn incense didn't come out speaking to the angel.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:36.200]   There are 400 years of dead silence and then finally when he speaks he says something supernatural
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.200]   is going to happen.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:43.000]   So we understand that other human beings, why he had a hard time believing this.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Now this is not new.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.480]   If you look at redemptive history we see men and women whom God has chosen because of their
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.800]   faith to work mighty things and yet they themselves struggled with this.
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.280]   Remember Abraham?
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.940]   God calls him out.
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.380]   He walks out to the desert risking his life, family's life, all because of the simple promise
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:08.080]   that God made that if you follow me I will make you a great nation, I will bless you
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.400]   and all the other nations will be blessed by you.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:16.720]   And yet if you look at Abraham's life as he was wandering and following God, remember
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.600]   there are periods when he was so scared for his own life that he would lie about his wife
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.440]   and say hey make sure that you say you're my sister.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:30.640]   And so we see a fragile man, even though there was a man of faith, he was a fragile man just
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.640]   like us.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.280]   Remember Sarah?
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.120]   Finally when God says that they're going to give him a son just like he promised, remember
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.360]   how she responded?
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.360]   She laughed in unbelief.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.920]   And as a result God says your child is going to be named laughter just to remind you how
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.920]   you responded.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.380]   Do you remember Gideon?
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:55.100]   How God raises up Gideon and that he was going to dwindle down his army to a few hundred
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:01.920]   people to overcome tens of thousands Midianites and Gideon's response is like well how am
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.480]   I going to know that you're really going to do this?
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.760]   So he says send out a fleece and it's going to keep it dry and he's like to prove like
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.480]   God telling him wasn't enough.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.160]   It's like prove yourself.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.360]   He struggled with doubt.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.320]   Remember Hezekiah?
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.600]   When they he was a prophet that came that he was going to die and then he pleaded with
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.820]   the Lord and then he asked God like how am I going to know this is going to happen?
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.820]   Can you show me a sign?
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.240]   He said well can you make the sun stop or to move forward?
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:38.080]   And so we see this pattern repeated through mighty men.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:44.980]   Men who are supposed to represent faith at certain periods of time they doubt.
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:50.800]   If we're honest with ourselves we're no different.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.600]   I think the greatest struggle that we have is faith.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.340]   Sometimes our faith feels so small.
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:04.240]   Even as we say we believe, even as we profess, even as we surrendered our life to Christ
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:10.520]   from time to time we feel like our faith is no bigger than a mustard seed.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:16.880]   I mean just practically speaking when we see Matthew 7 7 it says ask and it will be given
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.880]   to you.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.880]   Seek and you will find.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.880]   Knock and it will be open to you.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:26.560]   I mean we memorize that passage and we teach that to Sunday school.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.520]   But the power of that passage is not that do you know this passage?
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.160]   Have you memorized this passage?
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.760]   Have you dissected this passage?
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.960]   Have you exegeted this passage?
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.520]   Have you preached this passage?
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.000]   The power of that passage is do you believe it?
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.800]   That if you seek you will find.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.920]   If you knock you will open.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.220]   If you ask you will answer.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.700]   Because if you believe it you would pursue.
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:52.700]   You would ask.
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:53.700]   You would knock.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:11:01.120]   And the reason we struggle with that is because we hear it but it's not coupled with faith.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.120]   You guys know that passage.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:07.120]   Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.120]   You know that passage.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.440]   If you grew up in Sunday school you may have memorized that passage.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.680]   But the power of that passage is not do you know it?
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.680]   Did you memorize it?
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.180]   Did you tell other people about it?
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.900]   But do you believe it?
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:26.220]   That if you seek his kingdom, if you put his kingdom first that God will take care
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.640]   of all the other stuff.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.400]   How much of our lives is flipped the other way?
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.580]   If I take care of all the other stuff and I'll leave the stuff that I can't do in
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.900]   God's hands.
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.760]   The reason why we live like that is because we profess this, we teach this, we exegete
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.200]   this.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.320]   But when we ask do you believe it?
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.520]   We don't have confidence.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.400]   We struggle.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.540]   He who finds his life will lose it.
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.780]   He who loses his life for my sake will find it.
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:03.080]   We know that's the fundamental thing that Jesus taught.
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.200]   And when he was going to the cross he said you must also pick up the cross and follow
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.200]   me.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.200]   Deny yourself.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.080]   This is the fundamental thing that is taught in discipleship.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.760]   But again the power of these words is not do you know it?
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.140]   Have you heard it?
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.140]   Can you exposit it?
[00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.880]   Do you know the context of it?
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.040]   But the question is do you believe it?
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:30.800]   Do you believe that if you live your life to make something of yourself you will lose
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.640]   it?
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:39.040]   Do you believe that all the pursuits of life so that you can have a better life here that
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.800]   you're pursuing something that eventually is going to ruin your life?
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:50.560]   Do you believe that forfeiting all the temptations of the world will actually lead to greater
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.620]   life?
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.000]   Do you believe that?
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.860]   Not do you know that?
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.500]   Have you studied that?
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.500]   Memorized that?
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.500]   But do you believe that?
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.160]   Because if we believed it our life would change.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.160]   Our pursuit would change.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.320]   We struggle with that.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.040]   Finally in Romans 8.32 it says he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.560]   another soul how will he not along with this give us all things.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:24.320]   Think how inconsistent our faith is from week to week to sing songs about God himself took
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.580]   on human form and he gave himself while we were yet sinners.
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.920]   He died for us.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.920]   How will he not?
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.080]   If you believe and we sing we memorize and we preach the gospel to other people that
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:40.600]   this is what God has done for us and yet day to day we struggle with does God really care?
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.000]   Is God actually listening?
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.140]   Is he really going to take care of my needs?
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:52.520]   And so we work hard to take care of all this other stuff and then only the things that
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:58.340]   we feel like we have no power over we just kind of hand it over to him.
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:02.520]   So again the power of these words is not do you know it?
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.520]   Have you studied it?
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.520]   Did you exegete it?
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.760]   Did you memorize it?
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.100]   Have you taught other people about it?
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.860]   But at the end do you believe it?
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:15.560]   Do you believe it?
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:23.160]   In response to Zacharias' doubting the angel says in verse 19 I am Gabriel who stands in
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:28.320]   the presence of God and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.000]   Now for us we say oh I am Gabriel what does that mean?
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.360]   A Jew would have immediately understood when he says I am Gabriel because the Bible actually
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.920]   only names three angels.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.520]   Number one Archangel Michael and again they're not everywhere but when you look him up Archangel
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:51.360]   Michael is the chief angel and whenever you see Archangel Michael appear in the Bible
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.880]   he's in some kind of battle.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.480]   He's the one fighting with the dragon in the book of Revelations.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.160]   He's the one who is gathering the other angels and basically going to war, spiritual war.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.400]   That's Archangel Michael he's the chief of the angels.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.320]   The other angel that's mentioned in the Bible is Lucifer.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.460]   Lucifer basically was a worshiper.
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:15.220]   He was the chief worshiper in God's creation.
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:21.600]   But instead of worshipping God in the context of worship he was trying to get worship himself.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.080]   Just like you know he was a great worshipper.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:30.800]   Imagine if you met the best worship leader that you've ever met in your life and he is
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.440]   trying to get attention for himself as he is worshipping.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:41.460]   So he may be the most skilled but he's the least person that you want up there.
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.400]   And that's exactly what Lucifer was.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.160]   Lucifer's rebellion is that he wants worship for himself.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:53.120]   Isaiah 14, 12-14 it says, "How you have fallen from heaven, O star of morning, son of dawn.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.660]   You have been cut down to the earth.
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:59.160]   You who have weakened the nation, but you said in your heart, I will ascend to heaven.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.920]   I will raise my throne above the stars of God and I will sit on the mount of assembly
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.400]   in the recess of the north.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.320]   I will ascend above the heights of the clouds.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.400]   I will make myself like the most high."
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.160]   And that's Lucifer.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:16.480]   So you have the Archangel Michael who is in conflict with Lucifer.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.680]   Typically we think God is in conflict with Satan.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.840]   That the good and the bad.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.560]   That God is good and Satan is bad.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.400]   Satan is under God's sovereign control.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.220]   Every time Satan, Lucifer needs to do something, he has to get permission from God.
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.640]   The conflict that the Bible describes is a conflict between Archangel Michael.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:40.200]   In fact in Jude chapter 9 it says, "But Michael the Archangel, when he disputed with the devil
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.960]   and argued about the body of Moses, did not dare pronounce against him a railing judgment
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.360]   but said, 'The Lord rebuke you.'"
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.600]   So the two other angels that are mentioned in the Bible is Archangel Michael who is in
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.520]   conflict with Lucifer.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:01.880]   So the only other angel that is named in the Bible is Gabriel.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:06.720]   Gabriel appears in Daniel chapter 8, Daniel chapter 9, and he's the one who is sent as
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:13.560]   a messenger to interpret the dreams that was coming through the people at that time.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:22.340]   And so Gabriel is widely understood in the Jewish community as the messenger of God.
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:30.940]   So when Zachariah hears when he says, "I am Gabriel," I mean he would have known immediately.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:38.060]   My guess is he probably was floored, was to the ground, was like, "Oh my gosh.
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.060]   Gabriel is here."
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:45.880]   That's what he means because the promise, the promise of the angel is only good as the
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.820]   one who is promising.
[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.520]   That's why we have credit scores, right?
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:56.420]   Like if your credit is like 500 or 400, you signing a name on something doesn't mean a
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.420]   whole lot, right?
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.300]   Because you just don't have good credit.
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.720]   So when he says, "I am Gabriel," in other words he's saying, "I am the one who stands
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.100]   in the presence of God."
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:13.260]   In other words, what he's saying, what I am saying to you is from God himself.
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.100]   That's how he answers his doubt.
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.720]   I am Gabriel.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.860]   I am the one sent from God.
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.260]   That's exactly what happens.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:26.300]   Remember when Moses asked the Lord in Exodus chapter 3, "When you send me to Pharaoh and
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:32.060]   to the Israelites, who are you to demand that my people be set free?
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.380]   What do I say to them?
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.380]   Tell them what?
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.620]   'I AM has sent you.'"
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.900]   You're not going with your authority.
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.380]   You're not speaking on your behalf.
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.780]   I didn't choose you because you are the most articulate.
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.440]   I didn't choose you because you are the greatest leader.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.140]   Tell them, "I AM has sent you."
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.320]   The power comes from the sender, not the messenger.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:59.240]   So when Gabriel says, "I am Gabriel," the one who stands in the presence of God is speaking
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:07.220]   to you, he says, "That should confirm for you."
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:12.460]   You know, typically we ask ourselves in the end, when I said the power of everything that
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:16.820]   we're studying is at the end, "Do you believe this?"
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.740]   Not "Do you know this?"
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.700]   Nobody cares what you know.
[00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:22.700]   Let me say that.
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.380]   Okay, does it sound harsh?
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.100]   Nobody cares what you know.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.140]   Let me say it one more time, right?
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:39.700]   Nobody cares what you know if it fills you with pride.
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:48.540]   If what you know doesn't lead you to point to a greater Christ, nobody not only cares
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.260]   what you know, nobody wants to hear what you know.
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:56.400]   The question is, "Do you believe this?"
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.580]   Do you believe this is the Word of God?
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.980]   That God is speaking to you?
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.900]   What do you say?
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.140]   Who do you say Jesus is?
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.560]   Do you believe this?
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:12.220]   You know, the typical way that somebody would dismiss the Word of God, if you've ever tried
[00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.860]   to evangelize and say, "Oh, the Word of God."
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.620]   They say, "I don't believe the Word of God because it was written by man."
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.620]   Right?
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:18.620]   Have you heard that before?
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:24.060]   That's a common argument against this being the Word of God.
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.540]   "Oh, the man put it together.
[00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.700]   The church put it together."
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:32.220]   And so if the church put it together, if man wrote it, it can't be divine.
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.820]   That's usually the argument that you will hear.
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:35.820]   I like what R.C.
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.340]   Sproul says about this subject, and he says, "The reason we doubt the Word of God is not
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:44.820]   because His Word is unbelievable or not credible, but because we project unto God the trustworthiness
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.460]   that describes our own condition.
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:51.140]   Let every man be a liar, but God's Word is true."
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:56.100]   The reason why they put forth that if it came through human hands, we don't trust it because
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.140]   we don't trust man.
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.020]   We don't trust each other.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.460]   Man doesn't have good credit.
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.740]   That's basically what he's saying.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:12.340]   Second Peter 1, 16-21, Peter, James, and John sees the transfiguration, hears the audible
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:18.740]   voice of God, and God appears and says, "This is my Son in whom I am well pleased."
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.260]   But God tells him, Jesus tells him, "Don't say anything yet because it's not time."
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.460]   But this is how Peter describes that incident.
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:29.200]   "For we did not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you the power and coming
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.680]   of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.780]   For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, such an utterance as this
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.980]   was made to Him by the majestic glory.
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:44.460]   This is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased, and we ourselves heard this utterance
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.340]   made from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain."
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.140]   He's talking about the transfiguration.
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.180]   Can you imagine that impact that it must have had on him?
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:58.140]   He sees the transfiguration and he says, "Don't tell anything."
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.380]   And then he finally gets to tell people, "Man, you know what I saw.
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:04.940]   I actually heard the audible voice of God."
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.820]   We've been walking with Jesus, but His glory was veiled.
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:15.980]   But for the first time, that veil was lifted so we could see Him and God spoke to us physically.
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.620]   But look what he says, 19.
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.620]   So we have the prophetic word made more sure.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.620]   More sure than what?
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.100]   What he saw.
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.160]   More sure than what he heard audibly.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:33.180]   The prophetic word, "To which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:37.780]   dark place until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your heart."
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:38.860]   Rising in your heart through what?
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.460]   Through God's Word.
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:44.140]   But know this, first of all, that no prophetic scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:48.900]   for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.300]   spoke from God.
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:59.420]   He's saying God has not ordained miracles to bring you to Christ.
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:05.980]   God has not ordained supernatural audible hearings so that you can commune with God.
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:10.220]   God has not ordained miracles so that you can hear Him.
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:17.500]   He says God has ordained His very breath in the Word of God to make it sure.
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:24.220]   So the question that we need to ask is, do you believe that this is the Word of God?
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.340]   Do you believe it?
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:29.180]   Not are you studying it, not are you meditating on it, not are you telling other people.
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:35.540]   Not are you handling it accurately, but even before any of that, do you believe this?
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:41.820]   Do you believe that Jesus is the only way, truly the only way, that there is judgment
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:51.060]   coming, that the book of Revelation is not just some fairy tale, that hell is not just
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:24:01.100]   something that was written just to tickle our imagination, but it's real, that heaven
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:07.100]   is real, that Jesus Christ died for us, for me, is real, my sins have been washed away,
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:13.420]   it's real, that if you seek His kingdom first that all these things shall be added unto
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:19.340]   you is real, that He who did not spare His own Son but gave Himself up for us all, how
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:26.780]   will He not along with Him give us everything else, is real, if you truly believe.
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:33.220]   If you doubt, that's where your struggle needs to be.
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:38.380]   Part of the reason why there is so little attention given to the diligent study of the
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:43.620]   Word of God, I believe, is because we wrestle with faith.
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:49.500]   We don't really believe, or we struggle with belief.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:56.140]   I mean, if I told you that you got a letter from your favorite basketball star and it
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:02.460]   was seven page and it was written to you, my guess is you would take time to read it.
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:06.820]   If you don't like sports, it's completely irrelevant, right?
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.540]   Movie star, I don't know.
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.940]   Your favorite person, I don't know.
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:14.020]   The girl you love, right?
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:21.020]   That girl that you've been praying for so dearly has written in response, right?
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.740]   And you get that letter, right?
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.300]   And then you realize it's like six pages.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.300]   Six pages, I've got time to read that, six pages?
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:34.460]   If you responded like that, I would say, "Ah, you're not interested."
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:39.140]   Your natural response would be, "Only six pages?"
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.380]   You comb through that letter.
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.420]   What does she mean by hello?
[00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:47.860]   Look at the big letters, right?
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:52.420]   Why is there a comma there?
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.420]   XOXO.
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:58.940]   And you would examine every part of that letter because every part of that letter is personal
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:01.460]   to you.
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:09.020]   If you believe that this is God's Word, that God wrote it to you, to talk to you, to bring
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:16.500]   you to Him, to tell you how much He loves you, the warnings that He gives you, to tell
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:25.220]   us what it's going to be like after we die, to tell us where the power lies, to tell us
[00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.220]   about our children.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:30.140]   I mean, it's been given to us.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.300]   But our struggle is, do we believe?
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.780]   Do we actually believe that?
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:40.900]   You know, sometimes, because we are raised in a church, we just assume we believe.
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:45.340]   Of course I believe it, and you just kind of give a knee-jerk reaction.
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:48.500]   But look at the way you respond to that, right?
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:52.260]   Because sometimes we can easily fool ourselves.
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:59.620]   I remember when I first became a Christian, the first person that I was so excited to
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.980]   share that I became a Christian was this co-worker.
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:08.940]   My dad used to work at this medical supply company, and as he was pastor, that was his
[00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:12.820]   side job, so during the summer, I went with him to work for about three months.
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:17.140]   And there was this one guy, one of his co-workers, in my mind, he was like the most sincere Christian
[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:18.140]   I've ever met.
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.060]   He always has his Bible.
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.220]   Every opportunity he had, he was reading it in between, and then every opportunity he
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.720]   got, he was sharing it with people.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:29.500]   So when I became a Christian, he's the first guy I wanted to tell.
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:34.100]   So he came to my mom's dry cleaner store, and I took a break because I wanted to tell
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.100]   him what happened.
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:40.060]   Because every break, he was trying to share with me about God.
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:43.100]   So I said, "Hey, he's going to be so excited that I became a Christian."
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:47.920]   So I sat down, and we had probably about an hour worth of conversation.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:52.060]   And I can't even remember exactly what he said, because I didn't know a whole lot about
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:55.100]   the Bible, other than the things that I learned in Sunday school.
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:28:00.180]   But he said something that triggered, it's like something's weird.
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.180]   And I asked him, "Are you a Jehovah Witness?"
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:08.020]   And I could tell that just kind of like, boom, like he didn't want to tell me that, but he
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.100]   admitted because I asked him, "Are you a Jehovah Witness?"
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.580]   And he said, "Yes."
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.660]   And obviously, boom, the walls went up, right?
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:15.660]   I have to be careful.
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:20.340]   Again, to this day, I have no idea what triggered that because I didn't know anything about
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.620]   Jehovah Witnesses.
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:26.460]   It must have been something that maybe my dad said that I kind of picked up subconsciously,
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.220]   and then boom, it went up.
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:34.060]   And then that encounter with him messed me up because this is the most strongest Christian
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.060]   I've ever met, at least in my mind.
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:41.560]   I mean, he takes his faith seriously than any other person that I've met.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:45.620]   How do I know that what I believe is true?
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.940]   How can I be so confident?
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:51.060]   Because he seemed to believe just as strong.
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.820]   So I went on this journey.
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.540]   Even as I was professing as a Christian, in the back of my mind, I needed to know for
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:58.540]   sure.
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.900]   What if I say I'm a Protestant because I was born in a Protestant home?
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:06.440]   My dad's a pastor, so that was the only access that I had.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.960]   So I began a journey to look for myself.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.980]   So every opportunity I got, I started to study different religions.
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:22.300]   Every extra elective class I had, I would study Buddhism and different Muslims and different
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.060]   things and would come back.
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:27.180]   And the conclusion was Christianity made the most sense.
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:31.980]   But the next question was then which Christianity, which version of Christianity made more sense?
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:32.980]   Mormonism?
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:37.820]   They say they have their Bible, and then Jehovah Witnesses, they say they have their Bible.
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:43.620]   Well, obviously, at the conclusion of that, and it wasn't a specific day that that happened,
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:49.540]   but after years of wrestling with this, my conclusion is not even close.
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:56.900]   The Word of God, to me, without a doubt, proved itself that this is God's Word.
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:01.660]   I could tell you all the extracurricular stuff, where archaeological finds fulfilled prophecies,
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:05.900]   the copies of manuscripts and how it was handled, scrutinized for thousands of years, and to
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.940]   this day, they couldn't destroy the credibility of the Word of God.
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.100]   The other Bibles were just, you trust a guy who is discredited.
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:18.740]   I mean, I can tell you about the stuff that I found, and it was almost impossible to believe
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.740]   their claim.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:24.740]   And even if you don't believe it, it's very difficult to dismiss.
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:33.740]   But since then, I can tell you with full conviction, the greatest revelation of God's Word is the
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:36.180]   Word itself.
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:39.900]   All this extra stuff, those are good to have.
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:40.900]   That's argument.
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:49.020]   But when you dive into the Word of God, you see the roots underneath the Word of God.
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:53.140]   On the surface, you read the words, and you see the connections, and you see how the themes
[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:57.660]   are connected, but the more you dive into the Word of God, you'll see the roots underneath
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:03.460]   that connects thousands of years of authors and themes, like just connected, one theme
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.900]   after another.
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.660]   And I couldn't understand, it's like everything points to Christ.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:14.660]   You know, as a young Christian, it's like, okay, I guess it is, but it is amazing.
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:20.900]   There is no way that a human being, no matter how wise, how smart, could have put this together
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:27.720]   in 1,500 years, 45 different men to have brought this together.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:34.180]   And the more you see the roots underneath, you sense the breath of God in His Word.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:41.380]   I don't know how many times I'm doing quiet time, and just instinctively, I hear myself
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:44.820]   say, "Wow.
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.180]   Wow."
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:51.780]   Because I get to see a glimpse of God through the Word.
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:55.240]   And many times, it's through the same thing I'm looking at.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:01.140]   I've preached through almost every part of the Bible, did quiet time numerous times,
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.140]   every part of the Bible.
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.940]   But even now, as I'm going through it, it's like, "Wow."
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:11.740]   Because I still, it's living and active.
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:18.460]   The words that it says now, as a 54-year-old, in the stage of life, my perspective is completely
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:23.860]   different, and it looks very different than when I was 16 or 20 or 30 or 40.
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.260]   And every time, it's just living and active.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:29.460]   It's not, it's never dead.
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:34.420]   It's hard for me to explain to you, other than to invite you yourself to come, take
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.300]   a look.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:43.260]   The power of the Word of God is not your knowledge, is not to be able to connect the dots to have
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:48.020]   the best and the most perfect systematic theology.
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:53.180]   And I'm not saying that doesn't matter, but that has no power to change anybody, other
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.340]   than to make you look good.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.260]   And nobody cares.
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:02.220]   You know how when somebody, when you see pride in people, the natural instinct is to humble
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:03.220]   them?
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.220]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.220]   Right?
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:07.820]   And somebody comes on the basketball court and they start speaking trash, and everybody
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.140]   motivated is to humble that person?
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:14.460]   That's what happens when you get filled with knowledge.
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:17.420]   You don't inspire people.
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.100]   You inspire people to humble you.
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.300]   That's what happens, right?
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:27.580]   The power of the Word of God is that question.
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:29.700]   Do you believe it?
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.540]   Do you believe this is the Word of God?
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:38.860]   You know what's amazing about this is, after this encounter, he says, "Because of your
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:42.620]   unbelief, he gets punished."
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:49.060]   And in his punishment, in this discipline, basically he doesn't get to speak during
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:53.740]   Elizabeth's pregnancy.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.700]   Whenever God disciplines, there's always two sides.
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:00.580]   Just like if you were to discipline your children, you're disciplining them, but you're not
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.820]   disciplining them just to hurt them.
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:04.820]   I hope not.
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.420]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.620]   Most parents will know that you're disciplining them, but you're hoping that the discipline
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.380]   would lead to something positive, and that's why discipline happens.
[00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:18.460]   And in the same way, God brings discipline, and there's a negative side to this discipline.
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.260]   He could not speak.
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:29.780]   But the privilege that he had to represent Israel and go and then pray, that at the end
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:33.420]   of that, he would declare the priestly blessing upon Israel.
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.500]   That was his privilege.
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:40.300]   So typically what would happen, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime privilege, that he would
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:44.500]   come out and declare number 624 through 26.
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.220]   He said, "The Lord bless you and keep you.
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:50.000]   The Lord make His face shine on you and be gracious to you.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.980]   The Lord lift up His counseling on you and give you peace."
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.980]   That was his blessing.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:03.140]   That's like winning the lottery, to stand before God's people and God, and to come out
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:07.900]   of that room saying, "The Lord bless you and keep you."
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:12.580]   Because of his unbelief, he couldn't do it.
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:16.820]   Not only that, the whole reason why John was coming to be a forerunner, to tell people
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.220]   about the coming Messiah.
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.820]   And so that privilege was taken away from him, so he could not.
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.760]   So he had to keep quiet.
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.940]   And I'm sure that kind of grieved his heart, that one time he was looking forward to, when
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:32.500]   he won the lottery, to go in there and he was looking forward to, like after he's done,
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:36.400]   "I'm going to come there, represent God, the Lord bless you, and keep you, make His face
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.980]   shine upon you."
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:43.660]   And he comes out and he's like, because he couldn't speak, so he's making sign language.
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:46.680]   What is he saying?
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:52.460]   But just like everything negative, there's always a positive to his discipline.
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.760]   Remember Israel?
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:59.880]   They go to Canaan, they come back and they said, "They're too big for us.
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.160]   They're going to kill us if we go."
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:06.320]   And as a result of that, Israel wanders in the desert for 40 years.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.260]   So the punishment was they couldn't go into the Promised Land.
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:16.340]   But the 40 years in the desert was the best time Israel had in their history.
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:22.940]   Forty years, where God spoke to them, God moved, His fire would move.
[00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:26.260]   God was in the tabernacle, was in the middle, people were worshiping God.
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:28.140]   When He told them to move, they would move.
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.780]   They told them to sit down, they would sit down.
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:34.720]   And as long as the Lord was with them, they were protected for 40 years.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:39.780]   So even though they were being punished, the 40 years was the best time in Israel's life.
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:45.060]   Like Moses, 40 years is wandering in the desert and he's about to go in and he strikes the
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:50.220]   rock and God says, "Because you do not show me as holy, you cannot go in."
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.980]   And Moses wanted to go in so bad, "Look at that beautiful land."
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:57.020]   And God says, "Enough, you will not go in."
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:04.340]   If you look at Israel's history, as soon as they enter Canaan, everything fell apart.
[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:09.060]   They started following the idols and you think Israel was frustrated during the 40 years
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:12.300]   of wandering.
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:18.220]   So even though he was being disciplined, he was actually being spared as well.
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:24.540]   The positive of being mute, one, it was a sign that God was actually going to do what
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:28.140]   He said He was going to do.
[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:36.580]   But the greatest time of knowing God, hearing God is when God isolates us and oftentimes
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:41.820]   in pain and in struggle.
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:46.340]   You ever hear in the middle of the night the clock ticking?
[00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.340]   You ever hear that?
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:51.980]   Or you wake up in the middle of the night and you hear the water dripping from the faucet?
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:53.180]   During the day, you wouldn't hear it.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.540]   You try to hear it, you can't hear it, right?
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:38:01.060]   But in the middle of the night when it's dead silence, something that you don't even know
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:03.500]   exists will keep you up at night.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:07.100]   Well, at least me.
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:13.300]   You hear the ticking.
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.980]   That's what it sounds like in the middle of the night.
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:20.820]   But why can't you hear it during the day?
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:25.620]   It's not all of a sudden that thing gets like the volume, they turn off the volume three
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.940]   o'clock in the morning.
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:31.900]   It's because all the other noise disappeared.
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:35.580]   All the other noise has disappeared.
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:40.420]   And so all of a sudden that noise is amplified.
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:45.980]   And I remember thinking in the middle of the night, how much of God's voice is being drowned
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:54.620]   out by the noise of our life, the busyness, trying to present ourselves a certain way,
[00:38:54.620 --> 00:39:02.060]   being concerned about our paycheck, about relationships, about how people view us.
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:09.260]   How much of God's voice is drowned out because of that?
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:15.500]   Sometimes God will isolate us in order for him to speak to us.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:24.140]   I remember back when I was 19 and 20, I had a job, I shared with you, where I was a janitor
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:25.620]   at Hughes Aircraft at Fullerton.
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:29.580]   It doesn't exist there anymore, but it was a large piece of land where if you were in
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:32.520]   the middle of the company, you couldn't hear anything outside.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:36.380]   And so my job was from five to two in the morning to clean up trash cans and vacuum
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:40.220]   and tidy things up in about 10, 15 bungalows.
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:46.860]   And I remember the sun would go down around 5.30, 6 o'clock during the wintertime.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:51.240]   And I remember being so isolated during that time because one, I was trying to break away
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.500]   from my worldly friends.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.460]   I didn't want to do what they were doing.
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.540]   I was trying to get back right with God.
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:00.900]   And so I separated from them.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.580]   I wasn't living at home.
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:04.940]   I was outside by myself.
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:08.940]   So I was working from five to two and then I would go to sleep around 2.30, get home,
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:12.700]   and then I'd have to wake up around seven because I have to go to school.
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:19.780]   And then I tried, I tried to take full time and I would go to school till about two in
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:23.100]   the afternoon and I'd have to take a short nap and then go back to work.
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.500]   And this was my schedule from Monday through Friday.
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:30.740]   And then because I didn't have any time during the day, because I was working and going to
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:38.220]   school, every Friday, Saturday, Sunday night, I would hang out at Biola by myself, just
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.200]   trying to study.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.220]   So part of it was because I was trying to study.
[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:47.180]   And part of it was because I had nowhere else to go, to be honest with you, because I wasn't
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:48.380]   involved in any ministry.
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.620]   I didn't have any friends to call.
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:56.620]   And so, you know, Friday night I was at Biola, you know, at some, because back then they
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:58.060]   used to leave all the rooms open.
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:01.900]   I don't know how many guys are Biola students and now they don't because they don't trust
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:02.900]   you.
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:03.900]   They trusted us back then.
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.540]   So they had everything open.
[00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:09.140]   So I would go there Friday night, Saturday night, Sunday night, you know, whenever I
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.380]   was done, I would go there and hang out.
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:13.500]   And I remember just being so lonely.
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:17.700]   You know, no, no, no friends.
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:22.100]   And I remember my birthday would come and go and having no contact with anybody that
[00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:23.540]   I knew.
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:32.580]   But man, that period, Jesus was so real to me.
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:35.760]   It was so real.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:45.960]   And as painful as that period was, I often think about, I wish I was back there.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.240]   I didn't put myself there.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.780]   I didn't choose to be there.
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:53.860]   My circumstance, and because I got into so much trouble, I was trying to break away from
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.300]   my friends.
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:42:00.020]   And I forced myself into that position because I needed to, I needed to pay the bills and
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.500]   I needed to go to school.
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:13.220]   And I remember everything God said was so loud and clear to me, everything that I read.
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:19.540]   And I remember going to the chapel at Biola, not because I had an agenda, like, oh, I got
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:25.220]   to pray for this and I need to pray for my family and to pray with, because just being
[00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:31.680]   in his presence was, was where I wanted to be more than anywhere else.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:37.340]   So sometimes I would just go to the chapel and just sit there and say, God, I'm here.
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.580]   And I'd rather be here with you than anywhere else.
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:42.860]   And to be honest, I had nowhere else to go.
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:49.020]   And I remember thinking to myself, if I can maintain this relationship with Jesus, I don't
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.020]   need to get married.
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:53.380]   Don't get me wrong, I wanted to get married.
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:54.380]   Right.
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:57.100]   But I remember thinking, I don't need to get married.
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:00.260]   That's how real he was to me.
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:04.380]   And all of that because he isolated me.
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:07.860]   And I had nothing else.
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:13.100]   Sometimes God will, it may seem like discipline and it is sometimes because God's trying to
[00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.820]   correct us.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:22.300]   But in his correction, there's always love.
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.420]   There's always grace.
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:32.580]   And you will always meet a gentle and caring Jesus.
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.580]   Always.
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:40.980]   Sometimes our faith feels smaller than a mustard seed.
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.640]   And we struggle.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:48.300]   And our honest prayer is, Lord, I believe, help my unbelief.
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:53.620]   I believe, help my unbelief.
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:44:00.180]   Jesus waited for the perfect time because the perfect time was when Israel's faith was
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:04.740]   like a burning wick that should have been snuffed out.
[00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:10.280]   It was a burning wick that should have been snuffed out.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:15.260]   It was a bruised reed that would have been useful for nothing.
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:19.180]   And just hanging on by a thread.
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:24.020]   And yet Jesus promised a battered reed he will not break off and a smoldering wick he
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:30.340]   will not put out until he leads justice to victory.
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:34.440]   I pray that you would come to know this Jesus.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.620]   Not a figurehead Jesus.
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:41.500]   Not just a theological Jesus.
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:45.620]   Not just a Jesus to be worshipped from a distance or something to be looked forward to when
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:48.380]   we go to heaven.
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:57.860]   But this Jesus, this sympathetic high priest, that even as we struggle, even as we recognize
[00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:03.300]   more and more each day that we are undeserving, that you would come to know this sympathetic
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.420]   high priest.
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:15.380]   So when they ask you, do you believe, that you would resoundingly say, yes, I believe.
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.300]   I believe, Lord.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:21.100]   All my unbelief, I believe.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:27.820]   I pray that as we continue to wrestle through his word, that this is the Jesus that you
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:38.420]   come to know, to grow, to love, to follow, and to proclaim.
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:44.460]   Let's pray.
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:54.660]   Lord, you truly are beautiful beyond comprehension.
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:46:02.060]   I pray, Father God, that you would open our eyes, that we may enter the throne of grace
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:14.380]   with confidence, that we may find help, grace, mercy, and love when we are weak, when we
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:24.260]   are discouraged, when we have failed, when we are isolated, when we are alone.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:31.860]   Lord God, help us, Lord, as you've drawn near to us, that you would draw your children to
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:34.180]   yourself.
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.780]   We love you.
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:37.020]   We honor you.
[00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:38.220]   We want to follow you.
[00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:39.780]   We want to glorify you.
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.180]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
