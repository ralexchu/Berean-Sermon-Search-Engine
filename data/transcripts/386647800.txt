[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560]   Let's take a look at our passage.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.080]   I'm going to read for us Ephesians, and we're going to start from verse 1 and go down to
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.400]   verse 14, and then we'll pray and jump into the study.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.120]   So let's take a look at the passage, and it says, "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.040]   the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus and who are faithful in Christ Jesus,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.160]   praise to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.800]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with every
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.920]   spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, just as he chose us in him before
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.460]   the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before him.
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.440]   In love he predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to himself, according
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.260]   to the kind intention of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.520]   freely bestowed on us in the beloved.
[00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.880]   In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.440]   to the riches of his grace, which he lavished on us.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.320]   In all wisdom and insight he made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.280]   kind intention, which he purposed in him.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.320]   With a view to an administration suitable to the fullness of the times, that is a summing
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.160]   up of all things in Christ, things in the heavens and things on the earth.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.760]   In him also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to his purpose,
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.480]   who works all things after the counsel of his will, to the end that we who were the
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.300]   first to hope in Christ would be to the praise of his glory.
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.340]   In him you also, after listening to the message of the truth, the gospel of your salvation,
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.500]   having also believed, you were sealed in him with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is given
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.980]   as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God's own possession,
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.100]   to the praise of his glory.
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.980]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.620]   Lord, we thank you for your incredible grace.
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.820]   And Father, as we study this passage, we recognize that your grace is abounding.
[00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.620]   Lord, the way that you have expressed your love, it's incredible.
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.300]   Father, in the many multifaceted ways in which you have blessed us, God, we can only begin
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.500]   to appreciate and understand.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.140]   We pray, God, that you grant to us just hearts of faith, hearts of gratitude.
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.500]   Lord, as we look upon all that you have done for us in Christ, we thank you it's in Christ
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.460]   and we pray, amen.
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.460]   Okay, I'd like to begin with some just introductory remarks.
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.180]   As we read that, I mean, that is a pretty incredible section of scripture.
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.180]   As a matter of fact, there are lots of people who will note that this portion of scripture
[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.060]   in Ephesians is their favorite passage of all time.
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.340]   Because in such an incredible way, just in these short verses, 11 verses or so, it summarizes
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.260]   like what God has been doing in redemption, right?
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.420]   It summarizes all the blessings we have.
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.500]   It summarizes the heavenly things that we can look forward to.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.420]   I mean, it just gives to us so much.
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.660]   And that's the kind of introductory remark I would like to say is that verse three through
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.460]   14 is like a rhapsody.
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.860]   And what a rhapsody is, is when you think of somebody who is just giving this eloquent,
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.940]   lyrical, almost like genius kind of expression of intense emotion, intense thought, that's
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.820]   a rhapsody, okay?
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.180]   And that's exactly what Apostle Paul is doing.
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.940]   He is enthusiastically expressing how we ought to bless God because God has blessed
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.300]   us in such incredible fashion, right?
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.300]   And the incredible thing about all this is that although in the English language, as
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.820]   it's translated, it's broken up into about three sentences, this long, long paragraph
[00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.460]   starting from verse three all the way to verse 14 is actually one incredible run-on sentence
[00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.020]   in the Greek.
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.580]   There is this like overflowing excitement in Apostle Paul.
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.820]   And a lot of people actually look at this and they'll say, "This is one of the most
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:16.260]   lyrically and literally like genius pieces because it almost feels like it can be sung."
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.660]   And a lot of people say there's this rhythm and there is this movement to this section.
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.860]   And the reason why I'm highlighting this to you is because then what you see in Apostle
[00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.580]   Paul is somebody who is just so enamored with the truth of Christ.
[00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.900]   And if you've ever seen somebody who really gets it, right?
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.300]   If you've ever interacted with somebody who really truly understands, what you'll see
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.860]   is that that person has looked at this precious truth, this precious faith that we have in
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.540]   multiple angles so that he can summarize incredible truths into short, condensed ways.
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.420]   And when you see that, you realize like this person understands.
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.660]   But what's more, he can extrapolate and say, "Let me give you examples."
[00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.900]   Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.020]   And so what we say, you know, in a kind of idiomatic way is, "He knows it in and out."
[00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.620]   That's what you feel when Apostle Paul is walking through with us.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.460]   Look at the way God has blessed us.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.460]   Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, right?
[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.660]   And then he can summarize it all in such great ways.
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.860]   And so as we say this, I ask you this question, "Do you feel Apostle Paul exhorting us to
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.860]   something?
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.720]   Is there a command in here?"
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.260]   And what's really interesting, the answer is yes and no.
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.340]   The no is because there is no command.
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.620]   There is actually no verb in verse 3, which is kind of weird, okay?
[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.740]   And what's more, what Apostle Paul is doing is he is just, in a weird way to say, is going
[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.740]   off, right?
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.080]   He's going off about how amazing God is.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:51.420]   But there is a thrust there because when you look at verse 3, he says, "Blessed be God."
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.980]   Now that's not a command.
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.440]   It's not an imperative.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.260]   What it is is an adjective.
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.900]   But he puts it right at the beginning of that long, long paragraph in an emphatic way to
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.740]   tell us this is what we need to do.
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.420]   Praise be to God because of the incredible multifaceted way by which he has blessed us,
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.420]   okay?
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.420]   All right.
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:19.940]   So then as we look at that, what we're gonna do now is walk through the passage together.
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.520]   And just to kind of remind us, remember that our number one step in good Bible study is
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.660]   to make sure we're making keen observations about the passage.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.660]   Please know, especially in a passage like this where it's just rich, right?
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.140]   He's summarizing massive truths.
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.780]   There's tons of truths coming at us in rapid fashion.
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.960]   You're gonna probably have to read that passage a couple times, right?
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.020]   And what I like to typically advise is when there is this kind of paragraph and there's
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:54.500]   long stretches of thought, it is good for you to observe the flow of thought, okay?
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.820]   Because as you read, you wanna just track with him because there is very organized flow
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.380]   of thought in Apostle Paul.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.820]   And what's more, break it down phrase by phrase.
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.180]   And you guys know that I like to do this in the Bible studies whenever I get an opportunity
[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:14.860]   is, if there's a long, long sentence, trying to read it in a paragraph form is tough.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:20.220]   Visually, it really helps to break it down phrase by phrase and then ask the question,
[00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.620]   what is the relationship between those phrases?
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.780]   And then when you look at this long list, actually create a list.
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:33.340]   I hope that when you did your Bible study and you recognize like, "Oh, he's just listing
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.100]   off every single way that we're blessed in Christ."
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.900]   I hope you actually then created a list, one, two, three, four, five, six, and start to
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.480]   appreciate, look at the many ways I can number them, right?
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:50.600]   I can number them so that you too, just like Apostle Paul, know in and out detail but also
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.180]   grand summary, okay?
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:58.000]   So that's just an encouragement on observation, especially in a passage like this.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.120]   And then let's begin with verse three.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.120]   Here it is.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.220]   It says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.540]   with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ."
[00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.540]   Okay?
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:17.820]   I may mention for you that that little portion right there is not a verb, but it's an adjective,
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.820]   okay?
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.300]   It is an emphatic adjective where he's saying, "God is blessed."
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:28.780]   But as he's doing that, I believe there is then kind of an exhortational expectation
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.660]   as Apostle Paul is praising, "You need to too."
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.900]   Now when, again, when you take a look at this passage like this, sometimes it's hard to
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.580]   appreciate all the elements.
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.440]   So what I like to do is break it down.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.140]   And this is what I've done for you on your handout, right?
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:48.140]   I did that so that we can run through it pretty quickly where we make observations on the
[00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.500]   five verses that we have today.
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.500]   Okay?
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:09:01.260]   So when we take a look at this, in my mind as I see that first segment, that first phrase,
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:06.060]   again, I would like to label that as a command and say, "Apostle Paul is challenging us.
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.540]   Blessed be God."
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:13.940]   And the thing about it is he gives us to us then several phrases describing that concept.
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.700]   And the way that I like to do is I like to make these arrows and show you that when he
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:23.380]   says, "Blessed be God," he has this positive phrase where he says, "Who has blessed us?"
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.540]   How has he blessed us?
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.540]   With every spiritual blessing.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:31.060]   These spiritual blessings are in the heavenly places in Christ.
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.140]   You see how I broke it up into little phrases?
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.140]   Da-da-da-da-da-da?
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:39.980]   And the thing is, these little terms, which are, whether it be a positive just pronoun,
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:44.460]   whether it be a preposition, I know we're getting into English grammar now, okay?
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:50.820]   Preposition, they all help to signify for you the relationship between these phrases,
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.900]   okay?
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:56.980]   In order to do good observation, again, I like to label so that I can see, okay, this
[00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:01.540]   is what he's saying, and then quickly, easily see patterns.
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.020]   So how am I labeling?
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.820]   First, there is this kind of command adjective at the beginning.
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.940]   There is this positive definition.
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.860]   This is the God who has blessed you.
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.820]   And then, oh, sorry.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:20.300]   And then there are the second and prepositional phrases where it says, "With every spiritual
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.100]   blessing in the heavenly places in Christ," okay?
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:28.920]   And as we do good Bible study, when you break it down like that, that's how you start asking
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.460]   really good questions or just questions that are more specific and detailed.
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.580]   What do I mean?
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.140]   You could ask the question, "If he's blessed us, how has he blessed us?"
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.780]   That sets you up for the rest of the paragraph.
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.340]   If it's every spiritual blessing, what does this even refer to?
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:48.820]   The question should be, "What is this every spiritual blessing?"
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.940]   What is his concept of every spiritual blessing?
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.500]   Why is it in the heavenlies?
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.300]   That's what I'm talking about, okay?
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.300]   All right.
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.620]   So here we have a breakdown in verse three.
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.060]   Here we have a great topic sentence for the paragraph.
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.500]   Remember how I was saying that you want to just follow Apostle Paul's flow of thought?
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:12.340]   It's incredible as Apostle Paul has a way, he's very organized, of giving us this amazing
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.940]   succinct like topic sentence.
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.180]   You know, when you guys write essays, you guys have to write that.
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.620]   And he does that for us here.
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.900]   God is to be blessed because he's blessed us with everything.
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:24.900]   Let me show you how.
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.100]   Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, right?
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.940]   That's how this paragraph runs.
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:29.940]   Okay.
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.180]   And so, not to make much of this, but the transition is there for us.
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:39.580]   He says, "Just as," and I gave you some other translations too, "Just to show us," Apostle
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:44.140]   Paul is extrapolating the every spiritual blessings in the heavenlies that he's thinking
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.140]   about.
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.220]   He is showing us what they are line item at a time.
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.260]   And again, he says, "The first one, as he's thinking about the spiritual blessings that
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:58.300]   we receive, is he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we would be holy
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.220]   and blameless before him."
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.220]   Okay?
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:06.860]   Now, I'm going to again break that up for us into small, succinct phrases.
[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.180]   It's a little bit different than what I have in the packet.
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.500]   Your packet was just kind of like a cursory run.
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.300]   So then I broke down little smaller sections.
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.180]   For example, even the thing as, "In him."
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.180]   Okay?
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:23.660]   We could even break this down and separate, "Just as," separate it, "He chose us."
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:28.420]   The idea of him choosing us is an incredible blessing.
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.100]   Have you guys ever thought about it that way?
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:37.340]   Predestination, election is not a theological topic just to be debated.
[00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:43.100]   Here he's presenting to you in his mind of the list of ways that God has blessed you,
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.820]   it comes first.
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.820]   Pretty incredible, right?
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:52.780]   And he says, "He chose you," chose us, "in him before the foundation of the world that
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.580]   we would be holy and blameless before him."
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:01.540]   Here now I broke down those phrases, but as good students of the scriptures, as trying
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:07.380]   to make strong observations, we have to now identify and tag the phrases.
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:08.420]   Okay?
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.700]   And the way I'm going to do it for you is like this.
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.780]   First, clearly this is the first blessing.
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.700]   So I'll just tag it as this is number one on the list of things, the blessing that he
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.060]   has for us.
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.980]   But what's more, he describes in detail when.
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.660]   Okay?
[00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.620]   I'm saving the "in him" part of it for an emphatic point later.
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.740]   By saying, "before the foundation of the world," think about that.
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:38.380]   Before the expanse, before the waters and the waters, and before the land coming up,
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:42.740]   before the light, the foundation, before the foundation of the world, that is when God
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.220]   has enacted his masterful plan.
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:50.740]   What's more, the why, that we would be holy and blameless before him.
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.940]   This is an incredible, incredible blessing for us.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.240]   And I'm going to make much of this a little bit later on when we start drawing some conclusions,
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.100]   but I want you to just take a moment to think about that.
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:07.460]   This blessing that God has for us is not a blessing by which he simply permits you to
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.500]   go to heaven as you are.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.900]   No.
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:15.940]   God in his redemption, he's transforming you.
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:22.420]   He is radically changing every single one of us, taking us from stained, unholy, rebellious
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:31.380]   sinners and making us so pure that we are blameless before the holy eyes of God.
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.380]   That's crazy.
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.380]   Right?
[00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:34.380]   That's incredible.
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.080]   We can't miss the point.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.900]   This is an incredible, heavenly blessing in Christ.
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:47.780]   When he's thinking blessings, he's thinking, "Think about the way he chose you."
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:48.780]   Okay.
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.180]   Moving forward to verse four.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:57.860]   He says, "In love, he predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to himself, according
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:02.400]   to the kind intention of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.860]   freely bestowed on us in the beloved."
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:09.580]   See, again, if we just run through a passage like this in paragraph form, it's very difficult
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.180]   to appreciate all the little elements.
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:15.740]   So you break it down a little bit, and we again want to label.
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:20.020]   Notice how the concept of choosing and predestining is repeated there.
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.020]   Okay?
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.020]   It's repeated there.
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:28.000]   But this time, he adds the idea that the predestining was to adoption.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.580]   And so I want you to think about that for a moment.
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:31.580]   Right?
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:38.140]   Some people will say the doctrine of election is cold, mechanical, and fatalistic, but not
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.140]   here.
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.140]   There is incredible intentionality.
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:46.660]   There is incredible purpose to the election that God exercises.
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:54.700]   And it is an election to adoption, an incredibly intimate and unique relationship between father
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.060]   and child.
[00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.220]   Right?
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:02.060]   And what's more, we see the similar phrases that you probably saw as repetitions.
[00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:07.140]   There is through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the kind intention of his will.
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.340]   Now I want you to do something for a moment.
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.940]   There is clearly a pattern that's going to start building.
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.260]   He's going to list multiple blessings.
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.460]   He's going to talk about the means that by which that blessing came, which is through
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.460]   Jesus Christ.
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:24.140]   And then he's going to talk about the purpose, to his praise, to his glory, to himself.
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.420]   And you see that pattern repeated now.
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.260]   But I ask you this question.
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.580]   How would you identify, how will you classify this phrase?
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.540]   According to the kind intention of his will.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.900]   Take a moment to think about that.
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.540]   It's like, hmm.
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.140]   We could clearly tag the blessings.
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.140]   Those are easy.
[00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.140]   You have adoption.
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.140]   You have been chosen.
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.140]   You have redemption.
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.900]   You have forgiveness.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:52.020]   What about when he starts to reveal like this is all in accordance to the kind intention
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.020]   of my will?
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:57.340]   That's a kind of tough one, huh?
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.780]   What would you label that?
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.540]   I want you to take a moment to just do it, like on your sheet.
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.780]   You know, like what is this?
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:11.660]   Because these are the moments that you start to classify and you say, oh man, God is revealing
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.380]   his heart.
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.420]   This is his motivation, right?
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.860]   This is his intention.
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.940]   This is the source of why he's doing this.
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.660]   And all of a sudden you start to appreciate that phrase even in greater fashion when you
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.540]   start to try to identify what is this, okay?
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.220]   So perhaps you might want to put in there, this is God's motivation.
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.860]   This is his heart, okay?
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:41.540]   Verse six, he talks about to the praise of the glory of his grace, which is purpose,
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:46.300]   which he freely bestowed on us, that I label as a blessing, okay?
[00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.340]   I'm not sure if you were making your list, you saw adoption, clearly blessing.
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.160]   You saw being chosen, clearly blessing.
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:58.860]   But this idea of his grace, there should be this weird thing where he says his grace is
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:04.060]   to be praised by how just the reality of how marvelous it is.
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:08.660]   But then he says that grace he freely bestowed on you.
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.420]   Then that is to you, your blessing, okay?
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.820]   Did you guys get all this here?
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:18.380]   We see purpose, we see another blessing, and we see the means.
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.820]   It's in the beloved.
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:27.840]   Next, verse seven, he says, in him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:34.340]   of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished on us, okay?
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.840]   So we have two blessings here.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.840]   One is you have redemption.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.200]   Second is you have forgiveness of our trespasses.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.140]   If you're studying and you label it like this, this would be like blessing number four, blessing
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.140]   number five, right?
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:51.860]   And then you should ask the question, hmm, the sentence runs on, is he trying to see
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.340]   this as like a synonymous thing?
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:55.860]   What's the difference between redemption?
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.400]   What's the difference between that and forgiveness?
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.600]   Is there conceptually some nuances that I should appreciate?
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.820]   Those are some questions you should be asking, right?
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:09.140]   And then he has that phrase again, according to the riches of his grace, which is so similar
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:13.020]   to according to the kind intention of his will.
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.480]   So I put there, this is God's motive, right?
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.480]   This is God's motive.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.020]   All right.
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:24.840]   So we ran through verses three through eight, and I hope that was an encouragement to you,
[00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.020]   right?
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:33.620]   If you're able to take those paragraphs and those phrases, and then you divide it by the
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:39.120]   phrases that you see, what you'll realize is you're getting his thought and flow.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:46.780]   And once you ask and you highlight these terms through, oh no, through, according, which
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.380]   now you see relationships between his thoughts.
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.140]   You see that, right?
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.260]   Through shows you means.
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.500]   This is through his blood.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.060]   Lavishing means this is according to his heart.
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:02.780]   This is his motive, or you can even say this is then his agenda, his pattern, his heart.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.020]   And then which he lavished, this is manner, right?
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.020]   Because this is lavishing.
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.620]   All right.
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.060]   So as we walk through that, I hope that was an encouragement to you.
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:14.140]   I want to give you this general outline.
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:17.300]   Within this general outline, I ask you this question, like in verse three through 14,
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.180]   what's the main point here?
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:25.860]   And what we see in this general outline is Apostle Paul summarizing why God is to be
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:26.860]   blessed.
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:34.420]   And as he's doing that, he is basically in a rapid fire fashion giving us all the different
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.340]   ways that God has blessed us.
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.180]   Since we're dealing with verses three through eight, we see a couple main blessings that
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.580]   God has given.
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:45.780]   Namely, he chose us for holiness and adoption.
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:50.220]   Secondly, he has graced us with redemption and forgiveness.
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.220]   Okay?
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:56.060]   Now, what's pretty incredible is this is not the only outline that you can use.
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:01.500]   What's really incredible is for the next study, I'm going to ask you, how is the Trinity involved
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.420]   in this redemptive process?
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.980]   How is the Trinity involved in all of salvation?
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:10.620]   And what you'll notice is Apostle Paul not only categorized it in the choosing in the
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:15.660]   redemption, a lot of commentators noticed, wow, so there's past blessings, present
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.500]   blessings, future blessings.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.140]   Later you will realize there is seal for the future, right?
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.720]   Seal for the inheritance.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:26.180]   But then there's also an organization between the Trinity as God is decreeing and he is
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:32.660]   working what the Lord Jesus Christ is accomplishing and what the Holy Spirit is accomplishing.
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.580]   So what you'll find in the organization of this passage is Apostle Paul kind of beautifully
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:44.460]   applying multiple categories to help us conceptually understand, look how blessed you are.
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.060]   Look how much God is to be praised.
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.000]   Okay.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:56.860]   So drawing some conclusions, we want to move to really appreciating some of these elements.
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:03.060]   I just mentioned by segue, the first conclusion or I guess like exhortation, first takeaway
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:10.840]   that we should really see from this passage is that we should recognize truly how spiritually
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.420]   blessed we are, right?
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:20.900]   I mean we're getting a laundry list of blessings, but emphatically so we're seeing some like
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:25.780]   monumental, monumental blessings that we have in Christ.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:31.660]   And the very first thing that we see is being chosen, but I wanted to show you and highlight
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:35.620]   that in terms of repeated concept, this is the greatest.
[00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.620]   Okay.
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:40.760]   So here I'm going to read the passage for us again, just highlighting the things that
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.600]   Apostle Paul highlighted for us as blessings to us.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:50.200]   Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with every
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.920]   spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:59.680]   Just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:00.940]   before him.
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:05.360]   In love he predestined us to adoptions as sons through Jesus Christ to himself, according
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.400]   to the kind intention of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.160]   freely bestowed on us in the beloved.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.760]   In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.480]   to the riches of the grace, which he lavished on us.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:25.600]   One of the brothers in our table group, he said, man, when you look at this, you feel
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.160]   almost smothered.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.480]   That's how you should feel.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:37.600]   You should feel a sense of this incredible, overflowing grace upon you.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:42.760]   And we can appreciate that just by thinking about the one concept of being chosen.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.560]   I want to ask you this question.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:49.240]   As we looked at this passage, this is one of the clearer passages, one of the main passages
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.260]   people go to when they talk about the doctrine of election.
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.240]   It is a hot topic for a lot of people.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.920]   They're like, no, it just doesn't sound fair.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.920]   It doesn't sound right.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.680]   It just sounds like God's going, you and you and you.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.560]   It's just completely arbitrary.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.560]   But that's not true.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.800]   That's not the way the scripture describes it.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:13.960]   When we take a moment to appreciate the doctrine of election, and we actually ask those questions
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:22.400]   of when, why, how, who is doing the electing, which persons is he electing?
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:28.240]   All of a sudden, that whole doctrine becomes an incredible, incredible blessing of his
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.240]   love.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.440]   Just take a moment to think together.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:37.600]   When we think about God's choosing, and we think about when, have you ever thought about
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:44.920]   the fact that then that means, yes, God is eternal and he is beyond time.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:51.480]   But we can't just bypass the fact that then his kind heart intention has been expressing
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:56.240]   itself for thousands of years.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.920]   I want you to take a moment just to think about time.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:04.160]   Who in your life has loved you the longest?
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.560]   That's the person you should be most grateful for.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.480]   I mean, I want you to think about this.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.200]   There are people in your life who have become close friends really fast, and you're so thankful
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.020]   for them because you connect.
[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:21.900]   But there is a different kind of gratitude you give to somebody who has been for a long,
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:27.660]   long period of time being faithful and loyal to you, laboring with their kind intention
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:33.260]   to do you good across time.
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:37.260]   I gave this example a long time ago in one of the sermons I gave.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.780]   I could buy you a meal tomorrow and say, "Let me take you out."
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:40.780]   Why?
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.260]   Because I care for you.
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.300]   I want to feed you.
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.540]   You would say, "Thank you, Pastor Mark.
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.600]   That's so nice of you."
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:53.860]   But you owe a different kind of gratitude to your parents who have fed you for like
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:26:02.740]   18, 20, some of you much longer than that, fed you every meal, planned for your nutrition.
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.860]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.900]   Me taking you out for lunch, is it nice?
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:08.960]   Yes.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:15.060]   But somebody who has been intentionally taking care of you for the course of your life, you
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.540]   owe a different kind of gratitude.
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.300]   Yes?
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:26.140]   But when you think about this, he reveals to you and opens up a mystery that God has
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:34.420]   had his perfect plan for you prior to the foundation of the world.
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.820]   Just imagine that.
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.180]   It's incredible.
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:47.100]   What's more, his choosing was a kind of choosing for the purpose of making you holy and blameless.
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.460]   That means setting you apart.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.420]   That means making you blameless.
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:56.180]   That means making you so pure and holy that you can stand before the holy eyes of the
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:02.900]   holy judge and stand completely unashamed.
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:08.820]   What is going to cause those who are in Christ to be so pure, you stand before God without
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:13.980]   an inch of nervousness like, "Oh my gosh, is he going to?"
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.840]   Can you imagine that?
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.880]   And I want you to appreciate this even from a greater degree because the kind of love
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:24.660]   that we have for people, when we love somebody, we want their good.
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:30.400]   But I want you to think about it in just that whole concept of who it is he's loving and
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.780]   who he is.
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.140]   Here's the example.
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:40.780]   Ladies, if you see a guy who's just filthy, his hygiene is like negative 10.
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.580]   He's wearing the same old dingy sweater.
[00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:45.060]   It smells like BO.
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:47.900]   And clearly he's been to the gym with it and he hasn't changed.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:48.900]   He doesn't shave.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.260]   He doesn't comb his hair.
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.900]   And there's grease coming out, dripping from his locks.
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.580]   Is your thought to be like, "Oh dear, I need to wash you.
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.740]   I need to bathe you."
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.700]   Would you even offer that?
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:04.700]   No.
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:05.700]   You would be annoyed.
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.860]   You would say, "Get away."
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.820]   You'd just be appalled like, "Do you not see yourself?"
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.140]   I want you to think about this.
[00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:21.620]   The kind of mercy and kind intention God must have to see the utter filth of mankind where
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:25.820]   every intention of man was wicked.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:31.900]   And then to desire to wash us, to make us holy and blameless.
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:40.500]   Have you ever conceded that God's push for you to be holy is one incredible blessing?
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:45.980]   If we've ever been burdened by the scripture's expectation for us to be holy and sanctified,
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:49.020]   have you ever considered that that is not a burden to us?
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:52.900]   It is one incredible act of love.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:58.540]   He rephrased it, "It's an ongoing incredible act of love."
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.660]   That is to us our blessing.
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:09.220]   And then to say, "I have predestined you for adoption."
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:18.820]   If we took a moment to think, the kind of choosing that God chose us, it's God Almighty.
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.300]   He's not one celebrity.
[00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.460]   He's not one incredible authoritative figure.
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:30.140]   He is God Almighty of the universe choosing wretched children of the devil.
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:36.100]   And if proponents who are minions or whoever it may be who deny the election of God, they
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:41.140]   think, "It's just this cold, it's just this arbitrary, mechanical, fatalistic choosing
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.140]   by God.
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.180]   It's not fair."
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.900]   They have to look at this.
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:54.940]   God's choosing is not just simply some lofty figure, some distant king saying, "I give
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:55.940]   you permission.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:56.940]   You can go to heaven.
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:57.940]   Fine by me."
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.900]   No, no.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:05.820]   This is Father figure coming to bring you into his home.
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.300]   That's God's election.
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:14.820]   That is so different from the mechanical, cold election that people think it may be.
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:15.820]   And this is to us.
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.580]   I mean, think about blessing.
[00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:21.580]   This is to us our blessing.
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:26.300]   For abandoned children, we have a father.
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.420]   You know, I have this quote from J.I. Packer.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:32.780]   I was reading his commentary on Ephesians and it's really awesome.
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:37.940]   And he says, "If you want to judge how well a person understands Christianity, find out
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:43.580]   how much he makes of the thought of being God's child and having God as his father.
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:47.740]   If this is not the thought that prompts and controls his worship and prayers and his whole
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:53.900]   outlook on life, it means he does not understand Christianity very well at all.
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:58.100]   For everything that Christ taught, everything that makes the New Testament new and better
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:02.980]   than the old, everything that is distinctly Christian as opposed to merely Jewish is summed
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.460]   up in the knowledge of the fatherhood of God.
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.820]   Father is a Christian's name for God."
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:10.820]   Right?
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:15.700]   That to us is great as blessing.
[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.620]   That to us is great as blessing.
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.540]   And so he repeats that multiple times in the book.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:21.900]   Scripture repeats that multiple times.
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:25.540]   We have an incredible blessing to be able to call him Abba Father.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.700]   What's more, there is being redeemed and forgiven.
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:30.780]   And for the sake of time, I want to challenge you.
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.500]   I challenge you with this question.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.500]   What is redemption?
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.500]   What is forgiveness?
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:35.500]   How are they different?
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:36.500]   Right?
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:41.780]   I want to highlight the fact that for us, redemption typically means like, "I overcame."
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:42.780]   Right?
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:47.140]   It's like, you know, back four years ago in the Olympics, I utterly failed.
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:50.500]   I tripped and I fell and never even made it to the goal line.
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.620]   This time around in the Olympics, I go on gold.
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.620]   Redemption.
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:55.620]   Right?
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:59.580]   Like that's typically redemption in our thought is you fail but you overcame.
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.980]   Now there is that kind of concept in Scripture.
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:06.180]   But Scripture's concept of redemption is even more rich than that.
[00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:10.820]   What you have to do is you have to look at where the times in the Bible he uses the word
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:11.820]   redeemed.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:16.220]   And typically what he says in the Scriptures is that he purchased you.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.220]   Right?
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.900]   He paid the price for you.
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:23.380]   And that's why even in this passage he says, "You have been redeemed through the blood,
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:29.060]   the payment of the priceless life of Christ."
[00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.460]   The payment's been made.
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:36.540]   Scripture talks about redeemed as individuals, let's say, who are slaves, who are owned.
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.080]   Redemption doesn't mean just simply like, "Woohoo, I'm free."
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.760]   Redemption means you have been bought under new ownership.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.520]   Redemption even in the, like, you know, kinsmen redeemer, right?
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.300]   You have somebody who passes away and now this person is without protection, without
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.140]   provision, without anything.
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.740]   But then someone comes to redeem.
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.900]   They claim this is mine.
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:57.900]   Right?
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:01.340]   Really rich, really rich concepts that we should look into.
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:07.940]   But the goal, again, the effect reminding us when we walk through this passage we should
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:13.460]   come out with the sense, "Oh my goodness, I am so blessed."
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.860]   Right?
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.700]   You should feel smothered.
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.220]   You should feel overjoyed.
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.740]   And you should feel like, "Oh my goodness, if I sat here and counted all the ways I'm
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:23.740]   never going to be done."
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:24.740]   Right?
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.220]   That's the thought we should have.
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:30.340]   And what's more, that's one of the conclusions that we have to make is that we find as a
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:35.220]   repetition in this passage that every blessing is in Christ.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.820]   It is in Christ and through Christ.
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.660]   Take a look at this again.
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:45.520]   Remember he says that every spiritual blessing is in the heavenly places in Christ just as
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.900]   he chose us in him.
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:48.900]   Right?
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:53.860]   In love he predestined us to adoptions as sons through Jesus Christ to himself.
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:57.420]   And then all this to the praise and glory of his grace which he freely bestowed on us
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.860]   in the beloved.
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:03.740]   In him we have redemption through his blood.
[00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:08.140]   There is no blessings for heaven outside of Christ.
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:10.900]   There is no eternal weight outside of Christ.
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:11.900]   Right?
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:16.340]   There is only one place we should be looking for things that last, for things that are
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.380]   weighty, for things that are valuable.
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:24.020]   When it comes to even your self-esteem, when it comes to even your identity, we as believers
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.580]   have to understand it is all wrapped up in Christ.
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:33.060]   And then the third point is all the blessings are in accord to his kind intention.
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:41.220]   And I wanted to make mention of this just briefly because man, praise be to God.
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:45.860]   Because one of the things we see highlighted in this passage is the manner by which he
[00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:48.620]   has expressed his heart.
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:50.300]   Right?
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:57.780]   I don't know if some of you have ever sat and took an account of how you perceive God.
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:03.660]   Where if God is this far, for a lot of people, God is this far and distant figure waiting
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:07.260]   for you to shape up.
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:10.100]   And then once you do, he might bless you.
[00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.100]   Do you ever feel like that?
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.220]   You're this long track on life.
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.100]   It's hard.
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.260]   Sometimes it's slow going and very difficult.
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:26.020]   God is watching from far, far away and he's waiting to see if you'll be faithful.
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:31.180]   And when you are, then God will help you.
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.100]   That is bad theology.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.340]   Right?
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.680]   Because look at the way that scripture is talking about the way God loves us.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:46.100]   He is freely lavishing his children with his kind intention.
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:49.460]   So if all of a sudden we have this moment where we're like, "Why in the world do I feel
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.460]   like this?
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.940]   Why in the world do I think like this?"
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:59.300]   We have to start asking the question, "Have my eyes been opened to appreciate and see
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.300]   what are the actual blessings that God is trying to give me?"
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:07.980]   The fact of the matter is scripture paints it like he's overflowing and freely giving
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.660]   it to you.
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:14.140]   Then in some ways I must be missing it.
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:19.300]   So by way of application, I want to ask you this question.
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:25.940]   Have you been seeing by faith what it means to be blessed by God?
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:30.460]   Have you been seeing by faith what it means to be spiritually and in heavenly fashion
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.340]   blessed by the Lord?
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.220]   And do you purely appreciate this?
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:40.300]   Have you been walking in a way where according to Psalm 1, "I am blessed, I am rich, I'm
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.660]   strong and healthy because I've been abiding in the presence of God.
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:48.440]   I've been meditating on his word and it's richly dwelling in me."
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:55.420]   Have you been operating by the faith that knowing I have been chosen by God Almighty
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:58.300]   to have a relationship with him?
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:07.740]   You are filthy rich because your father has everything at his disposal.
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.740]   Those are the ways we should be thinking.
[00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:11.100]   Do you believe this?
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:17.220]   I pray, I pray against this many times that I fall into this duped thinking when I see
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.660]   that guy with the truck that I want, when I see that guy with the house that I want,
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:24.660]   when I see that guy with the height, the intellect and the blessings that I want, then all of
[00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.620]   a sudden I conclude, "Man, that guy is blessed."
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:35.060]   I pray that our church and our Christian individuals do not interpret life like that.
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.940]   You see some guy, he eats all that he wants and he doesn't get fat.
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:42.860]   Man, he's blessed with great metabolism.
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:47.020]   What does it mean to be blessed for you?
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:52.100]   What have you concluded with your eyes?
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:56.620]   Because we need to be concluding and interpreting with faith.
[00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:02.460]   Every single one of us, by the mercies of God, when we have been united with Christ,
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:06.740]   we are blessed through and through, amen?
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:13.820]   And it is a challenge to us that we not walk by sight and that we not interpret the world
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:18.300]   of what is blessedness and what is not blessedness by what we see.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.580]   It has to be done in faith.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:27.820]   And that's why if you turn to a future portion, Ephesians chapter 1 verse 18, this is what
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:28.820]   he says.
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:33.660]   "I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened so that you will know what is
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:37.980]   the hope of his calling, what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:42.180]   and what is the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe.
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:45.660]   These are in accordance with the working of the strength of his might, which he brought
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:49.580]   about in Christ when he raised him up from the dead, seated him at the right hand in
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:51.540]   the heavenly places.
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:56.220]   Far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named,
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:01.860]   not only in this age, but also in the one to come."
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.900]   Christ is already there.
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:11.740]   And the spiritual truth for us is that by faith, it'll all be ours in inheritance.
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:17.820]   Christ is going to share his glory, his authority, the blessedness that he has with the Father
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:20.300]   in heaven, with every single believer.
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.180]   Though that to us is riches.
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:24.340]   There's another passage.
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:29.420]   "Even when you are dead and in our transgressions, you made us alive together with Christ.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:33.180]   By grace you have been saved and raised us up with him, seated us with him in the heavenly
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:37.780]   places in Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come he might show," what?
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:43.500]   "The surpassing riches of his grace and kindness towards us in Christ Jesus."
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:46.180]   Later on he says, "You're already there.
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:48.440]   It's as good as done."
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:52.860]   And so if any of us are feeling like, "Oh my goodness, I'm so sad, I'm so disappointed,
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:40:00.300]   I'm so joyless, I'm so joyless," we have to make sure that we are exercising this faith
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.580]   that we have.
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:07.120]   And so the last application is, after seeing a portion like this, we should be ready with
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:11.100]   gratitude in our hearts.
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.820]   If your mind is on the level, like you're just this technical dude and you're just like,
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.180]   "Wait a minute, I don't understand how choosing works.
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.100]   How does he elect?
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:24.580]   Did he long see us and then he's a," if you're like that, just take a moment to pause and
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:27.780]   stop.
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:31.100]   Just stop and listen to what he's saying.
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:38.900]   I have predestined to adopt you that I might have a unique relationship with you where
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.380]   I will be yours and you will be mine.
[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:45.140]   I will be your father and you will be my child.
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:48.620]   Why in the world do we sometimes, "Wait a minute, but how does that work?
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.460]   Why do we do that?
[00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.060]   One of them must not be listening."
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:59.400]   What we should do in application when we see stuff like that is we should thank him.
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:03.380]   Thank you for choosing me to have this unique relationship with you.
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.380]   Amen.
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:05.380]   Let's pray.
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:12.900]   Lord God, we want to thank you so much.
[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:16.340]   And Father, I pray that we would never grow tired, we would never grow weary, and we would
[00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:22.060]   never grow so accustomed to giving you thanks and praise and prayer that God may it never
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.060]   ever grow old to us.
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:31.400]   But Lord, may we be enriched, may our hearts be so thankful and overflowing with gratitude.
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:36.560]   God, you chose sinners, wretched sinners.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.200]   We can't even explain that.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:44.360]   We thank you so much that you operate according to your heart and your kind intention towards
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.400]   us.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.400]   We thank you, Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.400]   In Christ's name we pray.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:47.400]   Amen.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:57.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
