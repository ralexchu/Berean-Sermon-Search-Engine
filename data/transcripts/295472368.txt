[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.480]   You know, some of the best insights or best treasures in the scriptures are in places
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.560]   that we don't normally look.
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.640]   And I was just thinking, even last night, you know, this rarely happens now because
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.240]   people don't use cash.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.920]   But before when we used to use more cash, you know, every once in a while I would put
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.120]   on my suit, because I only wear the suit once a week and I would have money in here and
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.840]   I would forget about that suit for a while and I would put that suit back on and I would
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.320]   reach in and I would find a $20 bill or $10 bill and say, "Wow."
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.080]   You know, I felt like I won something.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.000]   That never happens now because we don't use cash.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.880]   So I felt like chapter 16 is one of those chapters that you typically don't think that
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.880]   there's anything there.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.800]   Paul is just saying bye.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.120]   You know, he said, "Greet this person, greet that person, greet this person," and then
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.240]   he finishes up the letter and then that's it.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.120]   So typically, by the time we get to chapter 15 in the Book of Romans, he's kind of wrapping
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.120]   up, right?
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.720]   Say hi to this person, I wish I can get there, when I get there, get some support, go to
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.720]   Spain.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.680]   And we've already seen in chapter 15 how much content is contained in that one chapter revealing
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.480]   his ministry, his heart, the different people who are engaged in his ministry.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.280]   And then we get to chapter 16, it's just a bunch of lists of names.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.200]   We're going to take about three, possibly four weeks in this chapter.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.840]   And the reason why is because there's insights into what God is doing at that particular
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.880]   time and we don't know a lot about, you know, a lot of the people on this list, but the
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.520]   few people that we do know on this list, it reveals a great amount of what God is doing
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.520]   in that midst.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.800]   And so I'm just going to pray for us and we'll jump right in, okay?
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.560]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for today.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.600]   We thank you for the beautiful weather.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:03.120]   We thank you, Father God, for just a constant patience and perseverance with us, Lord God,
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.120]   knowing all our failures, past, present, and future, that you've sent your only begotten
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.040]   Son to cover us with his righteousness.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.480]   I pray that that sacrifice, Lord God, would never become old.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.640]   It would never simply be dead theology, but it would be the fuel that causes us, Lord
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.800]   God, to run to you in every and all situation.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.760]   I pray that you would clear our minds, soften our hearts, help us, Lord God, to be eager
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.320]   listeners, Lord God, that we may be hearers and doers of your word.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.280]   We thank you in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.840]   If you've been reading through the Old Testament or if you've done that in the past, you probably
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.040]   already noticed that the Bible lists quite a few names, right?
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.920]   There's a list on the Old Testament.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.160]   In fact, when you get to the book of Numbers, you almost want to skip it because it's a
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.280]   book of numbers because it's a book of numbers of people.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.720]   So there's genealogy after genealogy, genealogy.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.520]   You see it in Genesis, you see it in Numbers, you see it in various books, and then they
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.480]   just have lists of names that go, you know, sometimes for pages.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.960]   So I don't know about you, but when I get to those passages, either I really slow down
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.320]   and examine these words or I end up just skimming it, right?
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.720]   But there's a reason why these names are listed there.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.840]   It's not, it isn't just there because, you know, these people are important to those
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.320]   people so we're just going to list it there.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.880]   I mean, God could have easily written the Bible without having their names and then,
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.800]   you know, to our knowledge, because we don't know who they are, it wouldn't have made any
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.680]   difference, at least we think, to the overall gospel message.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.960]   But there's a reason why these people are mentioned.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.960]   It's not random.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.760]   God didn't just say, "You know what, let's just stick their names up there, you know,
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.880]   and let them know that they're important to me," right?
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.240]   But then we don't know who they are.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.040]   There's a reason for that.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.680]   In fact, if you read over in the Bible, especially in the book of Revelation, it's repeated over
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.440]   again that every single soul's name is written in the book of life.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.560]   Every name, every single person's name.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.800]   The Bible talks about how God cares for us to the extent that He counts every strand
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   of hair, right?
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.880]   He knows if you have, you know, 50,000 pieces or 30,000 pieces, He knows.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.880]   He says He counts the hair.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:35.200]   So if God cares for our souls to that degree, wouldn't He be counting the souls' names?
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.000]   Who are these people?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.800]   Why are they there?
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.880]   What do their names and their presence in Paul's ministry teach us about God, about
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.640]   the gospel, and about what He's been doing?
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.440]   Just like the genealogy of Jesus, again, if you read the New Testament, you probably started
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.680]   the book of Matthew and list the genealogy.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.680]   Again, you skip to chapter two.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.760]   Yes, these are people that was in Jesus' genealogy, and then you start talking about the narrative,
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.860]   or you go to the book of Luke, and then you see the genealogy, and then you skip that.
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.320]   But those genealogies tell us a lot about God's redemptive history, what God's been
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.040]   doing to bring about Christ.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.360]   So every single one of those names connects Jesus to the promise in the book of Genesis,
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.720]   that the son of the woman is going to come and crush the head of the serpent.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.720]   And so all the genealogies and the names, all from Genesis all the way to the book of
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:34.040]   Matthew and the book of Luke, it connects God's faithfulness, despite the sinfulness
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.600]   of man, to bring about Christ.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.320]   The greatest thing that it teaches us, that it wasn't because of the great people.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.240]   It was because there was a great God behind these people that he fulfills his promise.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.520]   So every one of those names highlights redemptive history.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:59.160]   And in the same way, what we see in chapter 16, it is a background information of what
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:06.280]   has been happening and what God has been doing and how the gospel has been spreading.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.720]   In chapter 16, we have a list of 26 individuals.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.960]   Two people are not named, 24 are named.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.280]   There are two families and three house churches.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.680]   These are people that most people would never have known anything about.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.280]   My guess is you probably may have looked at this list, if you did, if you're an A+ student,
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:39.360]   you already came and at least skimmed over it, and you may have recognized two, or maybe
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.680]   four, or maybe five.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.440]   But majority of these people you probably have never heard of before.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.800]   Hopefully you'll know some of them after today.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.720]   What I want to highlight this morning is, first of all, the different groups of people
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.720]   that are mentioned here.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.840]   So we're going to talk about the females that are mentioned, Paul's family members that
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.080]   are mentioned in here, there are slaves, there are aristocrats, and then there's just one
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.560]   or two people that really are highlighted and it gives us a background information of
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.640]   what God's been doing.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.200]   So first thing that I want to mention about the different females that are mentioned here.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:20.880]   You have to understand, out of the 26 names, nine of them, nine of them are females.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.360]   More than a third of the list that are mentioned that Paul says to greet are females.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.720]   Now in our culture that means absolutely nothing.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.360]   It's like why aren't there 50%?
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.340]   That's the response that maybe our culture would say.
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.880]   But at this particular time, to have nine females mentioned as prominent members of
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.440]   the Roman church saying, "Hey, make sure you greet these ladies."
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:48.320]   I'm not going to, I think the names are already up there, so I'm not going to mention all
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.320]   of them.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.300]   But women at that time in history, in the Jewish culture and in the Roman culture and
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:59.240]   in the Greek culture, did not have the same kind of status that women have today in our
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.240]   culture.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.880]   Typically people say, without understanding the context, that if they read Apostle Paul's
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:13.160]   letters superficially, they say, "Apostle Paul is a male chauvinist because he talks
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.960]   about the order in the home, he talks about male leadership and the women to be learning
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.880]   and not to be teaching over men."
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.840]   And so they read that superficially and say, "Apostle Paul is a male chauvinist, no wonder
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.240]   the church is the way it is, backwards."
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.560]   In fact it's exactly the opposite.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:35.000]   It's because of the Judeo-Christian teaching that most of the countries today who have
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.680]   the background of Judeo-Christian teaching in history tend to be more elevating of women's
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.320]   status than the countries that don't have that background.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.480]   Now you can study that for yourselves.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.480]   Only the countries who tend to have greater value for women have at some point in their
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.880]   history Judeo-Christian values.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.700]   The reason why the women were elevated in society and were no longer treated like servants
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:08.360]   or property, a large part of that was because of the teaching and the practice of the early
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:12.000]   church.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.920]   Women were not meant to be seen, at least in that culture.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:21.160]   They were told by the Jewish law to be veiled when they were in public.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.640]   In fact, this is the exact Jewish oral tradition.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.400]   The oral law stated, "Let no one talk with a woman in the street, no, not with his own
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.560]   wife."
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.240]   Some of us look at, think of that and say, "Well, that sounds a lot like the Muslim community."
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:40.080]   And I have friends who are doing missions in some of these countries and they're not
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.080]   allowed to be out in public.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.680]   And if they are in public, they have to be completely veiled.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.920]   And this is today, we're not talking about 100 years ago.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:56.040]   It said women typically were meant, again, by tradition, by their law, that they weren't
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.160]   allowed to be out in public without some kind of chaperone.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.220]   The Eastern women of that time were discouraged to even go out in public at all.
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.560]   And you can understand the reason why in John chapter 4, when Jesus is speaking to the Samaritan
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.240]   woman, why she is surprised, even shocked, that a Jewish rabbi is speaking to her in
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.240]   public.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.480]   You know, I'm not going to go into all the different background information behind that,
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:25.140]   but here's a woman who was rejected by her own Samaritan people and a Jewish male is
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.960]   standing there in the middle of the day publicly talking to her.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.100]   So she's shocked.
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.800]   Why are you doing this?
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.800]   Right?
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.560]   Remember in chapter 3, Nicodemus is concerned about his reputation.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.080]   So he comes at night and then in chapter 4, the Samaritan woman is concerned about Jesus'
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.080]   reputation.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.680]   What are they going to say of you talking to me like this in public, a Samaritan woman?
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:52.200]   See, that was the era in which the Bible was being written.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:57.840]   In a traditional Jewish village, a young girl was never allowed to have any kind of education
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:03.240]   other than the education that mom would give her at home to cook and clean and take care
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:09.520]   of their children, and outside of that, they never had any kind of formal education.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:15.240]   The first century Jewish male, if you haven't been offended up to this point, you're going
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.900]   to be offended by this.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:23.960]   His daily prayer said, "Thank God I am not a Gentile slave or a woman."
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.600]   This was his daily prayer.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.760]   You look at the prayer book of the Jews of that time, that's actually written in their
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.700]   daily prayer.
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:38.720]   So you can see what the society looked like at that time.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:49.920]   Now if you take, again just logically from observation, if you take ethics and morality
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.920]   and value that God has given every human being out of the culture and you just allow your
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:00.000]   sinfulness to just reign free, what would happen?
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.100]   Whoever is strongest is going to end up dominating.
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.020]   If you have power, you suppress those who don't have power.
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.660]   If you're physically stronger, you bully the ones who don't have power.
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.900]   That's typically what happens if you let sin reign free.
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:20.980]   And if you look at, again, societies where Judeo-Christian values are not at the foundation
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:25.520]   upon which the South society was built, that's typically what happens.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:32.460]   We're not saying universally and to an equal amount, but that's typically what happens.
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:39.180]   The point of all of this is to say that what the gospel taught about men and women were
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.560]   radical.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:46.460]   It wasn't radical in suppressing women, it was radical in delivering them from the bondage
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.460]   that they were in.
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.900]   So when the scripture says that there is no difference between male or female, in our
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:58.740]   culture we say, "Of course, why do you even have to say that?"
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:03.820]   But a Jewish male of that time, when he heard there is no difference between male or female,
[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.780]   his response would have been, "What?
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.120]   How could that possibly be?
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:15.500]   Our whole culture, our whole prayer that we pray before God, thank God you didn't make
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:19.780]   me like them."
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:24.540]   What's interesting on this list, the very first name that Paul mentions is Phoebe.
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.620]   Clearly it's a female's name.
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.420]   He says she was a servant of Centria, which is near Corinth.
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.220]   It was a port city of Corinth.
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:38.420]   And the book of Romans was written in Corinth.
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:43.320]   So it's a popular understanding of where Phoebe fits into all of this is Phoebe was most likely
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.660]   the one who carried the Roman letter to Rome.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.100]   Paul probably gave it to her and she was acting as a messenger for Paul.
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:56.780]   And that's why he says, "When you greet Phoebe, make sure you take good care of her because
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.220]   she's coming to Rome."
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.100]   It says that she was a servant of this church.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:08.200]   And the word servant is diakonos, where it can be literally translated a servant or deacon.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:14.020]   So the translators, the commentators are divided whether this was a formal title or whether
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.900]   she's just described as a servant.
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.740]   But either the case, she was a very prominent member.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:23.380]   And it says that she was a helper, or in some of your translations, it says she was a patron.
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:29.460]   And so majority of the commentators believe that she was a very successful businesswoman.
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:34.380]   And because of her wealth, she was able to provide and support, and possibly she might
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.500]   have been going to Rome to do some business.
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.180]   And so Paul, knowing this, may have given the letter to her and say, "When you are headed
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.300]   over there, can you take this letter for me?"
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:52.020]   She was the carrier of the letter, and she was, again, the first name mentioned at the
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.580]   end of this letter saying, "Make sure you take good care of her."
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.660]   Again, in our culture, that means absolutely nothing.
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:04.340]   Remember I told you that whenever you see a list of names in the New Testament, it means
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.900]   that the first one that is mentioned is mentioned for a reason.
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.100]   Peter is there because the first name mentioned in the 12, because he's the leader, and he's
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.700]   always mentioned on the top.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:19.340]   So the fact that Apostle Paul, at the end of his letter, the first person that he mentions,
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.660]   the Phoebe, is significant.
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.260]   Because a Jewish male would have read that and think, "Phoebe."
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.180]   Of all the people that you could have mentioned, you mentioned Phoebe, right?
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.580]   Make sure you take good care of her.
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.900]   It would have been culturally shocking.
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:39.940]   It gives us a glimpse of what was happening, how the gospel was changing the culture at
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:40.940]   the time.
[00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.780]   Right off the bat, some of the most prominent members of the ones who were carrying and
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.740]   doing gospel ministry were women.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:54.260]   Secondly, Priscilla and Akilah, their names you probably heard before because they're
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.180]   mentioned about six different times in the New Testament.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:01.740]   But what's significant about that is among the six different times, four times Priscilla
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.260]   is mentioned first.
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.260]   And that is not random.
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.580]   There's a reason for that.
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.340]   Now why she was mentioned first, there's a debate.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:14.860]   Some believe that maybe she was mentioned first because she comes from a Roman background,
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:20.100]   and she came from a prominent family, and as a result of status, before she became a
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.840]   Christian that she was elevated first and people knew her first.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.820]   Some people think that maybe Priscilla was the more dominant one, right?
[00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:33.000]   A lot of times we think of husband and wives, and in a traditional conservative church,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.780]   we have male role and a women's role, and men are to lead and the women are to support
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.380]   and submit.
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.980]   And so a lot of the husbands struggle and wives struggle with what that looks like because
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:50.540]   a lot of times they project leadership at church or strong male leadership needs to
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.300]   look like this.
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.340]   And the husband needs to know the Bible better than the wife, and the husband needs to be
[00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.300]   more articulate than the wife in order for her to lead, but that's not the case.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:08.540]   In fact, that's not the case in reality, no matter if you believe that or reject that.
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:15.340]   The reality is there are many marriages where the wife is probably more gifted.
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.740]   That's not an opinion, that's a fact, right?
[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.520]   Because we can all see it, right?
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.700]   There's a lot of situations where the wife is more prominent, the wife is more outgoing,
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.580]   the husband may be not necessarily a submissive role, but he's not as gifted, maybe he's an
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:35.660]   extra introvert, and he has different gifts.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:40.100]   So that may be a reason why Priscilla is more prominent.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:45.740]   I think another reason may be because these two people were tent makers, and they were
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.180]   heavily involved in business.
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:52.620]   Again, the first two people that are mentioned here are business people.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.860]   And because they were very prominent business people, that there are times maybe when Priscilla
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:02.620]   went to one state, one city, one to another city, and Priscilla may have been better known
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:07.420]   in those four places that Paul mentions where her name is first.
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:12.180]   And possibly the husband was mentioned first than the others because he was more prominent
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.360]   over there as a businessman.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:19.860]   We don't know for sure, but the fact that Priscilla is mentioned first to begin with,
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:29.100]   it already tells us that the culture of that time was already changing because of the gospel.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:35.480]   Paul met these two people in the context of doing ministry, because he was selling tents,
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:40.460]   and Paul had to learn to make and sell tents, and as a result of their business venture,
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.740]   they were able to partner together in ministry.
[00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:49.700]   Priscilla and Achilla, they were the ones who meet Apollos in Acts chapter 18, and they
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.260]   were the ones who bring Apollos to Christ.
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.700]   He's teaching all these things about the Messiah, and they realize that he doesn't know the
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.460]   real Jesus.
[00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.980]   So in Acts chapter 18, they pull him aside and instruct him, "This Jesus that you're
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.500]   talking about, he already came."
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:07.660]   So they're the ones who bring Apollos to Christ.
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:13.020]   And it's believed that the reason why Apollos was so prominent in Corinth, remember in the
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.320]   book of Corinth?
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:19.020]   Some people were loyal to Apollos, some people to Paul, some people to Jesus, right?
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.940]   And the reason why Apollos had such a prominent ministry in Corinth was because Priscilla
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.620]   and Achilla were members in Corinth.
[00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:31.220]   So they believed that they were the ones who probably brought Apollos and introduced them,
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.860]   and then that kind of caused some friction in the Corinthian church.
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.900]   So these people were very prominent in the early church.
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:44.140]   Paul, in fact, goes further and says, "These people risked their neck for me."
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:50.140]   They literally risked their neck because Apostle Paul ended up having his neck chopped off.
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:54.140]   Many of the early Christians of that time, because of their preaching of the gospel and
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.760]   involvement with the ministry, they had their necks chopped off.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:03.100]   So Paul literally says that these people were not just partnering and giving me money, they
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.380]   ran with me.
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:09.420]   And as prominent, wealthy business people, that they risked their lives to do this.
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.460]   Again, they were business people.
[00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.740]   Usually we think, "I want to serve God.
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.100]   I want to go to seminary and go overseas."
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:23.100]   All of these things are great, but you don't have to be a full-time pastor to be a passionate
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.100]   worker for Christ.
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:28.780]   The first two people that he mentions are business people in the context of using their
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:29.780]   money.
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:35.140]   In fact, the first home that is mentioned in Corinth where they had the first church
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.300]   was in their home.
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:42.980]   So again, all of these things kind of point to the fact that the culture in the early
[00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:43.980]   church was changed.
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.260]   The gospel was not only having an effect on what's happening on Sunday, it was changing
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.100]   the culture completely.
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:54.580]   Their paradigm of how they looked at the value of human beings.
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.620]   We see Mary, Paul says, who said that she worked very hard.
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:05.860]   We see these two ladies, Triphinae and Triphosa, and they believed that these were twins because
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.060]   this is typically how they named twins at the time, similar names.
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:15.340]   I have no idea why they did that because it's confusing as it is.
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.340]   But it was their custom that if twins came out, they would have similar names.
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:22.700]   So they believed that it was twin sisters who together served the gospel.
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.540]   And what's interesting was their names literally means delicate and dainty.
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:34.900]   So these delicate and dainty ladies were serving the Lord together.
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:40.220]   What we know about the significance of women on this list was women were made a significant
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.700]   part of the early Christian church.
[00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.220]   That's a fact.
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:48.620]   We know that from a systematic study of the New Testament, not just this passage.
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:53.340]   Women were given the same access to God that men enjoyed.
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:54.540]   That's a fact.
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.820]   When Christ came, there was no outer court, inner court.
[00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:02.500]   When the curtain to the Holy of Holies was ripped, all the Gentiles, everyone who had
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:08.220]   to be stationed outside a certain distance from the holy place of God, all of a sudden,
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.500]   all of that is wiped out.
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:14.100]   Jews, Gentiles, male or female, all had the same access to God.
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.580]   And this is all because of the gospel.
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:21.580]   Thirdly, women engaged in significant ministry.
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.520]   This doesn't mean that there's no role for men.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.660]   There's no separate role for women.
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:31.940]   But we typically think that to be submissive, to learn in quietness means, or a lot of people
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.140]   think that it means that you don't get involved with ministry, you just stay home and take
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.260]   care of your children.
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.220]   And that's not what we see in the New Testament.
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:45.060]   It's talking about submissiveness in attitude, which we are all called to do.
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:50.980]   We're all called to elevate Christ and be submissive in attitude.
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:55.420]   It's just that the women were called to do so in the context of the home.
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:02.380]   But we know that in application, that women were very active in the gospel ministry.
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.540]   Let me get to the second part.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.540]   Paul's relatives.
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:09.460]   Again, these are all things that we typically don't think about.
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.620]   But it gives us a huge understanding of the background.
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:20.020]   Andronicus, Junia, Herodian, Jason, Sospater were all called kinsmen of Paul.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.460]   Now, the word kinsmen could refer to fellow Jews.
[00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:27.940]   But the reason why the commentators believe that this is not talking about Jewish people
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:33.220]   is because there are other lists of Jewish people on this list that he doesn't call kinsmen.
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:38.780]   And there's good reasons to believe that Paul is talking about his personal relatives.
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:42.700]   And it only makes sense because, think about it in practice, right?
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:48.740]   Now, I'm not going to ask here, but how many of you got saved because a brother or sister,
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:53.540]   mother, father, aunt, uncle shared the gospel with you?
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:59.180]   How many of you in this church, which I know for a fact, were brought to Christ because
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.140]   of somebody in your family member?
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:06.700]   And many, like in our church, we have a lot of brothers and sisters or brother, brother
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.420]   or sister, sister.
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.100]   And then it goes even further than that.
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.460]   Sometimes you invite your aunt and uncle or your father and mother.
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:16.420]   And we have a lot of people come to church because of the connection we have with family
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.420]   members.
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.140]   And it was no different in the early church.
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:25.420]   When somebody came to Christ, the people who initially benefited the most were the people
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.420]   who were the closest to them.
[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:31.540]   And the people who were the closest to them were family members.
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.260]   And so we see that with Apostle Paul.
[00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:40.460]   Andronicus Junius, it says they became Christians prior to Paul in verse 7, that they met the
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.500]   Lord before Paul.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.420]   So Paul probably didn't even know, right?
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:50.340]   He probably didn't know, or my guess is that he was actively pursuing Christians on the
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:55.460]   way to Damascus, not realizing that he had a family member who were already a Christian,
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:25:00.100]   that if he didn't convert, may have one day ran into maybe his aunt, uncle, or cousin
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.140]   and had to persecute them too.
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:05.100]   Because they said they came to Christ first.
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.680]   Herodian.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:13.200]   He may have been a freed slave from the King Herod.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:18.100]   So typically when a slave who was prominent in that home was freed, he would take on the
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:22.380]   name of the one that he served, and he would be elevated because of the connection with
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.540]   the king.
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:30.660]   And so Herodian may have been a servant in the kingdom of Herod who was freed.
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:34.200]   Now, why is this important?
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:38.380]   It's important because we know that Apostle Paul came from a very prominent home.
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.220]   Remember when Paul was being whooped, right?
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.680]   He's being whooped, and then he says, "Can you do this to a Roman?"
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.480]   And the Roman guard freaks out because by law he can get into trouble.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.340]   He said, "I bought my citizenship.
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.340]   How did you get it?"
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.920]   And Paul says, "I was born into it."
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.120]   So we don't know the connection.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.920]   We just think maybe his father was a very successful businessman and something happened,
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.580]   and as a result his family got elevated.
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.540]   But this kind of gives us a glimpse.
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:10.160]   If he had a relative who was a Herodian, there's a chance that all the people in his line all
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.720]   of a sudden got elevated and had special favor from the Romans.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:18.580]   And that may be the reason why Paul had Roman citizenship.
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:23.360]   We know that the first four disciples, they were brothers.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:31.600]   Jesus' brother James himself, after the resurrection, becomes one of the prominent leaders of Jerusalem.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:38.560]   Jesus' ministry, many of the ones who did the background work supporting the disciples
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:44.320]   were the moms and aunts of the disciples.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:50.800]   The people who first benefit most are the ones who are the nearest.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:56.000]   That's why in 1 Corinthians 7, 14, it says, "For the unbelieving husband is sanctified
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   through his wife."
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.560]   It doesn't mean that an unbelieving husband becomes a Christian, but it says because of
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:06.160]   her presence in the husband's life, he's the first to benefit because he's going to be
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.520]   able to hear the gospel and see the gospel being practiced in their life.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.240]   The aroma of Christ came into that home.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.240]   That's what he means.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:18.960]   So that's why he says, "Don't separate because they are sanctified because of you."
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:24.040]   Acts chapter 16, 30, of the jailer, he said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.080]   saved and your household."
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.760]   Now it doesn't mean that if one person becomes saved, the whole household becomes saved.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.800]   What he means is that the gospel comes into your home.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:36.880]   Your whole home benefits from it.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:46.720]   Now again, the significance of all of this is that you could see how the gospel is not
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:51.040]   only working in Paul's life and establishing churches, you can see how it's penetrating
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.800]   into homes.
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:28:00.320]   And as a result of that, it created tremendous chaos.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:06.480]   And it either forced the family members to either embrace Christ or divided homes.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.760]   That's exactly what the scripture says.
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:17.440]   I mean, I don't know about you, but as I was studying all this list, again, to me, I don't
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.560]   know how it is for you, but to me it was like finding 20 bucks.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.400]   It's like, "Wow."
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.280]   I've preached through Romans before, but I didn't take this kind of time in chapter 16.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.080]   I might have given one message.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.880]   But it's like, "Oh, maybe I'll stay a little bit longer."
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:38.240]   I'm covering 16 verses today, but every single one of these names, we can go in depth and
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.000]   see what God was doing in their ministry.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.360]   And the reason why I want to do that is because outside of what we're doing today, you probably
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.080]   will never hear them again.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.920]   Most likely, that's my guess.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.140]   But these names are in here for a reason.
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:56.640]   God wants us to see something in these names.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.040]   There's another group of people that are mentioned here that you would have never heard in any
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.040]   other context.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.040]   They were slaves.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:13.040]   Amphiletus, Urbanus, Hermes, Philagus, Julia, they were all common slave names.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.040]   The reason that we know that they were slave names is because once a slave became free,
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.040]   they would change their name.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:22.040]   So the fact that they retained their slave names meant that they were probably still
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.040]   slaves.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:29.040]   Slaves in the first century, if women didn't have any rights, the slaves didn't have any
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.040]   at all.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.040]   They were considered property.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:38.040]   They were seen basically like cattle.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:44.540]   So if you happen to have a bad, evil master, he can do with that person physically and
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:48.560]   even sexually whatever he wanted legally.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.640]   He had the power to carry out capital punishment on his slave anytime he wanted.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.580]   He had absolute power over these slaves.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:01.520]   So the fact that there are slaves that are mentioned, there's about five or six different
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:05.700]   slaves that are mentioned in this list of people who are prominently helping Apostle
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:12.080]   Paul do the gospel ministry would have been mind-blowing to the early church.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.480]   It would have been mind-blowing to anybody of that culture.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:22.400]   It's like slaves are prominent members and enough that Paul, an apostle of Christ, a
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:27.960]   Roman citizen, possibly a member of the Sanhedrin, mentions them in this prominent letter.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:32.920]   Obviously, it wasn't Apostle Paul, it was the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.760]   These people are precious to Paul because they're precious to our God.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:37.960]   That's why their names are mentioned.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:44.920]   In fact, the whole letter is written in Philemon, where he's introducing his slave back to his
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.000]   former master, which he ripped off before he became a Christian.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.480]   He stole things and he ran away and he meets Christ in prison and then he converts and
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.960]   then Paul is trying to get him reconciled back to his master.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.160]   And the whole letter is written to reconcile him back to his master.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:04.120]   You have to understand that a runaway slave, if he was caught, it would have automatically
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.920]   meant capital punishment.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:12.920]   So for Onesimus to voluntarily go back to meet his master was literally to risk his
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:13.920]   life.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.280]   And that's why Paul is writing this letter.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:20.920]   Receive him not as your slave, but as a brother now, because both of you have received the
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:21.920]   grace of God.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:28.640]   Outside of the grace of God, it would have been ridiculous to even think of asking a
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:32.080]   runaway slave to go back.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.880]   Not only by his master, but think of all the non-Christians around him that may have not
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.400]   converted seeing him come back.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.360]   How could he possibly be restored?
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:46.560]   This is something that you would never even imagine.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.480]   How can that be?
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:57.120]   How can that person who did that to you come back voluntarily to be restored?
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:04.760]   And then the former master who lost not only his face, but money, maybe even status as
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.040]   a result of that, just receive him as a brother.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.760]   And Apostle Paul says, "Do this for me.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.760]   I've done so much for you.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:16.360]   I'm not going to force you, but do this for me because of what Christ has done for you."
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:23.480]   I mean, that letter in and of itself, it cannot be written in any other context outside of
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.040]   what Christ has done.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:31.200]   These are things that we don't normally think about or talk about, but that was the power
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.600]   of the gospel.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.680]   This is not by human effort.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.160]   This is not because somebody determined, "I'm going to be a good person."
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:43.240]   It wasn't because they were taught good ethics at some Jewish synagogue.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.240]   They were born again.
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.440]   They're new creatures.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:50.440]   Only new creatures under the grace of God could possibly even think to do this.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.720]   That's what this letter represents.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:56.720]   In Galatians 3, 26 to 28, "For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:01.440]   For all of you who are baptized into Christ have clothed yourself with Christ.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.880]   There is neither Jew nor Greek.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.920]   There is neither slave nor free.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.200]   There is neither male or female.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.240]   For you are all one in Christ Jesus."
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:16.640]   Again, we recite this passage so often in the New Testament and we think about the oneness
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.080]   of the church, how we need to be united.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:23.840]   Imagine the context in which this verse is written.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:29.000]   That's no different than us talking about how terrorists who came and bombed our house
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.520]   and then all of a sudden you fall asleep for about a month and you wake up and then you
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.920]   say they're united.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.560]   We're worshiping the same God, right?
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.560]   We're all united.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:41.120]   We're all one.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:45.080]   Only the power of the gospel has the ability to do that.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:50.600]   Only people who have been absolutely transformed from inside out could even think that this
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.200]   is possible.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:57.200]   We don't need to look to the scripture to see that.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:01.000]   There's people in this room, maybe some of you.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:09.580]   You have been forgiven some horrendous sin that you would never share to anybody else.
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.580]   And you know that.
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:11.640]   And God knows that.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.120]   We may not know.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:19.160]   There are some people who have committed some horrendous sin in your life.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.520]   Humanly speaking, how can you possibly forgive these people?
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.800]   It is unrighteous to do so.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:30.680]   But the only reason why we would even entertain reconciling with those people is because of
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.240]   what Christ has done.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.480]   That's the power of the gospel.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.680]   That's what we see here on this list.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:45.960]   Just a mention of their names when you really think about what this means.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.120]   This is what the gospel is doing in the early church.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:50.120]   They were aristocrats.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:54.800]   Apellas was in the household of Aristobulus.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:35:04.000]   That's probably not how it's pronounced, but for now.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.560]   He was a grandson of Herod the Great, who was a friend of the emperor Claudius.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:14.360]   So it wasn't just the poor slaves and the disenfranchised, the misfits of culture who
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.380]   became Christians, which a lot of people think, "Well, Christianity took off because everybody
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:23.200]   was poor and Jesus promised wealth and health, and that's why everybody became Christian."
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.640]   It wasn't the truth at all.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.160]   There were a lot of very prominent people.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:35.640]   In fact, the last years of Apostle Paul's life, he stood before kings and governors
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:41.360]   and wealthy, and he stood before them preaching the gospel until the day he died.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:51.440]   Narcissus was a rich, powerful freedman who many believe was the direct secretary of Emperor
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.600]   Claudius.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.680]   He was put to death during Nero's reign.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:03.280]   In fact, Paul says in Philippians 4.22, he says, "All the saints greet you, especially
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.120]   those of Caesar's household."
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.920]   So the gospel did not only penetrate to the poor and the lowly, the gospel is also penetrating
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.880]   into Caesar's household.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:17.080]   So it wasn't just limited to people who are desperate.
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:22.280]   The power of the gospel was penetrating into places that you would have never thought.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:26.200]   And that's the problem that we have sometimes in our culture, that we tend to target the
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:32.000]   gospel to people that we think are in need.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.200]   You go on campus and you want to share the gospel with somebody, and you target people
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.400]   that you think you have some sort of advantage over.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.320]   So if they're older than you, don't talk to them.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.580]   They're not going to take you seriously.
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:49.960]   If they're rich and you happen to be poorer, that's not your position.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:54.680]   So we have a tendency to target people that we think that we have some kind of advantage
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.680]   over.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.120]   We're older than them, more experienced than them, we have more money than them, we have
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.600]   better standing than them.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:05.100]   So we have something to teach them.
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:10.600]   And then if we want to reach the aristocrats, we need to reach Caesar.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.880]   The gospel in and of itself is foolishness to those who are perishing, but it is a power
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.000]   of God unto those who are being saved.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.560]   It is not us.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.440]   It is not the messenger where the authority comes from.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:27.400]   It is not because we are experienced, we're wealthy, and we're more educated or older
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.360]   that I have something to say to you because I have all this experience.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.680]   My authority does not come from that.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.080]   I could be dead wrong.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.200]   The only authority I have is the authority that comes through me in Christ.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:42.840]   So the gospel came in and it penetrated even to the highest of places.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.760]   And this was happening in the early church.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.160]   Other notable names as I wrap up.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:56.080]   Eponatus, he's mentioned in verse 5 as a man who was committed, he was called the first
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:00.400]   fruit of Asia.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:04.200]   First fruit of Asia, meaning that he was probably the first convert of many converts.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:08.320]   You have to understand the persecution that was taking place in Asia was so tremendous
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.040]   the Holy Spirit told him not to go there for a period.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.840]   But when he finally does arrive, he says Eponatus was the first convert.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:22.280]   And now he's residing in Rome, all for the purpose of doing mission work.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:25.080]   And these are common people, business people, right?
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.600]   These were not apostles.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.640]   These were not committed missionaries.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:33.200]   These are all just regular, normal people who are affected by the gospel, who have shifted
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.200]   their lives around in order for the gospel ministry.
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.240]   I'm going to mention these names.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.800]   We don't know much about these people at all, but I'm going to mention them.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.600]   I'm going to butcher their names.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:56.200]   Asinicritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobus, Hermes, Philagus, Julia, Nerus, and his sister Olympus,
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.840]   and all the saints with him.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:02.720]   The reason why I mentioned their name is because their names are important to God.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.720]   We don't know much.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.560]   Maybe in the future, maybe there's some more archaeology will come out and we'll know more
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:11.080]   about them, but these are important to God and they're mentioned in the scripture, so
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.080]   I mentioned them to you.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:17.840]   I want to mention one other name before I wrap up this morning.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.920]   Rufus.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:27.600]   Rufus's name first comes to us in Mark chapter 15, 21.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.200]   And let me read that passage to you.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:34.800]   And this is a text where Jesus is carrying his cross to Golgotha, and because he is stumbling,
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:41.560]   the Roman guards make Simon, the Cyrene, to take up the cross and carry it for him because
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:45.000]   he couldn't finish this path.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.200]   And this is where Rufus comes in.
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.440]   Mark chapter 15, 21.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:53.980]   They pressed into service a passerby coming from the country, Simon Cyrene, the father
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:59.920]   of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:06.840]   Now the reason why we believe that this Rufus in Mark chapter 15 is the same Rufus in chapter
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:14.060]   16 is because Rufus, the gospel of Mark, was written in Rome.
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:21.740]   So Mark would have been very familiar with Rufus, Alexander, his mom, and his father.
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:27.620]   So the church fathers believed, and most commentators believe, that this is the same Rufus.
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:35.460]   And what it tells us is that random act of Simon, the Cyrene, that we never hear ever
[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:40.620]   again in Scripture, that ends up picking up the cross, ends up sharing the gospel with
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:45.000]   his two children who are prominent enough where Apostle Paul would mention them by name.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.340]   And not only does he mention Rufus, he mentions the mother who was involved.
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:52.100]   And he says, not only is she your mother, but she's also my mother because she was very
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.540]   active in supporting Apostle Paul's ministry.
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:41:02.020]   So that one act, it doesn't say Simon picked up the cross and took him, and then as a result
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:05.660]   of seeing Jesus crucified, he gave his life to Christ and became a great missionary.
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:08.260]   It doesn't tell us any of that.
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.620]   It's just a random story.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:15.200]   Simon, who just came to watch what's going on here, picks up the cross, and somehow,
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.060]   we don't know how, we don't know who shared the gospel with him.
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:22.680]   Somehow he becomes a Christian, goes back, shares the gospel with these two prominent
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.800]   sons, Alexander and Rufus.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.960]   And then the mother becomes a Christian, and they join in the gospel ministry in the early
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.140]   church.
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:37.280]   There is nothing that is in Scripture that is there for no reason.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:39.620]   We just haven't dug far enough.
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:42.700]   It's there.
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.780]   What does all of this teach us?
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:52.340]   Well, the power of the gospel reach all different walks of life.
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:58.040]   Now why this is important is because we use marketing techniques to think that if we use
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:02.500]   human wisdom and marketing, if we can, that person will submit if we do this, and that
[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:06.500]   person will be interested if we do that, and we use all kinds of techniques, human effort
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:09.740]   to bring people in.
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:14.020]   But the power of the gospel is not human ingenuity.
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:17.860]   The power of the gospel isn't because we found the right technique or the right person
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:19.780]   to do the right thing.
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:22.380]   The power of the gospel goes beyond who we are.
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:26.780]   There is a reason why God deliberately chooses the foolish in the world to dumbfound the
[00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:32.580]   wise, because the whole rebellion of mankind is to glorify himself.
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:37.860]   So even the way that the gospel reaches people, he uses people that people normally think,
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:41.200]   "That guy, why would you pick those people?"
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:45.220]   And when Apostle Paul, Apostle Peter and the disciples stood up and started preaching the
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:48.140]   gospel in the book of Acts, they were amazed.
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.620]   Remember what they were amazed by?
[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:54.540]   These lowly fishermen were able to preach with such boldness, and then they realized
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:57.780]   that these were disciples of Jesus.
[00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:01.340]   They gave credit to Jesus, because that's where the power lied.
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:07.960]   And so first and foremost, we see that the power of the gospel reached all walks of life.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.740]   It wasn't human ingenuity.
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:14.980]   Secondly, that the gospel brought unity among people where their lives would have never
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:18.540]   crossed, and that's the beauty of the church.
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:27.700]   Our unity isn't based upon our common background or our wealth or our culture or our language.
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.660]   There's something far beyond that that unites us.
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:34.580]   I mean, I can go to places in India.
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:41.780]   I can go to places in Europe and in the remotest parts of Asia, and I see somebody reading
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.660]   the scripture.
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:46.380]   All of a sudden, there's a connection.
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:51.260]   And I remember early on when we used to go to China, and this is very early on in China
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:59.460]   in I think maybe 1999 or year 2000, and this was in Harbin, China.
[00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:04.560]   I was sitting in a McDonald's and just reading the scriptures, doing my devotions early in
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.260]   the morning.
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:11.620]   And this lady was walking by the window with her daughter, and she was, you know, just
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:14.020]   a brisk walk because it was cold.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:19.060]   And she was walking, and then she saw my Bible, and I could see her lifting her head, just
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.100]   backtracking with her daughter, you know.
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:25.340]   And I was, "Oh, shoot, you know, maybe I'm going to get in trouble."
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:29.340]   And then she literally just stared at me for about a minute.
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:32.180]   It was really awkward.
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:33.180]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.900]   Because I didn't know who she was.
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:37.220]   I didn't know what she was doing.
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:42.820]   But I was sitting there reading the scripture, and she was there, and she was looking at
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:46.260]   me, and I was looking at her, and then she was looking at my Bible, and then she was
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.420]   looking at her daughter, and then I was looking at her daughter.
[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:50.700]   I was like, "What is going on?"
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.460]   And then I saw what was going on.
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:57.740]   I saw that little cross of a necklace that she had on, and I could tell she was telling
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:01.820]   her daughter, "Look, another Christian."
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:06.620]   And that awkward moment, all of a sudden, just heart warmed another sister that walked
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:10.180]   by, just by seeing the scripture.
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:13.500]   There was a koinonia.
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:18.260]   We had fellowship at McDonald's.
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:21.020]   That's the power of the cross.
[00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:24.780]   People who are disenfranchised, people who don't fit into this world, people who are
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:31.340]   aristocrats, slaves, runaway slaves, former masters, Gentiles, Jews, Pharisees, tax collectors,
[00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:37.380]   prostitutes, all saved by the grace of God, sitting together, calling each other brothers
[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:41.540]   and sisters in Christ, knowing that we live in a fallen world, but one day we will be
[00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:46.820]   in heaven together for eternity because we have the same Father.
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:49.340]   That's the power of the gospel.
[00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:50.620]   That's what this list teaches us.
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:55.820]   Third and finally, that the gospel ministry was carried out by many people without fanfare.
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:00.740]   When we think about the gospel, we typically think about Apostle Paul, Apostle Peter, the
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:06.060]   apostles, how they gave their life, but there were hundreds and thousands of people without
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:13.060]   glory, without fame, without knowledge of anything else outside of that particular time.
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:18.780]   In fact, even today, when we think about great men of God, we think of these great conference
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:27.060]   speakers who wrote books, but 99% of all the gospel ministries are happening in the background
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.620]   with people who have no name.
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:36.140]   When they die, no one is going to venerate them, no one's going to remember them, but
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:42.300]   they're going to be gone, but their names are written in the book of life.
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:44.700]   That's the power of the cross.
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:52.980]   Not only did Christ die for me, but I can die for him without name, without fanfare.
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.540]   I don't have to be the greatest.
[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:59.860]   No one has to know me because my father knows me.
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:02.060]   My father loves me.
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:04.700]   My father cares for me.
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:07.900]   And that's the power that delivers us from ourselves.
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:14.460]   Because the thing that kills us more than anything else is ourselves.
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:19.620]   Our desire to be somebody, our desire to be recognized, our desire to be better than our
[00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.300]   neighbors.
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:25.820]   Even as Christians, we come to church and we compete with one another internally, not
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:29.820]   externally, internally, because there's some of that world that's still sitting in us that
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:35.540]   even as I preach the gospel, I want to be a great preacher.
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:42.420]   We all want to be Apostle Paul, but nobody wants to be Jeremiah, the weeping prophet.
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:47.580]   The gospel ministry happened with all of these people, and there are tons of people that
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:53.020]   are not even mentioned in this letter, and God used every single one of them to spread
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.940]   the gospel.
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:48:01.420]   So my encouragement to you, again, chapter 16 is one of those, you know, like you just,
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:03.020]   you just, you know, what do they call it?
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:04.020]   The fan reading?
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:09.260]   You turn on the fan and the page just rolls, and you can say you read it because your eyes
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:11.860]   saw it, but you don't really know what's in there.
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:16.640]   The chapter 16 is one of those chapters, but there's treasures in here because every single
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.700]   one of these souls are precious to God.
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:27.220]   So my encouragement, as I, again, let me ask our praise team to come up.
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:31.180]   You know, whenever we think of Christianity or I'm going to do something great for God,
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:35.860]   we automatically think of missions or, you know, be a pastor or do something, like I'm
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:42.700]   going to go do this and that, but so much of God's work is just men and women, business
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:50.380]   people, engineers, students, stay-at-home moms, just being faithful, and people who
[00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:56.220]   have been affected by the cross just doing what God told them to do on a day-to-day basis.
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:49:03.440]   So my prayer for our church is, yes, let's thank God for men like Apostle Paul.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:08.460]   Let's thank God for people who are being venerated, writing books, and challenging our generation,
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:13.140]   but don't forget the 99.9% of the people who are faithfully serving God in the background,
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:16.720]   which many of you may be as well, right?
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:20.180]   Let's come to the Lord and be faithful as these men and women were faithful.
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:21.700]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leaves.
