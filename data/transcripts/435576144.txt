[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.980]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 8.
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.400]   We're continuing our study in the book of Hebrews.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.560]   Hebrews chapter 8, we're going to be reading from verse 7 through verse 13.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.840]   A new covenant in Christ.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:24.440]   Hebrews chapter 8, verses 7 through 13.
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.400]   And reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.280]   For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion sought for
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.600]   a second.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.840]   For finding fault with them, he says, "Behold, days are coming," says the Lord, "when I will
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.640]   effect a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.520]   Not like the covenant which I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.040]   hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.480]   For they did not continue in my covenant, and I did not care for them," says the Lord.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.600]   For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.760]   After those days, says the Lord, "I will put my laws into their minds, and I will write
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.120]   them on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.000]   And they shall not teach everyone his fellow citizen, and everyone his brother, saying,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.920]   'Know the Lord, for all will know me, from the least to the greatest of them.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.040]   For I will be merciful to their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more.'"
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.040]   Let's pray.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.200]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your anointing and your Holy Spirit to cause us to listen
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.800]   and understand and apply these truths, Lord God, in our lives.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.440]   Help us, Lord God, to have clarity of thought, clarity of heart, that you are the potter
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.080]   and we are the clay, that you would mold us as you desire.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.480]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:43.200]   You know, as a pastor, you know, Apostle Paul is one of those men that I see in Scripture
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.520]   that gives a tremendous encouragement.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:53.000]   And obviously, he wrote so many of these letters, and we, you know, dissect his personality,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.960]   his writings, his vocabulary, and so we know much about Apostle Paul.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.680]   And typically, when men think about going into ministry, we often talk about Apostle
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.560]   Paul's ministry and his strategy, how he preached the gospel, what cities did he go to, how
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.040]   did he handle suffering and discouragement.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:17.400]   But aside from Apostle Paul, there are many great men that God has used to fulfill his
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.400]   purpose.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.320]   In fact, the majority of people's ministry doesn't look anything like Apostle Paul.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.160]   When we think of Apostle Paul, you see this man, even though he lived a short life, he
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.880]   went from city to city and established dozens of cities.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.720]   And again, at the end of his life, I mean, he's credited to bringing the gospel to basically
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.080]   that whole region.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.240]   But there are many people who have labored and preached without seeing any fruit in their
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.240]   life.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.600]   In fact, I would say that more than not, people who enter into full-time ministry live their
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.800]   whole lives frustrated and then die frustrated because they didn't see the fruit that they
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   desired.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.400]   And one of the men that represents that more than anybody else in the Bible is probably
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   Jeremiah.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.680]   You know, Jeremiah is known as a weeping prophet.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.400]   He's the author of the book Lamentation.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.280]   I mean, the book is Lamentations for a reason, because the whole book is lamenting.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.920]   Book of Jeremiah is written in the context of bringing judgment to the nation of Israel,
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.920]   the southern kingdom.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.080]   The northern kingdom already fell into the Assyrians, and then the southern kingdom has
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.320]   outlasted them because they had a few good people.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.160]   But in the end, their sins was going to bring about the judgment of God, and Jeremiah's
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.760]   whole ministry was to warn them about the judgment that's coming.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.680]   And so these verses in Jeremiah 27 through 8, it captures his heart and why he's called
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.120]   the weeping prophet.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.520]   He says, "Oh Lord, you have deceived me, and I was deceived.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.560]   You have overcome me and prevailed, and I have become a laughingstock all day long.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.200]   Everyone mocks me, for each time I speak, I cry aloud.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.960]   I proclaim violence and destruction, because for me, the word of the Lord has resulted
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.360]   in reproach and derision all day long."
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.520]   I've only taken two verses, but this is sort of what Jeremiah's ministry was like all throughout
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.520]   his life.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.920]   And then he never sees revival.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.280]   The reward for his ministry and his suffering is that judgment does come.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.520]   And then they go into captivity, and it isn't until years later they look back and say,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.800]   "Wow, Jeremiah was really speaking about God.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.440]   He was the prophet, but during his life, all he saw was suffering."
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.480]   Who would want to go into ministry if that's what ministry looks like?
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.480]   Most people think of the glory, you know, the Apostle Paul planting churches, going
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.680]   from place to place, and revival breaking out everywhere.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.120]   But majority of the people who diligently serve God, serve God simply out of obedience,
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.000]   whether they bear fruit or not.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.960]   But even Jeremiah, even in the book of Jeremiah, he was able to persevere, because even though
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.800]   he was preaching about the judgment, God was prophesying through him that he was not going
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.600]   to forget about them, that he's going to remain faithful.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.920]   And so the text that we're looking at about the transition from the old covenant to the
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.600]   new covenant comes directly out of Jeremiah's text, in Jeremiah chapter 31, verse 31.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   And it is a direct quote from that passage that in the midst of the darkness, in the
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.240]   darkest period of Israel's history, God reminds them that he is not going to forsake them,
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.840]   that a new covenant is coming.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.160]   And that new covenant obviously is what he is referring to in Hebrews chapter 8.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.280]   So again, let me read it in verse 7 and 9.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.120]   With that perspective, coming out of Jeremiah 31, it says, "For if that first covenant had
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.560]   been faultless, there would have been no occasion sought for a second."
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.240]   And then this is the passage from Jeremiah.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.280]   "For finding fault with them, he said, 'Behold, days are coming,' says the Lord, 'when I will
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.160]   effect a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.'"
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.800]   Again, he's speaking to people who are obstinate against God.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.280]   In fact, the sin in Israel has gotten so bad that they were actually offering up their
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.320]   children as human sacrifice to the idol, Molech.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.280]   That's how bad it got.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.000]   And so in the midst of proclaiming judgment upon them, he breaks in with this prophecy
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.120]   that even in this darkness, God is bringing light.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.640]   "Not like the covenant which I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.200]   hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.960]   For they did not continue in my covenant, and I did not care for them, says the Lord."
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.040]   In other words, he says, "The covenant that I made with Moses, with the nation of Israel,
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.660]   was a conditional covenant, that if you obey my commandments, I will bless you.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.680]   And if you disobey my commandments, curse is going to be upon you."
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.900]   And so, the book of Jeremiah is the fulfillment of the covenant that God made with the nation
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.900]   of Israel.
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.800]   Because of their sin, judgment is coming.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.720]   But even in that midst, he says, "But a new covenant is coming, unlike the old covenant,
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.420]   where it's not going to depend on you.
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.920]   God is going to fulfill the covenant that he made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.120]   An unconditional covenant that he will not forsake his people."
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.940]   You know what's just interesting, the word for covenant in Hebrew, berith, literally
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.280]   means to cut.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.720]   So when you're reading the Old Testament and you read the word covenant, most of the time
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.160]   that Hebrew word behind that word is to cut.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.860]   And the reason why that word literally is cut is because of the way that they made covenants
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.960]   at that time, which is reflected in the way that we have weddings.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.720]   So if you know, I'm sure many of you have been to weddings, or most of you I'm assuming,
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.280]   and you have two aisles, or one aisle, and you have one party on one side and the other
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.240]   party on the other side, and then after the covenant is made, they would both hand in
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.000]   hand walk down that aisle.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.460]   Part of the reason why the Christian church does that is it reflects the way that they
[00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.440]   made covenants in the Old Testament.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.560]   We see that reflected in Genesis chapter 15, when God makes a covenant, he would cut the
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.100]   animals in two pieces.
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.440]   And then the two parties who are entering into this covenant would walk down this aisle
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.400]   with the animals who are bleeding on both sides, and the significance behind that is
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.400]   twofold.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:31.520]   One, if whoever breaks this covenant is going to be like these animals, that they will also
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.240]   be cut and they will also die.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.120]   In other words, that this covenant is to be taken seriously.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:42.320]   But the second meaning behind that covenant is that this covenant is ratified by the blood.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.880]   So the blood that is shed by the animals and the significance behind their death is what
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.840]   bound this covenant together.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.360]   And so what God is saying that in bringing this new covenant, and even by the by its
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:02.400]   very word pointed to the coming of Christ, that God was going to ratify this old covenant
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.120]   that they could not fulfill with a covenant that they cannot break because God is going
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:13.680]   to be faithful to himself, which is what he reiterates in Hebrews chapter 6.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:22.660]   And so the whole point of this text this morning is how and what is he doing in this new covenant.
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.520]   If I was to summarize, and again, you know, I'm not good at putting titles on sermons.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.960]   I usually just say what it is.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.400]   You know, if it was up to me, I would just say Hebrews 8, you know, verse 7 through 13.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.800]   That would be my title this morning.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.940]   And then you figure it out yourself.
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:42.360]   As I was reviewing the sermon after I gave the title, if I was to re-title the sermon,
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.560]   I would say religion versus relationship.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.520]   Religion versus relationship.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:53.520]   Because in a nutshell, that describes what he is saying here, the old covenant versus
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.240]   the new covenant.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.280]   And I know it is a cliche in the Christian community.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.280]   You know, it's not about religion.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.480]   It is about a relationship.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.920]   But it's a cliche for a reason.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.680]   Because there's truth behind it.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.840]   Religion is a bunch of set of rules that you follow.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:15.560]   A relationship is what we do because of the personal relationship that we have.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.760]   So that kind of summarizes, okay, in a nutshell.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.520]   So if you're going to fall asleep, at least remember the title, okay?
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.680]   Religion versus relationship.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.140]   The old covenant versus the new covenant, okay?
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.720]   My preference is that you don't fall asleep.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.000]   But if you do, at least remember the title, okay?
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.120]   There's three things that he says about this new covenant.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:42.280]   A renewed relationship with the law, a renewed relationship with God, and third, a renewed
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.520]   relationship with each other.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.960]   So that's basically how this text is divided.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:54.440]   First of all, the difference between the old and the new covenant is our relationship with
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.160]   the law.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.520]   In Hebrews chapter 810, it says, "I will put my laws into their minds, and I will write
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.200]   them on their hearts."
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:07.640]   And again, it's that same idea as repeated in Ezekiel chapter 36, verse 26.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.960]   "Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you, and I will remove
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:19.440]   the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh."
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.240]   Remember when the old covenant, the Mosaic covenant was written, where was that written?
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.480]   Do you remember?
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.720]   Plastic, metal, water, clouds?
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.120]   Stones.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:39.120]   God literally wrote the old covenant law on stones.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.280]   And then he says, in the new covenant, instead of writing it on the stone of your heart,
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:48.880]   he said, "I'm going to renew your flesh and your mind so that it would be embedded in
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:49.880]   you."
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:54.360]   Now, to better understand what's happening, the transition from the old and the new covenant
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:01.800]   in our relationship with the law, before Adam and Eve fell, we didn't have the Mosaic law
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.120]   to say, "You can't do this, and you ought to do this."
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.240]   It was written in their hearts.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.160]   It was written in their mind because God created them to be a reflection of his glory.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.160]   So innately, they understood.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:19.720]   They had a relationship with God and his standard and who he is, and it naturally reflected
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.760]   who he was or who he is.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:31.080]   But when they fell, that innate understanding of his glory and who he is began to get tainted.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:38.280]   So as time went by, God chooses to write his command, his laws, on stone because they were
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.400]   no longer able to recognize it in their hearts.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.020]   They were no longer innately in their mind.
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:48.040]   So the Mosaic law was not new law.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:53.280]   So much of the Mosaic law, if you read prior, you could see it reflected, whether it was
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.800]   sacrifices, whether it was a Sabbath.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:00.960]   Before it was written in stone, you could see that it was some of it, that they understood
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.960]   it.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:07.000]   But as time went by, God makes this covenant with them saying, "I'm going to show you what
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.120]   you don't understand innately anymore.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.080]   And I'm going to write this in stone.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:18.040]   So as ages go by and as you fall further and further away from understanding of who I am,
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.280]   you will be able to see the law and see what you have fallen short of."
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:29.940]   So now when Christ has come, he regenerates the Christians and he makes us new.
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.120]   And so when we have become new, what has he done?
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:36.560]   He has restored that innate ability to understand who God is.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.560]   Okay?
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.400]   Do you follow?
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:44.880]   And that's our relationship with the law, where we are able to understand who he is
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:50.280]   and his nature, because we lost it in our fall because of our sin, God places it externally
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:55.120]   so that people can see the standard in which we have fallen.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:00.640]   And then in the new covenant, because the Holy Spirit is indwelling in us, now that
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:07.800]   new law of who God is, his glory was written back into our hearts and into our minds.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.520]   But you and I do not know that perfectly because we are still living in this flesh.
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:18.080]   So the theologians call this here and not yet, meaning that we have been regenerated,
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.600]   but the final fulfillment of this relationship with the law is going to be up in heaven.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:27.760]   So when we're in heaven, there aren't going to be a set of rules to follow.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.080]   There isn't going to be another set of laws, like on Sunday you should do this and do not
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.520]   touch this and do not go here, because it says it's going to be in our hearts, it's
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.120]   going to be in our mind.
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:42.280]   We are going to be able to understand and know innately in our mind, in our heart.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.960]   And that's what he is saying.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:49.520]   He says in this covenant, you no longer, the set of rules is no longer about what you do
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.520]   externally.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.300]   It's not a bunch of check off stuff that you do and say, I did this.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.460]   And that's what a religion is, right?
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.040]   If I want to be a Christian, what do I need to do?
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:04.920]   And if somebody asks you that question, you may say, well, you got to find a good church.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.400]   Make a good translation of the Bible.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.400]   Become a member of that church.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.240]   Well, I'm a member of the church.
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.560]   Well, then learn how to serve.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.120]   So I'm serving.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.480]   Evangelize, make disciples.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.740]   And we can tell them all these external things to do.
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.640]   But again, if you've been studying the Bible for any period of time, you know you can do
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:30.420]   all of that and not be a Christian.
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.760]   Nobody has done that better than the Pharisees.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.480]   Well, you have to evangelize, you have to memorize scripture, you have to give, and
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.240]   you have to do this, you have to do that, you have to keep the Sabbath.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.600]   And nobody kept the law like the Jews, like the Pharisees.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.920]   And yet when Christ came, he says, this has nothing to do with me.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.920]   Because it is not about religion.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.440]   He says in the new covenant, it is not a set of rules that are external.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.400]   It is a regeneration of our heart.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.160]   In Romans chapter 7, he says the whole purpose of the law is so that we may understand and
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.920]   sin to be utterly sinful.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.440]   In other words, the law didn't make it utterly sinful.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:17.200]   The law revealed the utter sinfulness of our heart to show us how far we have fallen from
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.480]   his glory.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.160]   That was the purpose of the law.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:26.400]   But now in the new covenant, what the law could not do, God did by sending his son in
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.400]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.560]   Romans 8, 3.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.920]   For what the law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God did by sending
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.040]   his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.760]   And as an offering for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:43.420]   That's why it says in 2 Corinthians 5, 17, to describe a Christian, therefore if anyone
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.600]   is in Christ, he is a new creature.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.760]   The old things have passed away, behold, the new things have come.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.480]   So when somebody asks, what is an identifying mark of a Christian?
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:59.640]   The first thing that this describes is our relationship with the law.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.880]   Is there an innate desire to reflect his glory?
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.280]   Some people think salvation is just not going to hell.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.440]   You go to church and do the right things and it's nothing more than superstition because
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.000]   it's not biblical.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.320]   You can do all of that and still go to hell.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.960]   And if you've read the Bible and have been paying attention to anything that the scripture
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.680]   says, you know that even before I say it.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.880]   You can be a member of the church, you can serve, you can give, you can go to short-term
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.840]   missions, you can teach.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:33.200]   And unless there is a regeneration of our heart where the Holy Spirit is indwelling
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:40.560]   in us, and unless there is a change in our relationship where what we do is not simply
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:46.480]   following the external rules that have been set before us, which was the old covenant,
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:51.000]   we're in a new covenant, the regeneration of our heart causes us to desire to worship
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.680]   him in spirit and in truth.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.480]   And that's what Jesus was saying in John chapter 4 to that Samaritan woman.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.800]   Is it this mountain or that mountain we ought to be worshiping?
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.000]   He says no.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.640]   What God is looking for are people who worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:10.400]   In other words, not just to follow the external rules, but is there a regeneration in our
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.440]   heart where God has written his laws in our heart and in our mind?
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:19.120]   So Adam Clark in his commentary on this text says this, "All their affections, passions,
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:24.480]   and appetites shall be purified and filled with holiness and love to God and man, so
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.640]   that they shall not willingly obey and feel that love is fulfilling the law.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:33.480]   Instead of being written on the tables of stone, they shall be written on the fleshly
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.680]   tables of their hearts."
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.480]   That's the difference between somebody who is just following rules.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.560]   And you know, there's a lot of people who are good at following rules.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.280]   I'm not one of them.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.280]   Right?
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.880]   But innately, I'm rebellious.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.120]   I know that about myself.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.240]   If there are rules, my first instinct is, why do I have to do that?
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.240]   Right?
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.240]   But some of you guys are not like that.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.880]   Some of you guys are A+ students.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.880]   Right?
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.320]   And you follow one rule, and the next question is, what other rule can I follow?
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.320]   Right?
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.040]   I don't understand you, but there's some people, a lot of people are like that, especially
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.840]   in the Asian community.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.600]   Right?
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.560]   What he's saying is not talking about people who are good at following rules.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:22.280]   He's talking about worship that's coming because we have innately changed inwardly.
[00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.920]   The Holy Spirit came inside of us.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:30.920]   And maybe some of you, you don't remember a particular day that may have happened.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.320]   To me, it was just radical.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.160]   I got knocked over the head, and then I was different.
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.280]   And I know that more than not, many of you just grew up in the church and gradually began
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:44.400]   to understand the glory of God and your sins, and you can't pinpoint a certain day, but
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:51.120]   you can point to a certain period of your life where your affections changed.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.040]   Where it was no longer about obligation.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.780]   Maybe you did it because your parents made you do it.
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.600]   Maybe you did it because you just, I'm a Christian, I identify as a Christian, so that's what
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.640]   a Christian's supposed to do, and maybe you're just good at following rules.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:10.360]   But at some point, at some period, if it's not some particular day, you remember when
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:16.200]   there was a regeneration of your heart, where worshiping God was no longer an obligation,
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.200]   but joy.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:24.000]   Where obedience to Him was not necessarily a sacrifice, but the very thing that I desire
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.320]   to do.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:31.520]   We come to Christ, and the world won't understand why are you doing what you are doing.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.840]   The world doesn't understand because they don't know the joy that it produces.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.720]   They don't know that this is where we find life.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.960]   And that's what he's saying.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:44.000]   In the new covenant, there is a new relationship with the law where it is embedded in us through
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.880]   the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:51.280]   And we are attracted to the Spirit of God more than anything else in this world.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.760]   So without that Spirit, the Word of God makes no sense.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:04.000]   Read certain parts of the Scripture, like 1 Peter, where it tells us to suffer for good.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.200]   You know when you're suffering for good, you know what we call that in this world?
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.200]   Injustice.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:13.320]   And we have a whole world right now crying out, "Injustice, injustice."
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.880]   But 1 Peter tells us to endure injustice.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.660]   This world does not understand that.
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:23.000]   Because injustice means that needs to be corrected.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.400]   No one is going to sit under that.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.360]   And yet, in the non-Christian perspective, that makes absolutely no sense.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:36.220]   Yet in eternal perspective, he says, because it brings greater glory, greater light.
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.000]   So a non-Christian would never understand that.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.960]   As somebody who does not have the Holy Spirit, somebody who doesn't recognize the eternal
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.880]   hope that we have in Christ, will never understand that.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.580]   And that's what he's saying.
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:48.660]   It's not about religion.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:52.240]   If you are following religion, here's a bunch of rules that you're supposed to do.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.000]   Here's a bunch of things to make things right.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.440]   But there's a lot of things in the Scripture that we are called to do in the eyes of the
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.840]   world is absolutely wrong.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:07.080]   And we are called to do that in order to bring the greatest glory to God.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:11.280]   That's the first thing that he says that happens when the new covenant, when the Holy Spirit
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.280]   comes.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.680]   The second thing is our relationship with God is renewed.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:21.120]   Hebrews chapter 8, verse 10, "And I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.920]   Now we may look at that and say, "Well, I mean, he uses that on the nation of Israel
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.840]   in the old covenant.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.400]   He called them the apple of his eye.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.440]   What is different?"
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.560]   Let me illustrate this and what he means by here.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:38.280]   He's not just simply talking about a legal definition, a description of the people of
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.400]   Israel.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.120]   This is much more possessive.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.120]   Let me give you an explanation.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.840]   You know, some of you guys know my wife, people who've been at our church for a long period
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.520]   of time call her Mama Esther.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.040]   And some of you guys are like, "That's weird.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.320]   There's a cult.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.320]   Why is she Mama Esther?
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.040]   And why am I not Papa Peter?"
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.040]   Right?
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.120]   Well, there's a reason behind that because a long time ago, I mean, 15, 20 years ago,
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:06.600]   it's been a while, when our church was much smaller, I think we had about maybe 50, 50,
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.040]   60 people, we had a lot of Esthers.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:13.360]   You know, Esther Kim is a very common name in the Korean community.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.600]   So we had two Esther Kims and then two other Esthers.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:22.640]   So in order to distinguish the Esthers, we had one Esther we called Ezlo.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.800]   And the reason why we call her Ezlo, I will not get into.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.040]   Some of you guys who've been here for a while, you know why we call her Ezlo.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:33.320]   And then we had another lady in our church, her name was Esther Song, so we called her
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.320]   E Song.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:39.200]   And then we had another Esther, her name was Esther Beck, so we called her E Beck.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.660]   And then Esther will happen to be the oldest among them, and so they called her Mama Esther.
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.840]   So today, a lot of people don't know where this came from, and we have people much older
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.480]   than her calling her Mama Esther.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.280]   So people from the outside is like, "It may seem weird, but that's the history behind
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.880]   that," right?
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.880]   I remember in the beginning of that, before we had all these, you know, ways to differentiate
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.200]   them, people would, I would say Esther, and I'd have to re-explain.
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.120]   "Oh, I don't mean Esther Song.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.120]   I don't mean Esther Beck.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.120]   I don't mean the Esther, Esther Kim."
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.400]   In fact, I used to get into a lot of trouble because I used to send emails to Esther Kim.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.520]   Sometimes they were very personal emails.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:21.560]   And then the other Esther Kim, Ezlo, would get it and said, "Okay, thank you."
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.640]   And then I'd look at the names, "Oh, shoot, I messed up."
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.920]   So I have to double check, right?
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.440]   And I have to change their name.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:32.340]   But by that time, in order for me to differentiate between that, my Esther and other Esthers,
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.080]   I would have to say, "My Esther."
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:40.400]   And everybody knew when I said, "My Esther," that I was not referring to Esong or Ezlo
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.400]   or E Beck.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.480]   We're talking about Esther that I have a covenant relationship with.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.900]   I personally possess her.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.880]   She's my Esther.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:55.520]   That's what distinguishes her between any other Esther in the universe.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.080]   That's my Esther.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.540]   And I'm her Peter, all right?
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.400]   So that's what I mean when I say, "My Esther."
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:09.120]   And the reason why I say all of this is when he says that I will be their God and they
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:15.200]   shall be my people, he's not simply identifying them legally.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.200]   He's possessing them.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:21.800]   And in this new covenant, there is going to be this intimate relationship that they didn't
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.800]   have before.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:29.000]   And again, Ezekiel 37, 26, "I will make a new covenant of peace."
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.320]   See, the old covenant was called the covenant of the law.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.000]   The new covenant is called the covenant of peace.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.640]   The covenant of peace, not because that there's no turmoil, no trouble in your life if you
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:47.720]   enter into this covenant, he's talking about a peace between sinner and a holy God.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.040]   And that barrier between us and God is going to be taken away.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:57.000]   And so therefore, this new covenant that you and I are in is called the covenant of peace.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.440]   It will be an everlasting covenant.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.920]   There is no other covenant coming.
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.360]   This is the covenant that he was leading us to.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:10.640]   And I will place them and multiply them and I will set my sanctuary in their midst forever.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.100]   So in other words, there is a personal possession.
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:20.220]   So the first characteristic of this new covenant is a new relationship with the law.
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.240]   But the second is a new relationship with this God.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.780]   This is possessive.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:28.040]   There are many people who come to church for years and years and years and years, have
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.120]   an impersonal relationship with God.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.120]   He's a being.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.440]   He is an it.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.020]   He's a force.
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.020]   You can call him God.
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.020]   You can call him holy.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:39.360]   You can call him Jesus.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.000]   But it is not personal.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.360]   And that is a distinguishing mark between somebody who met Christ and fell in love with
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.120]   him versus somebody who worships him from a distance.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.120]   We just kind of observe.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.800]   And he's just a figure of God.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.880]   He's just a great person to worship.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.960]   But it's not personal.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.840]   Let me make my point here.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:08.760]   If I say to you, "Mom is so fat."
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.760]   Nobody flinches.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.480]   Because I'm just talking about mom.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.480]   You don't have any personal connection.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.960]   That could be anybody.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.000]   "Mom is so fat."
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.400]   Okay, I'm not going to finish that.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:25.240]   But if I said, "Yo mama."
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.120]   And I actually pointed finger.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.360]   "Yo mama is so fat."
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.400]   And I finished that sentence.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.840]   And I'm sure you would take that a lot more personally.
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:39.440]   And you take that personally because the mom that I'm talking about is your mom who loved
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.140]   you, raised you, endured with you.
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.520]   And there's a personal affection for that mom.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.060]   And so you care about your mom.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.840]   You care about her name being dragged through the mud.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.760]   You take it personally.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:28:00.880]   See, so many Christians who come to church has no personal affection for this God that
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.800]   they worship.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:08.920]   And so when his name is being blasphemed, you hear it like you're hearing something
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.320]   that is detached from you.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.660]   Hearing news of somebody who died that you don't know.
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.040]   There's no personal affection.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:24.240]   See, he says in the new covenant that not only are we his, but he is mine.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.240]   That's my God.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.680]   He's not a God.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.680]   He's not the God.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.680]   He's my God.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.520]   He didn't just die for the world.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.520]   He died for me.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.640]   He didn't just forgive the world.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.960]   He forgave me.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.640]   He's not just a refuge for the world.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.800]   He's my refuge.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.760]   He's my hope.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:44.280]   And that's what initiates us from wanting to come to him.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:53.000]   Part of the reason why so few Christians pray is because God is impersonal.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.920]   It's like going to a job interview to get things done.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:02.300]   To say that you went, you dressed up properly, and you said the right things.
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.420]   But it's not personal.
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:08.120]   The way we go to a job interview, the way we go to meet a close friend is very different.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.520]   One is something that you look forward to.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.860]   The other thing is just something that you have to get over with.
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:16.520]   And at the core of that is because of our relationship with God.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.720]   He said in the covenant, he renews that.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:24.720]   See, the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian in 2 Corinthians 4, 3-4 is
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:31.800]   that non-Christians are blinded by the enemy, by the God of this age, so that we do not
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.680]   see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.980]   That's a non-Christian.
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:37.980]   They can learn about God.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.100]   They can study about God.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.240]   They can even talk about God.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.920]   They can even evangelize about God.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.560]   But the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian is that a Christian has opened
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.380]   his eyes to see his glory.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.420]   And you know what it means to see his glory?
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:55.440]   You've seen his essence.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:01.560]   You cannot see his glory and not fall in love.
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.360]   Because that's who he is.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.920]   You cannot.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.540]   You know, you can go and eat a sandwich and say, "I like it or I don't like it."
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:14.120]   You can go take a vacation and say, "I like this area, I don't like this area."
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:20.400]   But when our eyes become open to the glory of God, when our eyes get open to the glory
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:24.880]   of God, we fall in love.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.840]   You know why?
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:33.320]   Because every human being was created for that purpose.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:37.440]   Every human being was created in the image of God.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:42.860]   So when our eyes become open to see that image, we recognize that this is what we've been
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:45.940]   created for.
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:49.300]   We are restored back to what he intended.
[00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.120]   And it fits.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.760]   So we end up being attracted to him.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:59.000]   That's why in Acts chapter 9, 18-19, Apostle Paul lived all his life in religion and obeying
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.760]   the laws of Pharisee among Pharisees.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:05.560]   He said, "As to the law," he says, "he was perfect."
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.840]   But yet when he met Christ, what does he say?
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:13.640]   In light of the surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ, all of that became rubbish.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.640]   All of these external things that he was checking off.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.280]   He said he was better than everybody else and he wasn't exaggerating.
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.040]   I mean, he was a Pharisee among Pharisees.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.360]   "As to the law," he says, "he was perfect."
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:30.080]   And yet in comparison to the new covenant relationship with Christ, all of that was
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.080]   rubbish.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:35.000]   Remember what happens?
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.840]   He meets Christ in his glory.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.840]   He falls blind for three days.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:44.120]   And after three days, what happens in Acts chapter 9, 18 or 19?
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.560]   He says after three days, the scale falls off of his eyes.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.560]   Right?
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:54.460]   Now, I'm not an optometrist, but most people don't walk around with scales in their eyes.
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.840]   What did this mean?
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.720]   What blinded him was taken away.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.600]   It symbolized his blindness.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:11.060]   Then after seeing the glory of Christ, all of a sudden he was seeing for the first time.
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.960]   And from that moment on, he became an evangelist.
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.960]   He didn't go to seminary.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.480]   He didn't get training.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.520]   He was just telling people about what he fell in love with.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.920]   And all of a sudden, he began to love whatever he loved.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:28.120]   Because that's what happens when you fall in love.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:32.480]   When you fall in love, you know, I hated noodles before I met Esther.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:38.880]   I'm not going to say I love noodles, but I like noodles.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.000]   You end up liking what the other person likes.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.360]   You end up doing what that other person does when you fall in love.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.960]   And that's what happened to Apostle Paul.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:53.620]   Scales came off of his eyes, and all of a sudden, Christ's mission was his mission.
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:57.200]   He hated the Gentiles, and all of a sudden, he became the apostle of the Gentiles, and
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.840]   he fell in love.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:32:59.840]   That's what happened.
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:05.080]   That's why in 2 Corinthians 3, 14-18, it says, "But their minds were hardened, for until
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:10.120]   this very day at the reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains unlifted, because it
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.400]   is removed in Christ."
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.880]   In other words, all they see is a religion.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.300]   All they see is a set of things that they're supposed to do and not do.
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.880]   But they do not see, because they did not see Christ.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.800]   To this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their heart, but whenever a person
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.440]   turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.200]   Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:36.640]   But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:40.760]   being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.400]   Spirit.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:48.240]   You notice here, if you pay attention, he's describing sanctification.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:54.920]   In the way that we do discipleship, if we get somebody who's not disciplined to be disciplined,
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.740]   they're better disciples.
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:00.160]   If somebody's not memorizing scripture and they're memorizing scripture, they're being
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.520]   sanctified.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.640]   If you're not doing what you're supposed to do, and you get them to do what they're supposed
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.760]   to do, they're better disciples.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:10.260]   That's not how the Bible describes sanctification.
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:16.000]   The sanctification he describes is a greater exposure to his glory.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:23.360]   More and more of seeing who he is, we are being transformed as we are seeing his glory.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:29.480]   So when we see his glory, it causes us to love the Word.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.520]   It causes us to spread the gospel.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.340]   It causes us to do all these things.
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:39.060]   But it happens because internally we are changing as we are seeing his glory.
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.360]   That's how sanctification is described.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.840]   So justification happens when the scales fall off.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:48.880]   Sanctification happens as we see more and more of that glory.
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:55.040]   So you can have an individual who is very disciplined, who's memorizing scripture, and
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:02.760]   is very good at rule keeping, and be no closer to God than when he first started.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.080]   Because there is no transformation.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.240]   There is no affection for God growing in that person.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:11.040]   So he says the difference between the old covenant and the new covenant is not only
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:15.560]   a relationship with the law, but relationship with this God.
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:20.580]   He renews a renewed affection, which is the catalyst behind what we do.
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:27.200]   So there's a world of difference between somebody who is regurgitating information about Christ
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.960]   to other people.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.640]   You went to seminary, and I know this deep theology.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.720]   I read a book.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.440]   I was told this, so now I'm going to tell you the knowledge that I have.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:38.160]   I'm going to give it to you.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.960]   There's a world of difference between somebody who is sharing because he heard it and then
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:47.000]   he's regurgitating it versus somebody who witnessed Christ.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.920]   He saw his glory, and he's just telling you what he loves.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.280]   Evangelism is night and day.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:00.560]   When you talk to somebody who's just selling you a product versus somebody who wants you
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:07.320]   to have this because he believes that it just hasn't affected me, it will affect you.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:13.240]   So the catalyst behind sanctification is a growing, growing relationship with Jesus
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.240]   Christ.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:19.340]   Third and finally, a renewed relationship with each other.
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:24.420]   Right now, again, we live in a world where we're all like, "We need to get this right.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.080]   We need to get this relationship right.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.340]   We need to get rid of racism.
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:30.120]   We need to get rid of prejudice."
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.900]   All of that is true.
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:38.560]   But the scripture clearly says, "Until there is restoration and peace with God, there is
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.820]   no peace with man."
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:48.840]   The injustice and racism that people are so concerned about is a result of the fall of
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.840]   mankind.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:56.200]   It is not simply because of certain rules and regulations that we need to change.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:01.040]   Again, if there are certain things that we need to change, we should change.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:07.280]   But overall, the scripture tells us, "Peace with man does not and cannot happen until
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.360]   there is peace with God."
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:15.420]   See in Hebrews 8, 11, it says, "And they shall not teach everyone, his fellow citizen,
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:19.600]   and everyone his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord, for all will know me, and from the least
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.880]   to the greatest to them.'"
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:21.880]   Now what does he mean by that?
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.560]   No one's going to teach each other.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:24.960]   I'm teaching you now.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.960]   Maybe I'm breaking the commandment.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:29.320]   This is not part of the commandment.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:34.960]   In fact, Hebrews 5, 12, the very author says, "You ought to be teachers by now."
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.960]   He says that.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.960]   So is he contradicting himself?
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:43.160]   In Ephesians 4, 11-12, the pastors that you guys studied not too long ago, he says, "He
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:49.240]   established apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers to equip so that we
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:53.400]   may have unity of the knowledge of God."
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:59.080]   James 3, 1, "Not many of you should be teachers," meaning some need to be teachers.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:03.840]   So what does he mean here when he says, "You shall not, they shall not teach everyone,
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:08.880]   his fellow citizen, and everyone his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord.'"
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:13.440]   What he means here is not saying that there's no need for anybody to teach anything because
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:17.240]   now since the law is written in our hearts and our mind, everybody knows what to do and
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.200]   we're just going to do it.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.760]   When we get to heaven, that is true.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:26.520]   While we are here, the here and not yet, he's established teachers, apostles.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:31.560]   In fact, he has regulations on when we establish teachers, what are the qualifications that
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.560]   make them teachers.
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:37.440]   In fact, an elder needs to be able to teach.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:44.240]   What he means here is that we no longer have additional things, additional people to get
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.240]   to to get to God.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:52.560]   Remember, this is being stated in the context of the old tabernacle versus the new covenant.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:59.440]   In the old tabernacle, there was a clear hierarchy of how they can reach God.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:04.280]   The high priest, one person, he has the most intimate access to God.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.840]   He can go to the Holy of Holies only once a year.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:12.140]   The priest can go to the Holies, the outer chamber, and they can make sacrifices and
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:14.920]   sprinkle the blood, but they could be around the chamber.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:19.320]   If you were a Jewish male, you can come to the outer court and offer the sacrifices and
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:23.480]   hang around, but if you were a Jewish female, there are certain parts of the tabernacle
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.920]   that you couldn't go to.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:29.960]   If you happen to be a Gentile convert, there are certain places that you couldn't go to.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:35.440]   If you had any kind of defect, if you were a eunuch, or if you had any kind of pores
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.320]   that were open, you were not allowed.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:43.020]   There was a strict hierarchy of who had access and who you needed to go to in order for you
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.120]   to have access to God.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:48.780]   He's saying in the new covenant, all of that is broken.
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:55.640]   There is no other mediator between us and God other than Christ Jesus, and every single
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:59.280]   Christian has equal access.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:05.100]   I don't have more access than you do, and you don't have more access than I do.
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:09.040]   Just because you get a title or I went to seminary, somehow there's some inner chamber
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.760]   doors that opened up for me.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.360]   We have equal access.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:22.040]   Meaning, every single one of us, everything that we need for a life of godliness, you
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.300]   have.
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:28.620]   Some of the biggest hindrances in our Christian life is when we begin to convince ourselves,
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:32.000]   I am the way I am because.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.040]   I am the way I am because of my upbringing.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.840]   I am the way I am because I wasn't discipled.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:39.280]   I am the way I am because I don't have enough older people in my life.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.280]   I am the way I am because we lack this program.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.720]   I can't do this because of that.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:51.080]   Once we begin to tell ourselves that I lack these things to access God, from that moment,
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.200]   I have an excuse.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.080]   I don't need to go to God because it wasn't me.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.880]   God didn't provide the things that I need.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:02.480]   And yet, in 2 Peter 1, 2-3, it says, "Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:08.460]   of God and of Jesus Christ our Lord, seeing that his divine power has granted to us everything
[00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:12.040]   pertaining to life and godliness."
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.620]   I want you to stop right there and just let that sink in.
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:21.320]   Everything that you need for life and godliness has been given to you.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:27.680]   Think about how often we think, "If I had this, if I had a better small group, if I
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:33.960]   had better pastors, if I had a better community, if I had older people in my life, if I had
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:39.480]   a better job, if my kids were more obedient, if I had a little bit more money, if I had
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:44.240]   a better job, if I had better vacation, if I lived in a better neighborhood, if I had
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.600]   better this and better that."
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:50.680]   And once that thought enters our mind, from that moment on, I am the way I am because
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.320]   of the circumstance that I'm in.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:57.880]   And yet, the scripture says, "No, the access has been opened to you."
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:03.560]   Everything that you need for life of godliness, you already have.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.680]   You know what that means?
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:08.400]   You know what that means?
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.400]   Every single one of us.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:13.200]   The gathering of people are people who have equal access to God.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:17.980]   You don't need to come to church simply to meet God.
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:24.160]   Church is a place where we come to celebrate what we have in Christ.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:28.120]   Church is a gathering of people that have been regenerated, who have fallen in love
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:31.600]   with what we have in Christ, to worship together.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:36.640]   I mean, that's what makes church beautiful.
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:43.160]   Because it's not about the educated, it's not about what race, it's not about our background.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:48.760]   Every single person, no matter how difficult your life, no matter how sick you are, no
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:53.280]   matter how much time you have or how little time you have, every single one of us has
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:57.600]   access to the holy of holies because of what Christ has done.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.920]   And that's what affects our relationship with each other.
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.600]   Because I don't need you.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.880]   I don't find life in you.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.580]   I don't find refuge in you.
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:12.360]   My hope is not in you.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.280]   It's in Christ.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:24.040]   So because I am satisfied in Christ, when I come to church, the overflowing joy in me
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:27.640]   can be shared with other people.
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:28.720]   That's what the church is meant to be.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.120]   But you have a church filled with people who are frustrated because I don't have this,
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:34.360]   I don't have that, and then they come to church, how come he's not giving me, nobody's reaching
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:38.680]   out to me, nobody cares about me, because we're trying to find satisfaction in each
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:43.080]   other that was meant to be fulfilled in Christ.
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:48.600]   See, that's what affects fellowship.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:58.440]   So even when we feel injustice, we can't squash our joy.
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.960]   Because my joy is not found in justice.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:08.320]   My life is not found in making sure that I get what's mine.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:12.700]   It's like winning the lottery, you know, and you got a billion dollar, the greatest lottery
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:17.320]   in history, and then you're complaining about the parking ticket that you got.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:21.920]   Now I got to go pay this, this is so unfair.
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:27.560]   And instead of celebrating the lottery that you won, a billion dollars that you didn't
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:35.280]   deserve, you spend all your time complaining about that ticket that was unjust, you know.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.240]   That's not, that's not right.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.240]   That can't be right.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:39.520]   How can they be doing this to me?
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.760]   Why are they doing this?
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:45.200]   I got to go to the parking, I got to go over there, wake up early and pay this ticket.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:49.080]   You know, it's a $50 ticket and it's nothing to you compared to what you already have in
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.080]   Christ.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:59.000]   That's why the greatest hindrance to true worship is a grumbling heart.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.560]   Not recognizing what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:08.840]   But imagine a community of people who recognizes what they have in Christ.
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.520]   I don't deserve mercy.
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.560]   I don't deserve love.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.540]   And yet he gave it to me.
[00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:19.840]   And so because he loved me, I can love you.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.220]   Not because I know you're going to, you're going to be fair to me.
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.040]   Not because you're going to love me back.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.660]   Because my love is not based upon your love for me.
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:31.220]   My love is based upon his love for me.
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:36.340]   And that's how God restores peace in mankind.
[00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:43.980]   You fill a room or a society or a country filled with people who want fairness.
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:49.940]   Again, perfectly understandable in the secular world.
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:54.580]   But as Christians, we're all lottery winners.
[00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:57.940]   So we're able to be generous.
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:59.540]   We're able to give.
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:01.900]   We're able to be gracious.
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:05.660]   So peace with God is what causes the peace with man.
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:09.260]   So let me conclude with this.
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:12.340]   Is Christ enough in this new covenant?
[00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:15.980]   If you were poor and you had Jesus, I'm talking about real poverty, right?
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:20.180]   I'm not talking about not being able to drink boba whenever you want, right?
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.700]   I'm talking about real poverty.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.060]   Like you, you can't afford an apartment.
[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:25.060]   You can't buy a car.
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:30.940]   Like if you were poor and you had Jesus, would that be enough?
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:38.740]   If you caught COVID or somebody you love caught COVID and they died, but you had Christ and
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:45.340]   they had Christ, is that enough?
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:53.860]   Would you be okay if you were imprisoned falsely and had to spend the rest of your life in
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:56.920]   prison for something that you did not do?
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.180]   And yet you had Christ.
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:04.340]   Is that enough?
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:10.580]   Every single one of us has been given something that you and I could not possibly earn.
[00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:17.620]   So even if I become sick and homeless and die early, for the rest of eternity, God deserves
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:19.900]   my praise.
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:24.580]   The character of believers should be different than the world.
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.660]   And this is why we're going to sing.
[00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:30.060]   In fact, let me ask the praise team to come back up.
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:31.060]   Where are you?
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.260]   Yeah, if you guys can come back, come back up.
[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:37.260]   We're going to sing this song, "All I Have is Christ."
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:41.660]   You know, the song, "All I Have is Christ," is hard to sing sometimes when you're rich.
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:43.460]   Yes, we're rich.
[00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.980]   Every single one of us, because we live in Orange County.
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:46.980]   You have your bills paid.
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:48.020]   You know what I mean?
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:53.220]   No one is going to leave this room and saying, "I don't have $7 to go get a hamburger."
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.420]   And if you do, we'll give it to you.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.340]   We have enough, right?
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:02.860]   But sometimes because we're rich, to say, "All I have is Christ," because it's not true.
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:04.100]   We have Christ.
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.060]   We have a good job, good relationship.
[00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:09.580]   We're sitting in an air-conditioned room, living in a free country, right?
[00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:12.980]   We don't have people breaking down doors and trying to arrest us.
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:19.540]   You know, our persecution, at least now, our persecution is people not liking us, right?
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:24.100]   So sometimes it's rich people to say, "All I have is Christ," it's just not relatable.
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:29.860]   You know, when we sing this song, "All I Have is Christ," I think we need to be reminded,
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:32.700]   "All I need is Christ."
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:38.780]   So in our distraction, in all the blessings that God has given us, as we sing this song,
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:39.780]   let's make this our prayer.
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.180]   "All I need is Christ."
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:44.580]   So let me pray for us, and then we'll let our worship team lead us.
[00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:49.460]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much, Father, for the new covenant that you've given us.
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.500]   This covenant of peace.
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:57.100]   Help us, Lord God, if we have drifted in any way and have forgotten what it is that we
[00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.020]   have in you.
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:03.980]   Help us to be reminded, even as we sing this song, that all we have is Christ, all we need
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:04.980]   is Christ.
[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:10.460]   And may that be our cry, may that be our worship, may that be the source of our joy.
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:12.340]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
