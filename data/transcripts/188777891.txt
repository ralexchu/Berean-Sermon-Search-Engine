[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.560]   If you can turn your Bibles to Romans chapter 8 verses 5 through 11, Romans chapter 8 verses 5
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.080]   through 11, we're going to be continuing on the subject of the Holy Spirit and the law and the
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:24.480]   flesh. Again, all of these messages really needs to be understood all together because it is
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.440]   connected. Paul is making an argument, obviously all the whole book of Romans is written like that,
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.280]   but in particular chapter 6, 7, and 8, because if you just come in in the middle, some of the stuff
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.240]   may not make a whole lot of sense. Not that you're not going to be able to understand it, but really
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.080]   you need to kind of get the mindset of what he said and then what he's going to say. So again,
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.600]   just to give you a heads up that what we're talking about in the Holy Spirit today, it is
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.440]   not comprehensive. It is a part of what he says in the larger picture. So I'm sure a lot of questions
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.800]   may come up, but some of those things will be addressed in the later part of the book of Romans.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.120]   Romans chapter 8 verse 5 through 11, "For those who live according to the flesh set their minds
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.360]   in the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds in the
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.240]   things of the Spirit. For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.040]   is life and peace. For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.480]   to God's law. Indeed, it cannot, those who are in the flesh cannot please God. You, however, are not
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.160]   in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.520]   have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, although the body is
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.240]   dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.240]   Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:56.880]   your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you." Let's pray. Gracious Father, we pray that
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:07.080]   your Word would be your words, Lord God, and not mine, not man's, not our opinions, but the authority
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.040]   that you have placed. I pray, Father God, that your Word would go forth. Cause us to see clearly who
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.000]   you are, what it is that we have in Christ. That our understanding of the gift of the Spirit, our
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.920]   salvation, Christ crucified, all of these things, Lord God, that may be correctly understood. That
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.000]   our minds, our thoughts, and our worship may be thoroughly influenced, Lord God, by who you are.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.640]   We ask for your anointing over this time. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. As we've been talking about
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.080]   justification by faith, and again, chapter 6, where he says, "Well, if it's justification by faith, isn't
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.880]   that going to lead to licentiousness?" There is no consequence for sin. If that's the case, then we
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.600]   can just do whatever we want. And of course, that's not what God desires, but if that is what happens,
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.360]   so what? I mean, genuine Christians aren't gonna say, "So what?" But in reality, that may actually
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.520]   happen, right? There's no consequence. So Paul says, "That is not the case at all, by no means."
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.120]   That doesn't happen because when we were crucified with Christ, our old self died, and we were renewed
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.200]   in Christ, we were united with Him. We were married, we were freed from the marriage of the previous,
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.120]   with the law, and now we are married to Christ. We're no longer enslaved to the law of sin, but
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.200]   now we're enslaved to righteousness. So therefore, he says, that is not what happens to a Christian.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.240]   So it does not. A genuine justification by faith actually leads to genuine sanctification, genuine
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.880]   growth in his spiritual life. He says, "Then what is the purpose of the law?" Chapter 7. "It came in
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.880]   order to reveal sin, it came in order to stir up sin, and it came so that sin would become utterly
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:58.040]   sinful." To lead us to a point where Paul says in verse 24, chapter 7, "Woe is me! Oh, what a wretched
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.000]   man that I am! Who is going to deliver me from this body of sin?" And so he introduces Christ,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.440]   and through Christ and His blood sacrifice, how we become renewed. So what we could not do, what the
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.480]   law could not do, we can by the sinful flesh. God did by sending His only begotten Son. And so the
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.720]   distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian is the Holy Spirit. So we said that God initiates
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.480]   salvation, Jesus Christ mediates salvation, and the Holy Spirit is the one who perpetuates, gives us
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.920]   the power so that now not only are we saved, we are being saved by the Holy Spirit, and that we
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:41.080]   will be saved ultimately. And that is in a nutshell how the Bible describes our salvation. So the
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.680]   distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian is the Holy Spirit. A non-Christian can declare to
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:54.560]   know God. A non-Christian can even say that Jesus Christ came and He died. Remember even the demons
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.040]   when they saw Jesus they bowed to the ground and said, "Son of God, have you come before your time
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:06.520]   to torture us?" Satan knew exactly what Jesus was doing so he enters into Judas and tries to
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.960]   prevent him from going. And then he influences Peter trying to get him not to go. So Satan was
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.520]   very aware of what Jesus was going to do. So the demons were not unaware. So James says, "If you
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.440]   have faith without deeds, it's dead faith. It is no different than these demons who declare these
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.320]   things. They believe in a God but it doesn't produce works." So the distinction between a
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.200]   Christian and a non-Christian is the Holy Spirit. Holy Spirit that regenerates, Holy Spirit that
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:44.240]   indwells, and Holy Spirit that empowers us. That is not disputed. There is a dispute between, in
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.800]   chapter 7, is that a Christian or a non-Christian? Now again depending on which era of commentary
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.880]   that you read you're gonna get different views. That could be up to interpretation. But what I
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.320]   just said about the power of the Holy Spirit, about a Christian having indwelling of the Holy
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.480]   Spirit, that is not disputed no matter what denomination, no matter what era of Christianity
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:10.880]   that you may read. But there's a tension. There are things that sometimes we say in the church
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:18.160]   and then there's a disconnect in the way that we live. And so after a while when you continue to
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.840]   live your life and you see this disconnect, there's a disconnect from the Bible and your life. And that
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.000]   disconnect is pretty obvious. And I think that the greatest of this disconnect is, I know what the
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.040]   Bible says, but I don't see this in my life. Nor do I see it in the life of majority of the Christians.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:41.600]   I know some people, but majority of the Christians that I know, I don't see this. So because of this
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.800]   tension between here's what God says we ought to do, says who we are, and then what I'm experiencing,
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.160]   what I'm seeing, I would see it on television, people giving their lives. Every once in a while we see
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.040]   missionaries who are packing up their bags and doing crazy things for Christ. It's like, okay, I see it
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:05.120]   in them. But in our personal lives, that may not be the case. So different groups have come up with
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:11.600]   the solution to this. So the Pentecostals have said, maybe the reason why there's this disconnect,
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.640]   there's this gap between who we ought to be and who we are, is that we need a second baptism of the
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.640]   Holy Spirit. That you were baptized maybe when you became a Christian, or maybe you weren't baptized
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.560]   at all. And you really need to be baptized by the Holy Spirit. So there's two levels of Christians.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.200]   There's Christians who are not filled with the Holy Spirit, and then there's Christians who are
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:39.200]   filled with the Holy Spirit. Now, years ago we were out in Balboa, and we were out witnessing,
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.960]   sharing the Gospel with people. And I ran into a group of people who believed that, Apostolic
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:49.600]   Pentecostals. And they believed that the evidence that you have this baptism with the Holy Spirit,
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.760]   that you need to speak in tongues. So we were going back and forth, opening up the Scripture,
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.200]   and they had this whole chart in the back of their trunk, and they were showing me all of this stuff.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.560]   And then, you know, at the end, we said, "You know what? Let's just pray. Let's pray, because we're
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.800]   not getting anywhere." So I started praying with them, and it was surprising. As soon as I started
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:12.280]   praying, all of them, about 12, 13 of them who was out there, surrounded me. And all of a sudden,
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.360]   right in the middle of the Balboa, you know where the, what do you call it? The bridge.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:23.520]   Pier. Pier, yeah, the pier. Right in the beginning of that pier, they surrounded me, and all 12 of them
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:30.040]   just started speaking in tongues. You know? And so I was praying, and I remember after the prayer,
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.920]   I was just looking up at them, and they said, "Did you get it? Did you get the tongues?"
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.960]   I was like, "No." You know? But with them, the distinguishing mark between a Christian and
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.320]   non-Christian is, do you speak tongues? Because if you don't speak tongues, that means you don't have
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:48.280]   the Holy Spirit. We have variations of that, even though, again, completely unbiblical. I'm not
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.000]   gonna get into arguing all of this. Maybe one of these days, when we have a systematic theology
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.040]   class, that we can get into more details of why that's not biblical. But we have variations of
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:04.120]   this. Some people will say, "Well, maybe people are immature, because there is a lack of
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:09.120]   organization, lack of discipleship. You haven't met the right person, and you're not doing certain
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.480]   things right." And so, maybe that's what it is. Maybe if we applied the right methodology. Maybe
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:21.960]   if we were organized differently, and then we were more relevant. But the problem with that
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:27.000]   is, if you go to church, to church, to church, to church, using different methodology, and different
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:36.320]   organization, you'll see that this struggle is consistent over denominations, over different
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:45.000]   groups, over campus ministries, over ages. Recently, we had a resurgence of Reformed Theology. And,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.160]   again, getting us back to the Scripture, obviously, is a great thing. But it also led to this pseudo
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.880]   intellectualism. Thinking that if you have enough knowledge, and if you can quote enough things,
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.760]   and read enough books, that somehow that makes you mature. And so, that's how we're bridging the gap
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:10.200]   between a matured and non-mature person. This idea has taken even outside of the Christian circle,
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.280]   where people are so frustrated with this. Some of these cults say, "Maybe it's because you're at the
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:19.680]   wrong church, that you need to be baptized into the Church of Christ." So, that's the reason why
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.920]   you're not experiencing this abundant life, because you're at the wrong church. And so, you have to go
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.920]   to their church, and you have to be baptized. In fact, I spent almost a whole year with one of the
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:37.040]   leaders, or two of the guys, who are on campus at UCI. And the two guys who are there, the local
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.080]   church movement. You guys may or may not know, because they tend to change their name every once
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.800]   in a while. But basically, they were saying that, you know, there's two different groups of Christians.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.880]   There's a regular Christian, and then Kingdom Christian. Kingdom Christian are people who belong
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:59.280]   to their church. So, those are the people who are saved in body, soul, and spirit. So, the regular
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:04.320]   Christians are Christians who are only saved body and soul, but not spirit. So, we spent a long time
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:10.040]   arguing and discussing over this. And so, but the tension of what caused them to get there is the
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:16.480]   same. Because they see what they see in the church, and what they see in the Scripture, it doesn't
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:24.960]   match. So, where is the sanctification, and how do we bridge this gap? We need to make sure, again,
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:30.920]   first and foremost, as we studied on Thursday, that whatever it is that we think to be true or
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:37.880]   false, doesn't come from my worldview, or what I think is right, or what makes the most sense to me.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:44.000]   We have to make sure that it is coming from a careful study of the Word of God. Where does my
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.640]   thought come from? Where does my convictions come from? Obviously, it's clear we need to come to the
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:55.960]   Word of God. The difference between a Christian and a non-Christian, clearly, is the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:03.160]   What the law could not do, God did by sending His Son, who walked in the Spirit, not according to
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:11.760]   the flesh. So, the two extreme ways to apply this, if the Holy Spirit is the answer, how do we apply
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.280]   this? So, you have one extreme where it says, "Just let go and let God." Since it's not me and the Holy
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:21.400]   Spirit, it kind of makes us a passive recipient, and we just kind of sit there, and then, "Well, the
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:26.440]   Holy Spirit's not doing anything, so what can I do?" That's not what the Bible teaches. In fact,
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:31.640]   there's imperative in the Scripture, "Be filled with the Spirit." Walk in the Spirit, right? To,
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:37.440]   all things to be done in the Spirit. So, these are imperatives, or things that we are taught to do.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:43.720]   Do not grieve the Spirit. The other extreme is to think that, "Well, if it's the Holy Spirit, so
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:49.400]   somehow I can wield the Holy Spirit. That if I maybe just did certain things, quoted the certain
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.560]   verses, or prayed a certain way, that I can capture the power of the Holy Spirit and wield it toward
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:01.400]   a certain direction." Now, we see that mistake in Acts chapter 8, 17 to 20. If you remember a man
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.720]   named Simon, when he sees Peter praying for people, and the Holy Spirit comes upon them, remember what
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.640]   he does? He says, "Well, I have money. How much is it going to cost? How much can I give you, and can
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:16.040]   you give me this power?" And as a result of that, Peter gets angry, and he says, "Not only will you
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.480]   not receive this power, you're going to be judged for thinking that you're able to purchase this."
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:28.120]   And then another example we see in Acts chapter 19, the sons of Sceva, where Paul is going around,
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.840]   and he's doing tremendous amount of miracles. And so, he thinks that maybe he could also cast out
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:40.400]   demons. And then, so the sons of Sceva, these seven sons of Sceva, get in a room with this demon
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:46.520]   possessed man, and tries to cast out the demon. Remember what the demon says? "I know Paul, and I
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:55.320]   know Jesus, but who are you?" And then what happens, he says, "They overcome this man, and they strip him
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:02.320]   naked, and they run out screaming, wounded." So, what is the point of that? You can't wield the Holy
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:08.520]   Spirit. It was in their arrogance to think, "Maybe if we did this, oh, they can do it. Maybe I can do it."
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.720]   And as a result of that, they get overcome, and they get thoroughly humiliated. The Holy Spirit is
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:19.160]   not something for us to wield. No different than God Himself, for us to think that somehow,
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:27.000]   if we say the right magic words, God has to bend to our prayers. Which, again, a whole group of,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.720]   there was a whole movement called the Word-Faith Movement that actually taught that. Then, if that's
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.560]   not the case, if we can't wield His power, if we're not to be passive, and just passive recipients,
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:42.360]   how do we engage this Holy Spirit? What does this power of the Holy Spirit look like in the life of
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:47.320]   a Christian? Some of you, I know, were probably wrestling with that and thinking, "Ok, now He's
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.760]   going to give us the answer, and we're going to fix this problem once and for all." Right? If that was
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.560]   the case, that would have happened a long time ago. Right? But I want to show you what the
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:05.280]   Scripture says. But first and foremost, we have to understand when we think of power, that that power
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:14.400]   that we're expecting and hoping for is the power described in the Bible. Not what you and I oftentimes
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:21.680]   equate with power. Because, again, in 2 Corinthians 12, 9, Jesus deliberately humbles Paul. And Paul
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:27.600]   says at the end of his struggle that, "When I am weak, He is powerful. He is strong." So He deliberately
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:33.560]   makes us weak in order to demonstrate His power. But I want to give you, I think, the most tangible,
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:41.240]   tangible evidence, or tangible demonstration of what God deems to be powerful. Turn your Bibles
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:50.440]   with me to 1 Kings chapter 19, 9-18. Elijah is a prophet during a period of probably one of the
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:58.960]   worst kings of Israel, Ahab. And his wife was even worse, Jezebel. There's an encounter that Elijah
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:06.720]   has with the idol worshippers, these priests. And over 400 of them encounter him. And they say, "Well,
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:12.560]   if it's your God or my God, let's see what happens." And God comes and consumes them with fire and they
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:22.440]   die. So you would think at the end a revival would break out. Nothing of the sort. After that event,
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:28.200]   when Jezebel hears from Ahab, Ahab comes running to his wife and tells his wife exactly what
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:33.240]   happened. Elijah, this troublemaker, he killed all our prophets. And then Jezebel's determined,
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:39.600]   "I'm gonna get this guy. We're gonna make sure he dies." She's just determined. She's not afraid of
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:46.520]   him at all. And then it's strange that Elijah, after seeing that kind of power from God, gets
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:53.480]   so discouraged, he runs off and hides into a cave. That's the setup. He's in a cave right now. He ran
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:59.040]   away because Jezebel said, "I'm gonna kill him." Right? Verse 9, "There he came to a cave and lodged
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:04.320]   in it. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him. And he said to him, 'What are you doing here,
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:10.320]   Elijah?'" Right? "And he said, 'I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts. For the
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:15.240]   people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:21.680]   with the sword. And I, even I, only am left, and they seek my life to take it away.'" You see the
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:28.320]   discouragement of Elijah was he expected a revival to break out. But instead of revival, they're
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:32.680]   determined to get him. And Jezebel and Ahab said, "We're gonna kill this guy." So he said, "I've done
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:38.120]   everything I could possibly do, but it's just not working. Not only is it not working, I'm the only
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:45.000]   prophet left. And I'm done. I don't know if I can keep doing this." So he's burnt out. He just saw
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.600]   the greatest power of God, and now he's hiding in a cave. Just a few days later, he's hiding
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.920]   in a cave. He said, "I'm burnt out. I'm tired. Lord, I don't want to do this anymore." And then he said,
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:03.800]   "Go out and stand on the mount before the Lord, and I will pass by." And behold, the Lord passes
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:10.080]   by. So he said, "I'm gonna show you. You're burnt out, and you need to have a fresh encounter with
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:18.560]   me." And so God says, "Go out and wait for me, and God's gonna pass by." And he says, "And a great and
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:23.840]   strong wind tore the mountains and broke into pieces the rocks before the Lord." Some of your
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:29.120]   translations actually says that it's a hurricane that came in, right? The language is it wasn't just
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:35.080]   a normal strong wind. It was a hurricane that came. Now, I want you to think to yourself, "Why does God
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:41.560]   do this?" Right? Why does God go through all this drama? Who created this wind? Did it just happen
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:47.800]   that when He stood out there, just randomly some wind went by? Who did it? God must have done it.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:53.840]   Like a hurricane and an earthquake and fire all happened just randomly at the same time and said,
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:19:01.200]   "Oh, that wasn't me." Clearly it was God, right? But he said his clear presence wasn't there. Earthquake
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:07.280]   comes next, and you would think like, "Earthquake?" Right? We live in Southern California, so when we
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.440]   hear the word "earthquake," it's like, "Oh, okay. It's just another day." You know? But if you ever have
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:16.720]   friends or cousins that come from the East Coast or the Midwest, and the earth shakes for a
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:23.160]   little bit, they freak out. Right? So the earth shakes. Who did that? It wasn't a train that was going by.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:29.680]   It wasn't a thunder. It was God Himself did it. But He said God wasn't there. Fire comes,
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:39.120]   but nowhere. Fire comes, and God's not there either. Right? Why does He go through all of this drama to
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:44.440]   demonstrate to Elijah that He's not there? So what happens next? God shows up, and He says, "What does
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:53.200]   He say?" At the end of verse 12, "And after the fire, the sound of a low whisper." And that's where He was.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:20:03.880]   Not the hurricane, not the earthquake, and not the consuming fire, and all of these things in the
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:10.240]   past. God showed Himself in those things. But to Elijah specifically, He said He wasn't there. And
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:17.840]   He deliberately shows up as a whisperer. Why does He do that? Because Elijah just experienced this
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:26.320]   fire. He experienced the thunder. He experienced this tremendous power of God, and nothing happened.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:37.000]   Even after all of that, these people aren't going to repent? "I quit!" That's where He was. That's why He
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:46.800]   was in the cave. "I quit!" And so God is trying to show Elijah that you're looking for maybe
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:52.240]   the fire wasn't big enough. Maybe if the thunder was louder. Maybe the earthquake was even bigger.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:59.040]   And He's looking for this mighty power. And He says, "No." He comes in a gentle whisper, and then He
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:05.440]   says, "And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak, just like any other man in the presence
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:13.640]   of His glory, recognizes his sin, and he wraps himself, and he hides. And behold, there came a
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:19.040]   voice to him and said, 'What are you doing here, Elijah?'" The second time asks him, right? "What are you
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:23.640]   doing here?" And he gives the same response, verse 14, "I've been very jealous for the Lord, the God of
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.440]   hosts, for the people of Israel. I've forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:34.040]   your prophets with the sword. And I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life to take it away." After
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:45.760]   all of that, nothing has changed. And they're still trying to kill me. And the response of God, it's
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:55.080]   almost comical, because there's no hoopla. There's no shaking. There's no miracle. He just says, and
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:01.160]   the Lord said to him, "Go back. Go return on your way to the wilderness in Damascus, and let me tell
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:06.840]   you what you're going to do. Go back. There's going to be some remnants. There's Elohim, and my
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:13.560]   people are here." He doesn't say, "The ground's going to shake, and thunder's going to happen." He just
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:24.040]   says, "Go back. Just keep doing what I'm telling you to do." Right? What was his point? God is powerful
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:34.680]   in the thunder, in the earthquake, in the fire, and in the whisper. See, our tendency is, when we think
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:40.200]   about the Holy Spirit and power, we're thinking about something to happen, revival. Like something to
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:45.400]   happen, something to shake me, like get me out. You know, I'm stuck. Get me out. I need a super
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:53.380]   truck. I need a plane. I need something. But it's the description that Paul gives of somebody who
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:23:02.520]   is saved and delivered from sin. It's just his mind. He says, "For those who live according to the flesh
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.760]   set their minds on the things of the flesh. But those who live according to the Spirit set their
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:11.480]   minds on the things of the Spirit." And he just describes, it's just your mind. Your mind is
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:18.040]   different between somebody who's in the Spirit and somebody who's living in the flesh. And again,
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:23.800]   one of the questions I ask is, "Is this describing what you ought to do or who you are?" It's clearly
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:28.120]   an indicative. This is not an imperative. He's describing a Christian and a non-Christian. So,
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:32.440]   the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian was, what's going on in your head?
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:40.560]   Right? It doesn't sound too dramatic. I mean, really? That's it? I know some of you guys were
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:45.920]   waiting all week to think, like, "What is he gonna say? What's the answer?" Like, "Give me the answer
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:52.840]   so that I can have sanctification." Well, I mean, it just seems so mundane. But I want to show you,
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:24:02.320]   oftentimes what we're looking for may be no different than what the Jews were looking for.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:10.200]   Remember what he says? "The Jews asked for signs and the Greeks looked for wisdom, but we preached
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:17.960]   Christ crucified." And I'm gonna keep reading. He says, "But we preached Christ crucified, a stumbling
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:21.680]   block to Jews and a folly to the Gentiles, but to those who are called both Jews and Greeks,
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:27.240]   Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God. For the foolishness of God is wiser than men,
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:34.160]   and the weakness of God is stronger than men." What you consider to be powerful, in God's eyes,
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:42.040]   is weakness. 1 Corinthians 1:18, "For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing,
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:48.240]   but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God." So, when we think about this power,
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:53.320]   the Holy Spirit, our first thing is something happening, something rumbling, something's gonna
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:59.720]   happen. But he says, "It's foolish. It's just so mundane. It's the preaching of the cross." In fact,
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:06.160]   there's two areas in the Bible where there's a concentration of the doctrine of the Holy Spirit,
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:14.000]   called pneumatology. Not pneumatology, pneumology, right? So, Chapter 8 is one of them, and then John
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.040]   Chapter 14, 15, 16 is the other. So, can you turn your Bibles to John Chapter 14? This is where Jesus
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:26.600]   prophesies and tells His disciples that the Holy Spirit is going to come. And He explains why the
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:37.080]   Holy Spirit is going to come. Verse 16, Chapter 14, verse 16. He says, "And I will ask the Father,
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:42.800]   and He will give you another Helper to be with you forever." Okay, so one, just remember that. He
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.840]   calls Him Helper, and then verse 26, again, He says, "But the Helper of the Holy Spirit,
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:51.120]   Helper of the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things."
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:56.320]   So, one, He's called the Helper. The purpose of the Holy Spirit coming is to help us. Help us what?
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:02.920]   To continue on, to continue to follow Him. Right? What is He going to do? "And even the Spirit of
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:07.760]   Truth," okay, He's called the Helper, He's called the Spirit of Truth, "whom the world cannot receive,
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:14.000]   because it neither sees Him nor knows Him. You know Him, for He dwells with you, and will be in
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:23.480]   you." And then, if you go further down in verse 26, He describes exactly why He is coming. Verse 26,
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:27.520]   He says, "But the Helper of the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:33.240]   all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you." All right, stop right there.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:39.520]   So, when you look at chapter 14, when Jesus says that the Holy Spirit is going to come, why is the
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:48.240]   Holy Spirit coming? One, to help you. He says, "I'm going where I go, you cannot come." And then He
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.920]   says, "Oh, what about us?" And they're freaking out. And then, so He says in verse 18, "I will not
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:59.040]   leave you as orphans, and I will come to you." And then He's talking about the Holy Spirit. So, in the
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.880]   Holy Spirit, the Helper comes, the Spirit of Truth, "He will bring to remembrance all that I have
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:12.320]   taught you." And then, if you go to chapter 16, verse 7, again He describes the ministry of the
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:17.520]   Holy Spirit. "Nevertheless, I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I go away. For if I do
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:22.480]   not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send Him to you. And when He comes,
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:27.720]   He will convict the world concerning sin, and righteousness, and judgment; concerning sin,
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.480]   because they do not believe in Me; concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father. And
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:36.840]   you will see Me no longer; concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged." So,
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:42.920]   let's put that all together. The Holy Spirit is coming, called the Helper, the Spirit of Truth.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:48.240]   He's going to cause us to remember all that Christ has said. He's going to convict the world of sin,
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:55.760]   and of righteousness. If we were to wrap that up in a short, concise statement, basically what He's
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:05.080]   doing is He's causing us to remember Christ. That's what He said. And what does that mean? What does
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:11.000]   that have to do with when Paul says, "The Holy Spirit, the people who are Christians and non-
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.560]   Christian is what's going on in their mind." Right? People who are of the Spirit have their minds set
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:21.200]   on the things of the Spirit. People of the flesh set their mind on the things of the flesh. Here's
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:28.520]   what's interesting. The word for repentance is "metanoia." And the word "metanoia" literally in
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:34.720]   the Greek is two words put together, "meta" to change, "noia" is the mind. So, the literal
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:40.800]   understanding of this word repentance means to change your mind. So, when Paul says, "A Christian
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:47.280]   and a non-Christian," he's a Christian is somebody whose mind has been changed, who's repented, and
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:53.480]   he no longer looks at the world the same way. That his mind is continually set on the things of the
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:58.840]   Spirit. And the one who's not is the one who's continually set his mind on the flesh. Some of
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:08.840]   you guys who have the NIV translation, the word "flesh" is translated "sinful nature." Okay. Now,
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:14.640]   that's not the literal translation of that word. NIV translated "sinful nature" because they just
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.000]   said, "Well, it means flesh." That's what Paul must mean. So, they basically translated it for you,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:26.240]   interpreted it for you. But the literal word for flesh is just "flesh." So, what Paul really is
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:32.200]   saying is, "A Christian and a non-Christian is somebody who is constantly living, thinking,
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:39.240]   and consumed with the things of this world." You may come to church on Sunday, but the rest of the
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:45.120]   week is your mind is no different than anybody else. But a Christian who's been renewed by the
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:53.040]   Holy Spirit, and because of his faith, is constantly thinking of the things of the Spirit. Next year,
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:30:00.320]   Esther and I are planning our 25th, you know, anniversary. 25th anniversary really is our
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:05.320]   first honeymoon, because our first honeymoon after we got married, we just drove to San Francisco. So,
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.800]   you know, we're trying to... we didn't have money. We were young at that time, so we thought, like,
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.360]   "As long as we're married, it doesn't matter." And then I realized it mattered. And then,
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:17.520]   ever since then, I've been trying to make it up, and we just haven't been able to,
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:24.120]   because we had kids, right? So, next year will be really the first time that we're doing something,
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.040]   and we're kind of, "What are we going to do with the kids? Are we going to take Isaiah? You know,
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.160]   how much is this going to cost? What are we going to do? When are we going to go?" And so,
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:35.840]   I'm constantly, every time I have, I'm trying to research, you know, "Can I save enough points? Can
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:40.960]   I do this and do that? What can I do?" You know? And so, even though it's six months or whatever
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:46.880]   away, you know, my thoughts are on that, because I'm planning and preparing for that. Well, he says,
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:54.440]   a Christian is somebody who believes in the promise of the coming kingdom. And so, as a result of that,
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:31:00.000]   our mind is constantly set on the things of the Spirit. And somebody who's not, who doesn't have
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.560]   faith, no matter how often you go to church, no matter what you do, your mind is constantly set
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:10.880]   on the things, because this is where you belong. See, a Christian is somebody who heard the Gospel
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:18.440]   of Jesus Christ, and when he saw that, he believed. And he repented. He changed his mind. So, if you
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:23.960]   didn't repent, if your mind has not been changed, you wouldn't be a Christian. That's what Paul is
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:29.280]   describing in Romans chapter 8. A person who has repented. And so, in Romans chapter 12, verse 2,
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:34.920]   when he said, "Do not be conformed, but be transformed by," what? "Renewing of your mind." What does the
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:43.440]   renewing of your mind literally mean? Repentant. Repenting. That our mind is constantly being
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:51.760]   renewed and changed and revised. And that's what the Holy Spirit primarily does. That He comes into
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:58.720]   our lives, and He reminds us of what we have in Christ, and why He did it, and who He did it for.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:05.000]   And I believe this. And I believe in the coming Kingdom. And as a result of that, my mind has
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:15.480]   been washed. My brain has been washed. I'm brainwashed. Renewed. Repented. See, people who are
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:23.880]   fleshly is simply unrepentant. Unrepentant. There's nothing that has changed. Unchanged in mind.
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:28.480]   Therefore, they are concerned about the fleshly things. And as a result of that, he says in verse 6,
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:35.840]   it leads ultimately to death. A fleshly mind is somebody who is already dead. Verse 7, their mind
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:41.680]   is hostile to God. If your mind is constantly thinking about this world, and the benefits of
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:47.280]   this world, and this world only, he says you can't please God. You're hostile. Colossians 1:21,
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:53.000]   "And you who once were alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil things." And the reason why they
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.600]   were doing evil things is because their mind is constantly thinking of things that are against
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:03.160]   God. Not only that, in verse 7 it says, "It does not and cannot submit to the law of God." And again,
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:08.600]   I believe that Romans chapter 8 is describing that person. That no matter how much he desires it,
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:15.240]   he cannot. And that's what he says in verse 7. He's not able to please God. In 1 Corinthians 2,
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:20.240]   14 and 16, he says, Paul says, "A natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God,
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:25.320]   for they are folly to him. And he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:32.120]   discerned. The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one. For who has
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:40.000]   understood the mind of the Lord, so as to instruct him, but we have the mind of Christ." Because he
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.840]   can't, he can't even, you know, no matter how much he tries, he can't understand. If he has not
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:50.960]   repented and changed his mind. You know, oftentimes, you know, one of the most common questions that I
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:57.240]   get from people is, "What is the will of the Lord? Should I marry her? Should I go here and do this?"
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:03.800]   Well, that question can't be answered to somebody who is not already following the will of the Lord.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:10.480]   If every other part of your life you're living independent from God, and because this is such
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:15.400]   an important decision, this one thing I want to get right. Everything else I just live independently
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:20.760]   from God. But who I marry, I don't want to get this wrong, so I want His blessing upon this. He says,
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:29.040]   "You can't possibly know that." He said, "A mind who is fleshly is not able to discern the will of God,
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:35.440]   and nor can he even please God." You can do all these external things, but what God desires is
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:43.240]   genuine worship. He says, "He can't please God." Therefore, again, they can't please God. But, he says,
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:50.920]   of a Christian, in verse 9, "You, however, are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit." And as a result of that,
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:58.840]   he says there, "You have life and peace." A person who has been indwelt by the Holy Spirit has life
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:05.480]   and peace. And you'll notice in the Scripture, life and peace always go hand in hand. Because the word
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:13.000]   for peace for a Jew is "shalom." And the word "shalom," peace, is closely related to the word Sabbath.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.840]   Hebrews chapter 4, verse 9, he says, "So then there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God. For whoever
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:25.880]   has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from His." So, the Bible uses the term
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:33.080]   Sabbath and salvation in similar terms. Because what was lost at the fall was when God entered
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:39.880]   into His Sabbath, when we rested and we were living there, when we sinned, He says, "You shall surely die."
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:46.600]   What did death look like? Separation. The Sabbath was broken. And ever since then, we're trying to, God
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:53.080]   was trying to bring Christ to restore what? The Sabbath. So, he says, "A person who has the Holy Spirit
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:36:01.320]   has life and has Sabbath." Because the Holy Spirit, in verse 9, is indwelling in us. He's making
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:07.560]   His dwelling in us. Verse 9, "You are not of the flesh of the Spirit, but in fact the Spirit of God
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:12.760]   dwells in you. And anyone who dwells not have the Spirit of Christ, does not belong to Him. But if
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:17.480]   Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness."
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:24.280]   I hope if you guys were studying this passage this week that you saw that Christ and the Holy Spirit
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:29.640]   is used interchangeably here. Did you catch that? Right? Remember we talked about the Holy Spirit,
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:34.360]   the idea of the Trinity is very difficult to explain. But when you get into the Word, it is
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:39.080]   clearly taught. He says that the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:45.480]   of Christ, He just says, "Spirit of God, Spirit of Christ, does not belong to Him. But Christ is in you,
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:49.720]   although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness." You notice that?
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:57.160]   God, Christ, Holy Spirit is all used interchangeably here. If you notice, John chapter 14, he said, "Well,
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:02.680]   if you go, how come we can't go with you?" And he said, "Do not worry. I will not leave you as orphans.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:09.320]   And when I go, the Helper is going to come." And then in chapter 15, he spends the whole chapter
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:14.840]   talking about, "You cannot bear fruit unless you will do what? Remain in me, continue in me."
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:21.720]   And then he goes back to chapter 16, talking about the Holy Spirit. So chapter 14, he describes the
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:27.640]   Holy Spirit. Chapter 16, he describes the Holy Spirit. And chapter 15, after promising them that
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:32.600]   He's going to continue with them, he says, "You have to remain. If you're going to bear fruit, you have to
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:43.000]   remain with me. Remain. To continue. To rest. To stay." So what Paul is saying here is exactly what John
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.840]   is saying, what he's been saying everywhere else. That the work of the Holy Spirit is to continually
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:56.920]   connect us to Christ. That's the ultimate work of the Holy Spirit, is to continue to connect
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:05.160]   us with Christ. There is only one mediator between us and the Father, and that's Jesus Christ. There's
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:11.560]   nothing else in between. If we put anything else in between, if I just connect with the right person,
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:17.320]   if I connect with the right program, if I was just, if I just went to the right seminary,
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:24.520]   and suddenly we put something between us and Jesus, and we think, "Well, maybe the reason why
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:29.720]   this is happening is because I lack this and this and this." And when the Holy Spirit says, "No, everything
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.280]   that you need for the life of God has been given to you, and I'm not going to leave you as an orphan."
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:39.080]   The Holy Spirit, the Helper, the Spirit of the Truth, He's going to come and remind you of all that I have
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:44.520]   said to you. He's going to take the things that I have done, and He's going to convict the world of sin
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:52.040]   and righteousness. So what is the work of the Holy Spirit? It's to connect us with Christ. A dynamic
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:39:01.160]   relationship with Jesus Christ. And He brings us back to His Word. It is His presence. Presence of
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:08.040]   Christ in our life through the Holy Spirit. In fact, J.I. Packer says of the Holy Spirit, "The greatest
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:16.600]   benefit of the gift of the Holy Spirit is simply His presence." His presence. That the Holy Spirit
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:24.200]   is no longer coming and going. He's not anointing and leaving. He has made a permanent indwelling.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:31.960]   The Scripture says that He was given to us as a deposit, guaranteeing our salvation. Deposit.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:38.440]   Permanently in us. Leading and guiding. So, rest of Chapter 8, He's going to go further into that.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:42.920]   Into what does it mean for the Holy Spirit to intercede on our behalf? We're not going to get
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:48.840]   into that today. But it's if that Holy Spirit is in you, that same Spirit that raised Jesus from the
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:57.800]   dead will also raise you to eternal life. Let me wrap all this up so that we can get to the communion.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:09.800]   I know that at the end of the day, maybe it'd be easier if we had some sort of a Holy Spirit
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:16.920]   encounter. And that's what I used to think too when I was younger. And so, I was thinking, when I was a
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:22.360]   younger Christian, or younger pastor, you know, I came from a charismatic background. That's why I
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:27.080]   got saved. Even though I grew up in a Presbyterian background, I got saved in a charismatic background.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:32.920]   And so, people were doing healing, you know, speaking in tongues, and all the things that you
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:39.560]   know, the charismatics. Well, I fully gave myself to that because if that's the case, then I want it.
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:44.120]   But then there are certain things that just didn't fit spiritually. Like, why are we speaking in tongues
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:47.720]   out loud? And the Bible says that there needs to be an interpreter. And so, there's certain things in
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:52.440]   the Bible that I didn't see fit. But at that time, there were healing services going all around. It's
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:57.080]   not like today. Right now, it's, you know, there's Seeker Friendly, or Reform, the Gospel Center
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:01.400]   movement. And there's different things going on right now. But at that time, it was predominantly
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:05.480]   vineyard, you know, like healing services on Sundays. So, people will go to a Presbyterian
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:11.480]   service in the morning, and go to vineyard at night for healing service. So, I searched for five years,
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:18.360]   you know, looking. If you, if that's the power of the Holy Spirit, I want it. I mean, that would save
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:24.600]   me a lot of time. A lot of time. Instead of expositing the Scripture and telling you about
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:32.040]   Christ, I just knock you to the ground. Right? I mean, what Benny Hinn does, you know, sounds fun.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:40.200]   Take off my jacket and just, and then go home. And revival breaks out. I mean, it'd be easy, right?
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:45.080]   So, I said, "Man, if I had the gift of healing, if I can cast out demons, if I can do that,
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:49.880]   I mean, why not? I don't see in the Bible, it says you can't happen. So, why not?"
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:55.320]   So, I went to every service that had these services at vineyard. And I went, and I sat there. And one
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.680]   time, I took the whole youth group. I think Elder Joe might have been there. I don't remember.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:07.480]   But I exposed our youth group to a lot of stuff. So, I would go to these services and look at it.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:12.600]   And then when they, I remember this one particular service that John Wimber, who was the head pastor
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:17.640]   of that. And he said, "Well, there's 3,000 people in the room." And he said, "Anybody who hasn't seen
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:23.880]   a miracle take place, come out." So, I went up, took the youth group up. And he had three, four people
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:28.760]   sitting up in the front. So, we sat with them. And I surrounded, we sat. And literally, I was,
[00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:33.880]   this, this, this. I wanted front row seats. So, John Wimber came and laid hands. And he was walking.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:38.920]   And there's about four or five other people. And he happened to stop at this one particular guy.
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:44.520]   And it was just me and maybe about 15 other youth group kids that I took. And laid hands on him.
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:52.200]   And then, all of a sudden, he's like, "Whoa, the Holy Spirit worked. This man's leg just grew."
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:59.160]   And he, you know, and he, like, he was just hyping it up. And everybody in the congregation, 3,000
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:06.520]   people, yeah, just clapping. I was confused because I didn't see anything. And what confused me even
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:10.680]   more is that the guy who supposedly the healing happened, he was confused just as I was.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:15.560]   And I was looking at all the youth group groups, like, "Did you see something?" And we're all
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:23.160]   confused. But 3,000 people were convinced because he was hyping it up. And so, afterward, he said,
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:26.840]   and he went and said, "Oh, you know, praise God." And so, he's just like, "Yes, praise God." You
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:31.960]   know. But we could clearly see, sitting there, that he was just as confused as us. So, that service
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:39.160]   ended. 3,000 people left that room saying that they saw a miracle, except us. And I remember
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:47.240]   leaving that thinking, "How much of it is this?" Right? It doesn't mean that it doesn't work. I
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:51.400]   don't, I'm open but cautious. The guys who know what that is, I'm open but cautious. I don't
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:56.040]   believe anything in the scripture that says it can't happen. I think it probably does happen.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:01.160]   Of course, God works miracles. Of course, God answers prayers. Of course, He heals. Right?
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:09.480]   But this sensationalizing of the Holy Spirit actually detracts from the real source what
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:19.720]   God has anointed, which was His Word. He anointed His Word. Foolishness. The Jews were demanding
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:27.400]   signs. Greeks demanding wisdom. But we preach Christ crucified. That it is in His faithful
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:33.320]   teaching and preaching of the Word where the Holy Spirit takes that and unites us with an intimate
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:39.400]   relationship with Christ. And that is the primary, it is not the only work, but it's the primary work
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:45.080]   of the Holy Spirit. Now, some of you guys, again, are going to be sitting here and thinking like,
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:50.840]   "Well, that sounds good, but I don't know if it helps me." Let me put this back to you.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:45:03.160]   Could it possibly be that some of our spiritual frustration is because we have not made up our
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:17.000]   mind that this is what I want? If we put the kind of effort that we put into entertainment,
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:28.760]   would there be revival in your life? Maybe. I'm not saying that it will, but it could.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:34.840]   If we put the kind of energy that we put toward losing five pounds,
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:42.840]   do you think that'll make a difference in your walk with God? If you put half the energy to
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:50.760]   pass a test and get a good grade into the Word of God and communion with Him, do you think that
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:56.360]   will make a difference in maybe the frustration that you have in your walk with God? Could it
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:05.480]   possibly be that it's not because the Holy Spirit is not upon you, but that we haven't made up our
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:16.200]   mind? When Joshua says, "Choose you this day whom you will serve," stop teetering between two views.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:21.160]   If you're going to serve the Lord, serve the Lord. If you're going to serve Baal, serve Baal.
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:27.800]   But you cannot do both. I'm not saying that that answers all the questions, but could it be
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:34.360]   that part of the frustration in our sanctification is because we want both?
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:42.200]   I can't say with absolute certainty that that's what it is,
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:48.200]   but until you have committed your life to Christ wholly, you will never know
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:57.320]   that that simply may be the reason. That your mind is consumed with the things of this world,
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:02.120]   and you want God at the same time. You want revival and intimacy with Christ
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:09.000]   and pursue the frivolous things in the world at the same time. You want to glorify God and yourself
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:15.880]   at the same time. You want the security of money and security of the Holy Spirit at the same time.
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:21.000]   Could it be that the answer is that simple?
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   I don't know, but until we've given our life fully to Christ, we would never know.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:37.160]   I'm going to conclude with this. In Matthew chapter 28, 16 to 20, is a passage where Jesus
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:42.600]   gives the Great Commission, and it's something happened. We usually focus on verse 18 to 20. It
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:47.720]   says, "Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:53.720]   And when they saw him, they worshipped him, but some doubted." So the Great Commission was given
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:48:01.560]   as a result of this phrase. It's because they doubted. And that's why he says, "All authority
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:07.480]   in heaven and earth has been given to me. Go make disciples, baptize in the name of the Father,
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:12.040]   Son, and the Holy Spirit. And lo, I am with you to the end of the age." The reason why he says
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.480]   "All authority in heaven and earth has been given to me, and lo, I am with you to the end of the age,"
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:19.960]   because he says they were worshipping him, and yet some doubted. That's why he says that.
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:27.880]   So the question is, what were they doubting? What were they doubting? They were already
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:34.920]   worshipping him. Right? I mean, if they were doubting, could he possibly be the Messiah?
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:41.960]   They wouldn't be worshipping him. They've already concluded that. To worship somebody that you
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:48.840]   he may not be God would be the greatest blasphemy to a Jew. You would be struck down by lightning
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:53.320]   instantaneously. You would have, I mean, people had leprosy for lesser sins than that.
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:59.880]   They were worshipping him. So what did it mean that they doubted? Remember who they were.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:06.760]   These guys just failed miserably. Jesus going to the cross. He denies him three times.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:12.840]   And then Jesus is resurrected, comes back, and these people have utterly failed.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:22.440]   They have no confidence in themselves. Have you chosen the right people? You're going to use us?
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:29.560]   I believe that they were doubting possibly themselves, and because they were doubting
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:35.240]   themselves, maybe doubting did you pick the right people? And it is in that context, Jesus says,
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:41.320]   his encouragement to them was, "The person who's sending you out, don't forget who I am.
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:49.240]   All authority, every authority above Romans, above the demons, above all rule and authority
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:55.960]   has been given unto me. Therefore, go make disciples. Baptize them in the name of the
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:00.280]   Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And lo,
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:10.760]   I am with you to the end of the age. So go. It's not you. I have empowered you."
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:18.920]   So if we bought into this idea, this satanic idea, that God has given you
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:25.000]   imperatives to follow, and then given you no power to do it. So living in impotence,
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:32.440]   living lukewarm, and living the rest of your life feeling just guilty and just accepting
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:37.880]   the fact where you are, that is satanic. That is not from God. God did not tell us,
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:45.400]   "Go live your life and then withhold the power to do it." He who did not spare his own son,
[00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:51.880]   how will he, along with him, give everything? Would he have just forgiven you of your sins,
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:58.920]   and then not have delivered you from the power which is causing all of this stress and distress?
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:09.000]   By no means. The same God who forgave us is the same God who resurrected Christ. And the same
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:17.880]   God who resurrected Christ is the one who commands us. Live, live worthy of the gospel that you have
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:23.880]   been called to. Would you take some time to pray with me as we prepare for the communion? And again,
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:28.840]   as I mentioned to you earlier, that this message really needs to be seen in the larger context of
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:33.560]   the whole book of Romans and chapter 8. And this is just a part of it. There's other things that
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:38.760]   Paul's going to say about the Holy Spirit. But I think today, as we come to the communion table,
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:44.200]   if you've gotten to a point, you've been a Christian for a while, and you've accepted the
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:48.520]   fact that, you know, we're just failures, and that's just the way it is, you know, and God's
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:55.000]   just going to accept me as I am, you know. To a certain degree, it's true. Our salvation is not by
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:02.600]   our words. But you just quit in your pursuit of holiness. You just accepted the fact that this is
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:12.520]   normal. And you're no longer striving after the things of God. By no means. The whole purpose of
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:18.360]   why he saved us is so that we may have life and have this life abundantly. And maybe you're not
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:25.160]   living that abundant life because you quit. And just like he promised his disciples, "I pray,
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:33.160]   Peter, that your faith would not fail you. Get up and feed my sheep." That maybe we just need
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:39.560]   to make that decision to change our mind, to repent. Or whatever way I was thinking was fleshly,
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:47.160]   that I commit my life to Christ. I stand with Christ. So this morning, as we come to the
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:55.080]   communion table, to examine our hearts to see if we, if our mind and our heart is of the Spirit.
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:59.560]   And if not, take this time to come before the Lord and repent. I want to follow Christ with all
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:05.240]   my heart. I don't want to stand between two worlds. You are my Savior. You are my hope.
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:09.640]   To take that time to pray, and then when you are ready, we want to invite you to come up.
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:17.640]   So as we ask Elder Doe to come up, I'm going to read passage in Corinthians. And then as you are
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:22.920]   ready, again, I want to ask you, if you are a baptized believer, we ask you to come. And you're
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:27.080]   welcome to participate. If you have not been baptized and you are not a believer, that you
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:34.920]   would stay in your seats. Because the baptism is like a wedding ceremony. And communion is kind of
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:39.880]   like an anniversary, remembering. So if you have not been baptized, we ask that you would stay in
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:44.680]   your seats. For those of you who are, again, when you are ready, please come to the two aisles and
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:50.200]   then use the middle aisle to go down. First Corinthians 11 23, "For I received from the
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:54.920]   Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:59.560]   And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, 'This is my body, which is for you. Do this
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:04.920]   in remembrance of me.' In the same way also, he took the cup after supper, saying, 'This cup is a
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:11.320]   new covenant in my blood. Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:17.800]   eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.'" Heavenly Father,
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:24.200]   we come before you at the communion table. Help us, Lord God, to come in thankfulness, in humility,
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:29.960]   in celebration. Lord, all of these things, Lord God, that we can possibly imagine attaining for
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:36.760]   ourselves. We are weak, and the longer we live, the more we are aware just how weak we are.
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:43.480]   I pray, Father God, that in our weakness that Christ would be strong. I pray that your Holy
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:50.360]   Spirit would convict us, that your word would bear fruit in us. Teach us what it means to remain,
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:57.080]   to rest in you. And we ask, Lord God, that this communion table would cause us, Lord God, to be
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:59.280]   stirred toward you.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.120]   Amen.
