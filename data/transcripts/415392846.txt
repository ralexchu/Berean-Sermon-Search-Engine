[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.400]   - Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.320]   Let's take a moment to pray and go before the Lord
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.160]   as we start our weekday Bible study.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.960]   All right, God, we thank you, God, for your truth.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.280]   Lord, we recognize truly how powerful your word is
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.680]   because God, you're a powerful God.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.520]   We thank you so much that this word, which you describe
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.960]   as so precious, more to be desired than money and gold,
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.240]   and sweeter, Father God, than any sweet thing in this world.
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.120]   I do pray that we would all the more experience it, trust,
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.560]   and continue to build our lives upon it.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.360]   And we again want to thank you.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.200]   Week in and week out, we have opportunity to study and learn.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.520]   And we do recognize, God, we feel
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.800]   how it continues to feed our soul
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.120]   and causes us to be strong in faith towards you, Lord.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.200]   We want to thank you again and pray for a fruitful time
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.240]   of study this evening.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.880]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.560]   OK.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.320]   This evening, we are looking at Ephesians chapter 4,
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.360]   verses 11 through 16.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.760]   So let's take a moment to start reading.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.440]   I will start reading in verse 7 because, again, those
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.200]   were connected thoughts.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.840]   And in verse 7, it says, "But to each one of us,
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.200]   grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.120]   Therefore, it says, when he ascended on high,
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.680]   he led captive, a host of captives,
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.880]   and he gave gifts to men."
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.920]   Now, this expression, "he ascended," what does it mean
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.360]   except that he also had descended into the lower
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.720]   parts of the earth?
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.800]   "He who descended is himself also he
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.080]   who ascended far above all the heavens
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.120]   so that he might fill all things."
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.840]   Our passage for today.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.040]   "And he gave some as apostles and some as prophets
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.240]   and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.800]   for the equipping of the saints for the work of service,
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.760]   to the building up of the body of Christ
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.560]   until we all attain to the unity of faith
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.040]   and the knowledge of the Son of God,
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.560]   to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.720]   to the fullness of Christ.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.080]   As a result, we are no longer to be children tossed here
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.840]   and there by waves and carried about
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.360]   by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men,
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.080]   by craftiness and deceitful scheming.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.920]   But speaking the truth in love, we
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.600]   are to grow up in all aspects.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.480]   And to him who is the head, even Christ,
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.000]   from whom the whole body being fitted and held together
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.400]   by what every joint supplies, according
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.520]   to the proper working of each individual part,
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.320]   causes the growth of the body for the building up
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.520]   of itself in love."
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.800]   OK.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.520]   This passage has a lot to say.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.320]   But I do want to make mention of the fact
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.040]   that this is a very pivotal and important passage
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.720]   to the doctrine of the church, namely
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.080]   how the church has been blessed, but also
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.560]   the vision of what the church should be like.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.920]   We're going to start with verse 11 that describes the gift,
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.720]   the gift that Christ has given.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.640]   Remember that in the last passage,
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.560]   we rehearse and review that Christ gave gifts.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.160]   And what he talked about was to each one, God has given gifts.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.040]   Christ as the victor, Christ as the conquering king
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.120]   has been generous with us, has been generous with the church.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.000]   And so he gives gifts to men.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.560]   And he has authority to do so.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.160]   And what he says here is that he gave some to be apostles,
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.480]   and some as prophets, and so forth.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.640]   And so we have to ask the question, OK, so clearly,
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.120]   Christ has been generous.
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.960]   What has he given?
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.200]   And what we already said was that the concept of gift
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.960]   in the New Testament has various different references,
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.640]   everything from your enablement, the skills that you have,
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.240]   your disposition, your character traits, the things
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.920]   that you can use for the church.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.360]   We also talked about the Holy Spirit as a gift.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.480]   We talked about, obviously, having even the collective whole
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.400]   as a gift, but more specifically, specific individuals,
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.760]   the individuals that are given to the church,
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.360]   and here, namely, apostles, prophets, and evangelists,
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.120]   pastors, teachers.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.440]   So we essentially want to say that.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.720]   But what I like to do is whenever I make observations
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.680]   about a passage, and there happens to be a listing,
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.800]   I actually try to list it.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.320]   And I recommend you do the same.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.280]   Why?
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.160]   Because every time you see a list,
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.560]   you do want to observe and ask the questions of,
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.320]   is there a theme there?
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.360]   Is there a sequence?
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.960]   Is there an order?
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.280]   And the observation that I see is that, yes, there
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.960]   does seem to be a sequence.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.920]   Why?
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.480]   Because this order appears in other passages of the New
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.640]   Testament as well.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.560]   For example, 1 Corinthians chapter 12, verse 28 through 31.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.720]   In this passage, Apostle Paul says,
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.440]   "And God has appointed in the church first apostles,
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.120]   second prophets, third teachers, then miracles,
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.320]   then gifts of healing, helps, administration,
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.600]   various gifts of tongues."
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.480]   All are not apostles, are they?
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.360]   All are not prophets, are they?
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.720]   All are not teachers, are they?
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.040]   And so there are specific designated gifts.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   But what's more, there seems to be an order of the gifts,
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.680]   where it says first, second, and third.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.240]   What's more, when we take a look at Ephesians chapter 2,
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.040]   verses 19 through 20, it talks about the building
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.840]   of the house, and there's always a sequence to a build.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.200]   Verse 19 says, "So then you are no longer strangers and aliens,
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.600]   but you are fellow citizens with the saints,
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.560]   and are of God's household.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.360]   Having been built upon the foundation of the apostles
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.600]   and prophets, Christ Jesus himself
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.320]   being the chief cornerstone."
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.840]   So within the blueprint, within your build order,
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.720]   Christ is going to be the cornerstone that
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.960]   sets the lines.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.760]   He's going to be the one that sets
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.200]   the trajectory of how things should be laid out.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.760]   And there is the foundation, the doctrinal foundation
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.400]   of the teachings that have been given to the apostles
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.040]   as ones sent from Christ.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.920]   That being the case, there is significance to these things,
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.960]   that there is this order by which Christ has given,
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.160]   as a very then valuable and significant gift,
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.280]   that the church should have these apostles, prophets,
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.080]   shepherds, evangelists, pastors, and teachers.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.880]   Now in thinking about that, though,
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.000]   we take a look at the list and we're kind of wondering,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.720]   OK, so there seems to be an order.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.400]   There seems to be a significance.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.520]   But how do they differ?
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.560]   Who are these people?
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.680]   Is there any similarity?
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.760]   Those kind of questions are all questions maybe we should ask.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.320]   But one other interesting thing that we notice
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.040]   is that some of the terms in the Bible that we see,
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.200]   we actually don't see in this list.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.720]   So this is something-- you don't have to jot down everything
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.320]   because it's going to take you a while.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.520]   But I just wanted you to notice that within the Bible,
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.200]   there are lots of different titles for people.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.160]   There are different types of leadership.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.880]   So some of the ones that we're more accustomed to
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.480]   and hear often are elders.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.080]   How come they're not on the list?
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.680]   They're like leaders of the church.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.360]   Deacons and servants who are ministers,
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.200]   like why aren't they on the list?
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.600]   What's going on?
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.040]   And so an important observation that we make is this, OK?
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.480]   An important observation is that there is a unifying form--
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.240]   sorry, a unifying function of the individuals
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.840]   that have been listed.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.080]   And what is that unifying function?
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.240]   That unifying function is that all of them
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.200]   have to do with the teaching of the foundational doctrines
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.560]   of Christ, essentially the proclamation of the truth.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.240]   Pretty much all the commentators that I read kind of uniformly
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.040]   agreed that the highlight of this
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.200]   is as he comes down this list, apostles and prophets,
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.000]   these are not offices for the church.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.080]   The highlight is not the offices of the church.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.040]   Why?
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.040]   Because we have not been given instructions,
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.880]   go therefore and establish apostles at your church.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.080]   Those are uniquely God-given specific roles and privileges
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.760]   in the sense that Christ has given them authority
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.840]   to teach with his authority.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.360]   And upon that teaching that has been handed down to us
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.360]   once and for all, we are continuing to minister the truth.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.280]   OK?
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.160]   So that being the case,
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.000]   clearly this is not a delineation of,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   these are all the offices you should have at your church.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.880]   'Cause some of them are already passed.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.000]   They don't exist anymore, right?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.320]   But rather it is highlighting this idea.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.440]   A gift to us is the word.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.920]   The word is light.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.240]   The word is better than sweet honeycomb, better than money.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.440]   The word is better than the wisdom of the world.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.560]   The word is actually better than you
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.880]   trying to go and pursue happiness in life.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.040]   Why?
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.920]   Because the word is God's reality.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.680]   And living in God's reality is the greatest blessing.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.280]   What am I trying to say here?
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.280]   We should meditate on the fact that the invaluable,
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.240]   the precious gift that God has given,
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.080]   yes, are these individuals.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.720]   But these individuals have a primary function of teaching.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.480]   They are to be the ground laying workers in the church
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.280]   who have laid a foundation of doctrines for us to believe.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.680]   And therefore hitting this idea again for our church.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.720]   Let's take a moment to meditate on that.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.240]   If, if we jettison the preaching of God's word
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.960]   faithfully to you,
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.520]   we are completely jettisoning Christ's gift, right?
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.800]   If the foundational truths that we have been receiving
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.240]   and our role then as pastors and teachers
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.360]   are to give to you as a blessing to the church,
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.640]   as an edifying force in the church,
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.960]   as a sanctifying force in the church,
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.400]   we're completely misusing God's gift.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.080]   It would be like having this, like a Apple product,
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.840]   which is a laptop computer that I bought five years ago,
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.280]   serving me well.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.200]   It's useful for preparing sermons,
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.800]   studying, typing up my notes.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.160]   It's powerful equipment, right?
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.760]   But instead I'm like, nice, thank you.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.800]   And I started saying,
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.240]   let me turn up the screen brightness and use it as a lamp.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.760]   So I could use my number two pencil
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.440]   and write down my notes on a piece of paper, right?
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.520]   Like that would be ridiculous.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.560]   What a waste.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.720]   Yeah, as a matter of fact,
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.640]   if we continue to jettison God's word within the church,
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.680]   absolute waste, but more than that,
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.240]   in Old Testament,
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.240]   if God has given us the blessing of the truth,
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.080]   meaning if God has given the nation of Israel,
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.640]   his proclamation,
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.680]   and they instead turn to the wisdom of the world,
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.960]   it's like, but they have kings over there.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.480]   If they turn to the wisdom of Egypt and say,
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.920]   but that nation is powerful.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.440]   That is not seen as a waste.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.400]   That is seen as betrayal.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.440]   This loyalty and a front against God's gift, right?
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.360]   Now, why am I saying this?
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.320]   Is because even in our day,
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.480]   there are things that people turn to
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.680]   aside from the word of God.
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.760]   And the point that I'm making is not so much like,
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.600]   whoa, right?
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.160]   It's just simply that not everything is neutral.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.280]   Things compete for our loyalties.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.840]   Things compete for our mind and our heart.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.600]   And what's more,
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.040]   we always want to think and consider
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.120]   our Lord Jesus Christ in his victorious nature
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.000]   has given the church various gifts.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.520]   And then for us to not fully commit,
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.080]   not fully accept it would be a big, big offense to him.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.880]   Okay, number two.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.840]   In number two, the scripture says,
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.560]   for the equipping of the saints for the work of service
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.960]   to the building up of the body of Christ.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.840]   So Christ has a very specific intent
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.200]   of why he gave those gifts to the church.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.400]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.320]   The intent.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.320]   And so what we want to say is purpose, objective.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.040]   What does God purpose in the teaching of the word,
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.080]   in the various titles and positions that are there?
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.360]   And also more specifically,
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.360]   these gifts in history that God has given
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.400]   in terms of specifically the apostles, prophets,
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.760]   evangelists and so forth.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.600]   Okay?
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.600]   So when we take a look at this passage again,
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.080]   I just want to highlight that in good Bible study,
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.000]   we pay attention to prepositions.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.280]   Why?
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.800]   These prepositions I highlight for you.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.520]   For, for, to.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.680]   Prepositions just gives you relationships
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.200]   between words and nouns, right?
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.320]   And phrases.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.120]   So what you should be thinking is,
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.760]   what is the relationship of thought here?
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.640]   And you totally see a progression.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.600]   This is for the purpose of this and for the purpose of that.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.880]   And you just naturally see a build.
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.800]   Okay, I just want to highlight that.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.200]   And what's more, he says that this is for the equipping,
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.520]   working and building.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.040]   So there are some unique terms
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.640]   that we should pay attention to.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.480]   I just want to comment on these just briefly here.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.000]   First, I actually want to start with the idea
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.480]   of building up the body of Christ.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.000]   Let's take a moment to think about this.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   An objective and purpose that I know God is doing right now.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.520]   He desires in this day, in our generation,
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.360]   but also in this day, to continue to build up his church.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.040]   That is something I know for sure.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.160]   People ask me sometimes for advice.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.880]   Is it God's will for me now to do this?
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.080]   Is it for now God's will for me to do that,
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.040]   to be single, to be in this job?
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.240]   And there's a lot of questions.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.200]   Now, a lot of times we recognize
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.720]   that there's a general will of God.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.920]   He always wants to draw you near to him.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.840]   He wants to build you up in your character
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.040]   that's more closer to his own image.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.440]   He wants to make sure that he's sanctifying you.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.040]   He's all that stuff, right?
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.680]   But one of the short things we can say is,
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.520]   this is a purpose, an objective of God.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.560]   And what's really interesting is that he uses a term
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.600]   that has a very kind of literal and specific nuance,
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.760]   which is, he's not just generally building,
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.920]   it literally means to be building a home.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.880]   It's there in the Greek, oikodome, okay?
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.560]   Oikodome.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.800]   And so when we think about that,
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.600]   we recognize that what he is building,
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.760]   we rehearse what he said before, it is his dwelling.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.640]   When you think about his church,
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.840]   what we have here at Berean,
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.200]   again, by our eyes,
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.560]   we just see a gathering of a mass of people.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.000]   But what we should be also seeing
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.200]   is God is building his loving home.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.800]   God is building his dwelling place.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.680]   He said his temple, right?
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.880]   And so here's this question then for us,
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.160]   for us, we have to ask this question.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:06.160]   Have I also then bought into that objective and purpose?
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.560]   Is that to me, something of a conviction?
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.280]   I know what God is doing,
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.960]   and therefore I've completely aligned myself
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.280]   to that goal and purpose.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.240]   If that's his intention, so is mine.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.600]   What's more, he says to that end,
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.120]   there should be equipping of the saints
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.080]   for the work of service, okay?
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.120]   Equipping of the saints for the work of service.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.520]   Let's ask this question.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.640]   What does it mean to equip, okay?
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.120]   We recognize that clearly for the building up of the church,
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.800]   the building up of the church does not happen
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.040]   just because we have crazy professionals.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.480]   The building up of the church does not happen
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.840]   just because we have crazy finances
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.360]   and a crazy building, right?
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.880]   The building up of the church happens
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.680]   through the equipping of the saints for the work of service.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.720]   But what does this equipping mean?
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.360]   I highlight it because the definition of this term
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.160]   when we do a word study specifically of equipping,
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.040]   it is the word, "Ketartismus,"
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.720]   and it means perfection or completion.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.440]   The word dictionary of the New Testament says
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.840]   this differs from another term, "Ketartisis,"
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.080]   which is talking about the act of fitting something in
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.720]   or making perfect.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.640]   But he says the term used here is actually talking about,
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.400]   it denotes the process as completed.
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.200]   So what am I saying?
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.920]   I recognize from that, that when we think of equipping,
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.040]   we're probably thinking of something far too narrow.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.480]   What do I mean?
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.760]   I think in error, sometimes when we think of equipping,
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.000]   we think of educational study.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.920]   We think of let's run a class.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.520]   Let's have this training where you sit
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.920]   and a pastor teaches you, right?
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.480]   And then, or what's more, we say, you know what?
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.400]   You should tag me.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.160]   You should tag along with what I do,
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.240]   and we should kind of do it like maybe the medical field.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.120]   You're gonna be a resident,
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.200]   and you're just gonna walk alongside me, right?
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.480]   But when we think about equipping,
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.640]   here, it's a pretty broad term,
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.200]   general perfection and completion.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.320]   Now, here's another passage in Hebrews 13, it says this,
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.120]   "Now the God of peace who brought up from the dead
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.440]   "the great shepherd of the sheep
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.920]   "through the blood of the eternal covenant,
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.360]   "even Jesus our Lord,
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.680]   "equip you in every good thing to do his will,
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.720]   "working in us that which is pleasing in his sight,
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.800]   "through Jesus Christ to whom be the glory
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.480]   "forever and ever, amen."
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.720]   So what we see there is the equipping
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.400]   should be in every good thing.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.480]   Why do I bring this up?
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.160]   Because the tendency that I see sometimes
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.960]   is a lot of times people have a narrow view
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.480]   of what equipping means.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.280]   Typically, they think equipping to lead a small group,
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.000]   equipping to lead and teach,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.120]   equipping to be essentially somebody
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.320]   who is higher up on the hierarchy.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.560]   But that's not necessarily the case.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.800]   Because plus, not only is the term broader than that,
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.520]   we recognize that generally
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.400]   as the scripture speaks about equipping,
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.360]   it is not just education.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.600]   To do a specific task such as leading.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.600]   Do equipping comes to us through the scriptures primarily?
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.440]   Yes.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.480]   I mean, 2 Timothy 3.16,
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.560]   "The word of God is sufficient for everything,
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.400]   "to make us wise unto salvation,
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.440]   "but to make sure that we are all equipped,
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.480]   "thoroughly equipped that we can be,
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.200]   "you know, to do every work."
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.720]   However, the scriptures talk about the fact
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.200]   that our prayers continue to equip us.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.160]   What's more, the exhortation that we hear
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.280]   from our brothers and sisters,
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.440]   the accountability, the admonishment to flee sin
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.160]   and to obey in greater measure,
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.960]   that's all equipping too.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.240]   The testing and suffering, whoa.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.520]   Testing and suffering is actually a huge disciplinary,
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.160]   equipping and training.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.360]   I mean, you think about the passage in James,
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.040]   you think about the passage in 1 Peter 1,
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.320]   we essentially need to go through these various trials
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.560]   because those trials is going to have
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.440]   its necessary effect in us.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.120]   What I'm saying is, more broadly speaking,
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.440]   the scripture is talking about equipping
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.960]   maybe more than what perhaps we presume equipping might mean.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.920]   The observation and engagement of our community,
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.000]   the people around us who are mature,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.640]   the practice of our faith in discernment.
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.720]   Scripture essentially says,
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.560]   our maturity is going to come,
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.720]   our discernment is going to come
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.520]   by those who actually practice it
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.800]   and in greater measure,
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.720]   a fuller application of what we already know.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.440]   And so Apostle Peter says, "You know what?
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.200]   "I don't mind repeating stuff over and over again."
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.320]   And as a matter of fact, I think about my own ministry,
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.400]   just the teaching that I've done over the years.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.880]   And in that teaching,
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.120]   there's so many things I repeated
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.920]   over and over again.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.240]   And thank goodness the word of God
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.960]   never ceases to amaze, it's so deep.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.240]   But a lot of that actually is repetition
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.480]   of the same concepts,
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.880]   just in fuller measure and fuller application.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:47.880]   And so all that to say is,
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.240]   I want you to take a moment to think about this.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.080]   If I'm not thinking like,
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.320]   "Yeah, I need to be equipped to lead."
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.880]   But I'm thinking like,
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.120]   "I need to be equipped to go love my brother,
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.080]   "to bear his burdens."
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.040]   Like what is it that you're not equipped with
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.600]   that you can't go to a brother and be like,
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.760]   "How are you doing this week?"
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.480]   Especially during this time of the shelter at home,
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.360]   "Are you doing okay?"
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.200]   Brother says, "Yeah, I'm struggling
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.040]   "with this and this and this."
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.280]   And he says, "I'll pray for you."
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.960]   Call him again and say, "You know, no, I was just curious,
[00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:14.920]   "like how are your parents doing?
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.120]   "'Cause man, they are at risk and stuff like that.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.320]   "And I know their health is not good.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.240]   "Are they doing okay?"
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.440]   And you continue to check up on him.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.680]   And then you start saying, "Oh, you share,
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.040]   "can I share with you my encouragements
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:24.880]   "and how I'm struggling?"
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.400]   And you go and interact.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.720]   And then you eventually say to like,
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.080]   "More specifically with your love for Christ
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.920]   "and your private faith in the Lord,
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.160]   "like how's that doing?
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.600]   "What equipping do you lack?"
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.960]   I'm saying this not to say that you don't need training
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.880]   and that equipping is all bad.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.160]   I'm saying this to say that perhaps sometimes
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.760]   what we think about as equipping
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.520]   is not necessarily done specifically
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.760]   in a formalized classroom setting,
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.960]   which a lot of people sometimes expect.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.600]   And so I just wanted to highlight that by saying
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.360]   the equipping is probably broader
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.840]   than what we normally may think of.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.280]   Next, as we think about this though,
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.840]   Apostle Paul has shown to us Christ's intent
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.480]   as he gives gifts,
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.640]   that he desires this purpose that the saints be equipped,
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.400]   that we be trained and that we are grown
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.200]   and that we're maturing by doing the works of service,
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.840]   the works of service that includes far more
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.440]   than just leading stuff.
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.720]   Works of service that means serving the brother next to us,
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.120]   serving the needs that we see
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.000]   and applying everything that we can.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.120]   And then what he says is,
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.680]   "All of that is going to build to
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.880]   "until we all attain and have this result."
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.400]   So the way I label this is when I see again,
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.920]   these prepositional phrases,
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.920]   "Until we all attain to and as a result,"
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.960]   I should be thinking, man, this is like a broader goal.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.240]   Like God has a very order and structure
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.080]   where he's thinking there are purposes and objectives
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.080]   that are leading to a grand vision of the church.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.000]   And that's why this passage is great and amazing
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.520]   and we should take time to appreciate it
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.480]   because it gives to us kind of the idea that God has
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.520]   when he's thinking about the picture of the church.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.960]   And what does he say?
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.680]   He says, "Until we all attain to the unity of faith
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.800]   "and of the knowledge of the son of God,
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.480]   "to a mature man and to the measure of the stature
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.220]   "which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.240]   "As a result, we are no longer to be children
[00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.000]   "tossed here and there by waves
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.920]   "and carried about by every wind of doctrine
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.400]   "by the trickery of men,
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.720]   "by craftiness and deceitful scheming.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.200]   "But speaking the truth in love,
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.800]   "we are to grow up in all aspects
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.480]   "into him who is the head, even Christ."
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.280]   Brothers and sisters, this is a tall, tall order.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.320]   This is a big vision.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.360]   This is perhaps in some people's mind like impossible, right?
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.560]   This is huge.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.520]   So let's take a moment to appreciate all this stuff.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.960]   First, he talks about the unity of faith.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.200]   Unity of faith.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.920]   He is talking about the fact that we have this one baptism,
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.920]   one faith, one spirit, one father, one truth.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.940]   And so we are bound together in such a way
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.440]   where we have the same dedication
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.560]   to the same doctrine, the same truth.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.920]   And so we're supposed to have in other parts of scripture
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.480]   a same intent.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.920]   Intent on the same thing, set on the same purposes.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.400]   And the passage actually commands us
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.760]   to have similarity of mind.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:36.120]   Now, somebody perhaps might look at that and say,
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.080]   "What?
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.540]   "What a herd mentality, right?
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:43.120]   "We're being brainwashed to think the exact same stuff."
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.920]   But the thing about it is, yes, if we have a unity,
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.860]   but for the sake of pragmatism or practicality,
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.920]   you all should just believe what I say,
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.360]   then that would be wrong.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.600]   Or if in the sense of, "Hey, this is not gonna work
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.320]   "if we have different types of people,
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.160]   "so we're just gonna all move in the same pattern,"
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.680]   that would be wrong.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.440]   But the fact of the matter is we are one herd.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.340]   We're sheep.
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:09.520]   But the great truth is we are sheep of the great shepherd.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.240]   And just like that video we saw a couple of weeks ago,
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.200]   we all perk up when we hear the voice of our master,
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.200]   and we all come running
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.520]   when we hear the voice of our master.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.920]   That is no faulty thing, that is no foolish thing,
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.920]   when in fact you have the foundation of God's own voice
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.360]   being what unites us.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.780]   It would be a foolish thing
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.960]   to just be thinking outside the box
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.080]   for the sake of thinking outside the box.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.680]   You can't be different just to be different.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.800]   That in and of itself is also foolishness as well.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.960]   But the point that I'm kinda getting at here is this.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.840]   The kind of unity that God desires to see in us,
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.360]   the degree and level of like-mindedness
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.440]   that God wants to see in all of us,
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.640]   I want us to understand that that unity is so high
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.160]   'cause he wants us to have that element
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.680]   where we are of absolute one faith.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:02.040]   So moving forward to next, the knowledge of the Son of God.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.040]   I would like to highlight and draw your attention
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.200]   to an observation of a word study here
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.220]   on the term knowledge.
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.640]   In the Greek there are several terms for the word to know.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.080]   There's oida, there's gnosko.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.240]   This passage particularly uses the word epignosko.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.320]   It is absolutely intensified.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.200]   Again, from the word dictionary of the New Testament,
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.760]   it says, "This knowledge is intensified
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.320]   because it expresses a more thorough participation
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.080]   in acquiring of the knowledge on the part of the learner.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.460]   It often refers to knowledge
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.160]   which very powerfully influences
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.000]   every form of religious life,
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.280]   a knowledge-laying claim to personal involvement."
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.740]   Take a moment to think about that,
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.520]   that your experiences,
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.360]   it's both personal,
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.160]   there is personal investment and engagement.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.040]   And all of that happens to surround your experience
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.240]   with the person of Christ, right?
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.920]   If you've had experience with another individual
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.400]   and you've had shared life patterns
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.800]   and moments when you can, you know, reminisce together,
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.320]   those are such unique ties.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.960]   Right now, a lot of people are sharing their reflections
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.640]   but also their testimony
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.200]   and moments of hardship that drawn them closer to God
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.520]   on the Facebook and over the internet.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:19.640]   And some people comments like,
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.320]   "Oh, I remember your before Christ days
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.080]   and you're crazy and all that kind of stuff."
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:24.920]   And then they're like,
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.160]   "But remembering Christ, how He's good to you,
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.520]   how He changed you, like, thank you so much for sharing."
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.600]   And when we do that, there is immediately a connection.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.880]   Because we're talking about the picture of the church,
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.440]   think about this, every single one of us
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.960]   has some of the most moving
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.560]   and deepest experiences with Christ.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.500]   And we all can share it
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.040]   because we've been walking with the Lord.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.200]   What an amazing thing that would be.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.720]   What's more, he says, that there should be maturity,
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.960]   maturity, that we would all, again,
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.440]   this is not satisfied with a bunch of people,
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.560]   with a bunch of people over here
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.060]   and a bunch of people over there being mature,
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:04.560]   but until we all attain to the maturity, that of Christ.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.800]   And I want you to think about this.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.280]   I mean, to the church,
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:12.900]   its unity would be so developed and heightened
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.760]   if people were growing in their personal maturity.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.440]   If we were selfish, we would be thinking,
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.520]   "You know what?
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.640]   I want what I want, I want it now."
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.420]   Like, that would be absolute childishness, right?
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.640]   That's immaturity.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.920]   A lack of self-control, it's like,
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.900]   "I'm just gonna do it, I don't care.
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.160]   Not thinking about consequences.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.360]   I don't care if it hurts you, who cares?"
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.360]   Like, that's all childishness.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.160]   But if you're able to think about having self-control,
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.820]   being able to die to self,
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.480]   having that kind of maturity
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.440]   to think above and beyond your own wants,
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.300]   that would be such a thing
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.420]   where our Father in heaven would look down.
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.440]   And again, because we're talking about the grand vision,
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.980]   think about the vision of the Father.
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.520]   Why would He not want us to mature in that fashion?
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.560]   Us as His sons and daughters.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.860]   And you know, I do believe
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.300]   that there is this interaction
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.260]   where God is looking at His sons and daughters
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.840]   and desiring to be proud
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.360]   as we grow in maturity towards the image of Christ.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.140]   There's a thought that I think about.
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.600]   One time I went on a mission trip
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.620]   and you know, even with a great team,
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.940]   sometimes within mission trips,
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.220]   as you're trying to do hard stuff,
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.380]   moving from here to here and the discomforts,
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:19.980]   there was some strife.
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.780]   And there was this time, there was an intense moment
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.820]   where it started getting all kind of crazy.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.940]   Some words were said,
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.900]   words weren't, you know, weren't careful.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.220]   And then things started to escalate.
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.660]   And within that kind of escalation,
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.060]   things got really heated and emotional and stuff like that.
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.940]   But one of the team members,
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:40.260]   as they kind of noticed and saw,
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.940]   they could have easily just been like,
[00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.100]   what's going on?
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:43.940]   Right?
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.420]   And been like, I'm out of here.
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.260]   No, thank you.
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.100]   Right?
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.220]   But instead they stepped in.
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.940]   Now they didn't step in a manner where it was like,
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:50.760]   you know what?
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.600]   What are you talking about?
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.420]   What are you talking about?
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:53.260]   And say your piece.
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.100]   Right?
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:54.920]   It wasn't like that.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.580]   They stepped in with a sense of just like,
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.420]   you know what?
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:58.780]   I want to take responsibility.
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.500]   Like we could have done a lot better.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:01.340]   Right?
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:02.180]   Apologize.
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.440]   They heard the personnel
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.260]   and they completely deescalated by their humility,
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:07.820]   their willingness to absorb.
[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:10.640]   Like maybe their expectation was wrong.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.720]   Maybe their expectation was unfair,
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.560]   but nevertheless,
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.760]   they like submitted to one another in that fashion.
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.180]   Man, on the bus ride home,
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.380]   I was just like so proud of them.
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.660]   I leaned over and I was like,
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.940]   so proud of you, you know?
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.500]   Because I was.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.340]   But again,
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.500]   thinking about the larger church picture,
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.500]   when we are exercising greater maturity
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:34.060]   because of our ability to express
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.700]   and do what Christ has done,
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.300]   our father would be proud.
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.620]   Now, moving forward,
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.540]   here in this passage,
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.460]   it says to the measure,
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.300]   or sorry,
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.700]   yeah, to the measure of the stature,
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.120]   which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.740]   If you actually take a moment to think about that,
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:50.700]   that's crazy.
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.180]   To the stature of Jesus Christ?
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.900]   This must be talking about the end times.
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:55.740]   This must be talking about
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.780]   when we're glorified in heaven.
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.620]   No.
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:03.340]   Our God desires us to move in that direction now.
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.780]   And even if we think in our own minds,
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.540]   like that's like asking us to clean the ocean.
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:11.820]   Can't do that.
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:12.860]   I'm a land animal, right?
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.540]   Like what are we supposed to say to that
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.300]   when God asks us to do something far above beyond
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.660]   what we think is capable?
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.420]   God's going to look at us and say,
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:23.540]   how many things that I call you to do
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:26.100]   that's impossible for man,
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.620]   but that he is going to empower.
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.120]   And so be encouraged that this desire of God
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:33.420]   to strengthen and cause us to mature
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:37.380]   to the measure of Christ is something he is working in us.
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.980]   And he desires to see in the grand picture,
[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.260]   all of us attain to that.
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.060]   And the question to you is,
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.940]   have you said, yes, Lord, thank you.
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:49.580]   Or have you said, no, Lord, that's impossible.
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.700]   That is for us to submit to,
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.180]   not only submit to, but buy into.
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.000]   And then he says, as a result,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.620]   we are no longer children,
[00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.980]   tossed here and there by waves and carried about
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.600]   by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men,
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:05.780]   by craftiness and deceitful scheming.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:07.300]   But speaking the truth in love,
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.660]   we are to grow up in all aspects into him,
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:12.620]   who is the head, even Christ.
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.100]   Let's take a moment to think about that again,
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:17.220]   continuing this vision, the goals,
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:19.540]   he wants the resulting effect
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.900]   to be that we are like adults.
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:22.940]   We're maturing in a way
[00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.700]   where we're no longer like children,
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.340]   tossed here and tossed there.
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.680]   And he described what children are like.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.380]   What are children like?
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:33.500]   Well, we can think about everything wrong with children,
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.280]   but here he's talking specifically about the fact
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.920]   there is no stability.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.620]   You're just tossed here and there.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:42.760]   Car goes by, you're chasing that.
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.440]   Ball rolls by, you're chasing that.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.400]   Horses just come and you're way over there.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.840]   And rather than being able to resist the tides
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:49.680]   that are coming,
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.080]   you're locked up and you're miles away from home, right?
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:57.280]   What's more, being unable to discern,
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.560]   this is false, right?
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.660]   Adulthood means you've experienced life enough,
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.440]   you've exercised your brain,
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.160]   you've learned something to the degree that you can say,
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.360]   that's not true.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.520]   We should grow in our ability to do that.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.160]   What's more, being able to tell
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.560]   what is the crafty scheming of our enemy,
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.120]   that we're able to exercise our discernment
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.800]   and that we're able to see these are not in pattern
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.360]   in keeping with God's truth.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.320]   We're supposed to be able to do those things.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.000]   And the question is, are you growing in them?
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.360]   Are you learning to be able to discern?
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.680]   And rather than just going here and there,
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.560]   rather than following words here and word there,
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.160]   we are to be able to have the word of God in us
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:42.080]   that we are able to speak the truth in love.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.920]   And that's the kind of maturity and adulthood
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.800]   that God wants to see.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.200]   And the thing about it is simple,
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.640]   speak the truth in love.
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.480]   It's not that easy, is it?
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.520]   I mean, as a father,
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.840]   I want so dearly to speak to my children always
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.320]   with both strong instruction,
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.560]   but to make sure they know I love them.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.600]   You know, I'm sure you guys can relate.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.280]   It's difficult to not speak truth
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.320]   with a tone of annoyance, right?
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.080]   Like, what are you doing?
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:15.480]   Right, it's just so hard not to be so annoyed.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.640]   But the thing about it is maturity will teach you,
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.520]   and through the practice of speaking truth,
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.160]   you have to do it in love, you realize.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.000]   Why?
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.160]   Because scripture straight up tells you,
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.200]   you're going to be noisy.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.360]   If we think, you know what, I want to speak truth,
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.000]   I'm just going to say whatever comes,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.320]   and you take it, that's like machine gunning everybody,
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.360]   it's like, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.960]   and I hope that it hits you, right?
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:37.360]   No, it's not going to, you're just going to spray.
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.200]   You're not going to be poignantly hitting what's needed,
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.920]   and you're going to be useless.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.360]   Scripture says that you need to speak with love.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:48.160]   On the flip side, if you speak just with care and sympathy,
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.560]   but you have no truth, then how useful are you?
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.960]   You might make someone momentarily feel better,
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.920]   but you might actually hurt them.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.040]   You might hurt them more than they are now.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.600]   You might give them your pity,
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.800]   but you're not giving them the pity of Christ.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.000]   You're going to be completely missing the mark.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.640]   And so the maturity and the adulthood that God wants to see
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.200]   is us being able to grow in truth, all in love.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.520]   And he says, we are to grow up in all aspects,
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.760]   into him who is the head, even Christ.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.160]   Take a moment to think about
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.400]   the kind of thoroughness of maturity,
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.160]   the picture that God has in terms of
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.520]   how he wants us to be sanctified.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.120]   He says in all aspects, right?
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.040]   Grow up in it all.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.320]   And I want you to think about that.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.680]   Have you truly bought into that mentality?
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.320]   Do you have the attitude
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.720]   that there is going to be a comprehensive growth?
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.720]   Where yes, there is no element of your life where you're like,
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.040]   you know what, I've always been like this.
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.000]   I'm not going to change.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.160]   Come on now, don't say that.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.160]   If you think, you know what, this is too hard for me,
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.840]   don't say that.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.120]   Because yes, that is just a universal fact.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.440]   So many things are way too hard for us.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.800]   But we have the Lord and he's saying
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.680]   that his grand desire is that this whole church,
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:06.120]   all of us, until we all attain to the measure of Christ.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.240]   And in thinking about this,
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:11.520]   I want to use an example of a difference of attitude.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.000]   You know, imagine if you signed up for softball,
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.320]   you're like, all right, everybody's all about sports
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.680]   at this church, I'll play softball.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.880]   And so you go out to the field and you're swinging around.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.840]   You've hit before, you know, you've played before,
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.440]   but you're no pro, you know.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.960]   You're just swinging that bat and some guy comes around
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.640]   and he thinks he's your coach.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.000]   And he's like, hey, choke up on that bat.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.360]   Clearly you haven't practiced enough.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.760]   You don't have used to the weight of the bat.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.800]   You're like, whoa, right?
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.680]   And he says, hey, your head's all bobbing around.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.240]   What are you, a bobble head?
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.440]   You got to keep your head straight,
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.440]   look at that ball and not look away, right?
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.760]   Eye on the ball the whole way through
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:46.960]   until it makes contact.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:50.000]   And you're kind of like, huh, pad it up to here.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.840]   And he starts telling you like, move your feet.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.440]   How come you don't twist your hips?
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.960]   You have no power, right?
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.640]   And all of a sudden he is looking at every aspect
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.680]   of your swing.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:03.000]   And now you're just annoyed as can be.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.960]   Like, hey man, who told you you were a coach?
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.240]   Pastor Mark, who is this guy, right?
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.280]   You would be so annoyed.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.120]   But instead, if you were this professional athlete
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.520]   playing for the Giants, I don't know who he is,
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.760]   but he wants to know every single aspect of his swing
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.840]   that's not right.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.440]   As a matter of fact, he would hire a batting coach
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.640]   to look at him.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.640]   And if he had a batting coach who wasn't skilled,
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.040]   he'd be like, hey man, that's your job.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.160]   You need to look at me.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.960]   Am I moving my head?
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.080]   Are my feet balanced?
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.640]   Like, do I have strength in my head?
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.760]   Like, you need to tell me 'cause that's your job, man,
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.120]   'cause he would want to know, why?
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.760]   Because he would want to perfect every single aspect
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.600]   of his swing because a little bit off
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.320]   means he's not making contact.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:46.200]   He's not on cue.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.400]   And so for us, likewise, God has a vision for us
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:54.320]   to be like his son in every single way.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.720]   But if your attitude is just this adversity
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.280]   to people talking about like, hey, you need to grow in this,
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.240]   and like, you know, I'm already doing a good job,
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:04.440]   and you have this wall up where people can't correct you,
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.800]   know that God's intent is to make sure you're growing
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   in every aspect, in every way, to the full measure of Christ.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.840]   And we have to be bought into that
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.640]   because that's what he wants for all of us collectively.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:22.200]   Understand that God desires to create
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.120]   this incredible vision for the church.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.960]   And what he says is in verse 16, he says,
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.440]   "From whom the whole body, everybody,
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.480]   "being fitted together and held together
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.320]   "by what every joint supplies,
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.880]   "according to the proper working of each individual part,
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.360]   "causes the growth of the body
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:45.720]   "for the building up of itself in love."
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:49.120]   So I'm not sure if I could even draw a diagram for that,
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.440]   but every single one of us is drawing from the source
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.200]   that is Christ himself.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.720]   We have one spirit, one baptism, one Lord,
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.040]   one faith in our savior that is producing
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.040]   an incredible power for every single one of us
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.520]   and binding us together.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:07.480]   And we're so one because of that truth of Jesus Christ.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.080]   And yet individually, Christ has given us gifts
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.600]   and blessed us in such ways
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.680]   that we are participants of this build that he's doing
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.480]   to create this, what?
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:21.040]   His incredible home, his loving home.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:25.520]   We're all tied together, interdependent, loving one another.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.960]   And it would bring such joy to the father to see his home.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:33.920]   So actively working, so selflessly working,
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:38.520]   so intentional as he is, that's the idea.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:41.440]   And so I pray, like I pray every single one of us
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.600]   should first get this same vision, like,
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.680]   whoa, like, I don't know about everything
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.680]   that needs to happen in this generation and time now,
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:51.120]   but clearly what I can say that his desire
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.160]   is his church to be built.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.480]   And he has a magnificent, beautiful picture
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.120]   where every single piece is doing its part.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.520]   And every single person is growing
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.160]   into the picture of Christ.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.400]   And then collectively, this is a beautiful home
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.920]   reflecting the glories of Christ together.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.440]   And therefore, what a privilege it is for me
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.560]   to help in that build in any way possible.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.400]   We have to have this attitude, like,
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.720]   in every single way, I wanna grow,
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.320]   in every single way, I wanna do the work of service.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.720]   I don't have to do everything,
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.640]   but I wanna do anything for the church.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.720]   Does that make sense?
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:29.320]   And to me, that is my joy.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.160]   I like doing errands for the church.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.800]   I wanna go out there and pick up something
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.560]   and bring it over here and be like, yes, you know?
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:38.080]   I wanna go out there and fix something
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.520]   and be like, I helped fix this part of the church.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.480]   I wanna go out there and meet that guy who's struggling.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.720]   I wanna go out there and meet that guy
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.080]   who's on the outskirt, why?
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.560]   Because number one, I know it pleases my heavenly Father.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.160]   We're all part of this family.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:53.480]   But number two, I know we're part of this grand picture
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.400]   that Christ has set.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.000]   He's blessed this church for a reason.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.200]   He's given us the truth.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.040]   And he's building something that reflects
[00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.080]   essentially his own nature.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:08.640]   And for me to be able to be a part of that
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:12.320]   and to say I'm contributing, that's so worthwhile.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.640]   And so I pray that you would also have that mentality.
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.000]   Not only are we gonna be doing this together,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.880]   but thankfully so, because it's been our privilege
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.200]   that we can join in this work of building up the church.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.040]   Let's pray.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:30.520]   Heavenly Father, thank you so much, God, again.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.240]   What a grace you've given,
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.720]   what mercies you've granted us in Christ.
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:39.120]   And we recognize, Lord, the truth and ramification
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.000]   of the fact that you save us
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.360]   is that, God, you bring us into your home.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.800]   And what's crazy is, as you are bringing more and more people
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:51.120]   into salvation, what glories are given to you.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.160]   But Father God, you are building, Lord,
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.760]   your household, your people.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.400]   And so, God, we thank you for that.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:01.920]   I do pray that, Lord, our church people, that we ourselves,
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.160]   Father God, would be so inclined
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.560]   to want the same things you want.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:09.800]   Lord, for us to continue to mimic, to follow,
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.880]   and imitate your character,
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.160]   to be more like Christ in every way.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.800]   But what's more, Father God, to have your intent, Lord,
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.200]   to be the evangelist and to actively desire
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.160]   to build this church, the sharing of the gospel.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.560]   And what's more, that in every way
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.720]   that we can encourage each other and spur each other on,
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:29.680]   God, that we would be able to then
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.920]   build each other up in love.
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.600]   And God, joyfully, thankfully, fulfill your design
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.600]   and your intent in this church, Lord.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.840]   We wanna thank you again.
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.640]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.960]   Have a great week, everyone.
