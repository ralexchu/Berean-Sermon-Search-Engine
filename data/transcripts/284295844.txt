[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Well, we're going to start.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Why don't I pray for us, and then we'll get our session started.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for just giving us this opportunity to get away
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   and to focus on what you value, the things that you deem important.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Help us through this time and through this session just to get a better understanding
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   of the world that you created and this world's need for a Savior.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   And I pray, Father, that you would help us really to reflect soberly on just the great
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   heart of mercy and compassion that you have and help us to resemble you through this time.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   We thank you and we pray for your help to navigate through the next however many
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   stories that we've got.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   My name's Peter, and just a brief introduction so you guys can kind of figure out how it
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   is that I ended up doing the job that I did the last six or nine years.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I was an education pastor here at Berean until 2009.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   And Pastor Peter asked us to go to China.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   And in China for that first year, what I wrestled with was this one year is too short.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   We can't do anything really in this one year.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   And so I wrestled so much with, "Shall we stay longer?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Shall we stay longer?"
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And someone asked me, "Well, Peter, do you feel called to China?"
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   And it made me think, and I asked him, "Do you feel called to America?"
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   And then I got my answer for myself.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   The command is to go.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I should be challenged.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   I should really make a confirmation of the call to ever make.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   The command is to go.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And so we stayed there for a year, extended it to three.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   We said, "Well, we need two more years."
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   And in the next two years, I was really burdened with this thought.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Every time we set a date to leave, we're not going to give our hearts into this ministry,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   so we just got to go home.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And I have no passion for China.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I have a vested interest.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   But we just made a commitment, "Okay, we will be here for the rest of our lives until God moves us elsewhere."
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And so that three years turned into a long-term vision.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   But God put on my heart a desire to champion the cause of children.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And so I've been a Compassion International sponsor since 1997.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And I went on a trip to the Philippines with my wife.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Back then, it was a five-year anniversary kind of a trip, and I was blown away.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And Compassion Korea recruited me, so I ended up in Korea.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And what my job was, was a vision trip leader.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And my job was to take anybody and everybody--VIPs, national leaders, church leaders, celebrities, random people, student groups--anybody and everybody.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   If they want to go somewhere, I'm the one who takes them.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Okay, so that was my job.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And so wherever I went, it wasn't that--you know, we weren't staying at, like, the nice resorts and--well, our hotels were nice.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   But we weren't, like, going to hang out at the beach.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   What we were going to do was to visit the slums, visit the trenches, visit the garbage dumpsites.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And so a lot of the stories I've gained over the last six years are all pictures that I've taken.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And I just want to just share with some--review some of the stories that I've gained.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   So in my time at Compassion, I totaled it up.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I was on 279 flights in the five years, four months.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   So that was about 55 flights a year.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And so I had--all the boarding has to have, like, this many.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   So I've seen a lot.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And what I would love to do on an airplane, I usually get the window seat, and I like to watch as the plane goes up.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   But after a while, that gets old.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   But wherever I went to for the first time, I like to watch for the last hour of the descent.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Because you kind of see a bigger picture.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And I usually would--I didn't like to watch movies too much because I felt like it would be a waste of my time.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   So I turned on the Sky Map, and I studied that map.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   And that was one of my favorite things to do.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And I've discovered that this world is not small.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   It's huge.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   So during the course of my job, I visited many, many poor families.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I've eaten ostrich, crocodile, guinea pig, donkey, dog--don't judge me.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I've woken up to monkeys fighting outside my room.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Monkeys doing other stuff outside my room.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   I've woken up to alpacas screaming.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   If you don't know what an alpaca is, just look it up.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   [monkey noises]
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Until I woke up to that.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I've been bitten by mosquitoes in about 17 countries.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And I've visited 162 Compassion Partner Churches all over the world.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   But we have about 6,800 churches that Compassion partners with.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   So I've seen so much, but of all the churches that Compassion works with, I've seen 2%.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   So I've seen a lot, and yet I've learned--or I've seen so little.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   So I've learned a lot about poverty, and one of the greatest lessons I've ever learned
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   through my job was how much I don't know.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Sometimes when someone posts on Facebook, "Christianity is like this,"
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   "Oh, the world is like this," and they've never left Orange County,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   it's kind of--I just feel like, "How arrogant of a statement is that?"
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   You just blanketed it from your tiny little corner of the world.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   But this world is a big place.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   So I'm going to show you how big the world is briefly.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Last week we were in Vancouver, Canada, from LAX to Vancouver.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   It took three hours.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Can you kind of chart LA and Vancouver?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   This is Africa.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   So people I have often seen, "Oh, I hate being in Africa," or "Africa's not nice."
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   They're like, "You know, Africa is bigger than U.S., China, India, Great Britain,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   "Eastern Europe, Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   "Italy, and Japan combined."
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   It takes from one side to the other longer to get across Africa
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   than to go from LAX to Korea.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   So this is a big, stinking continent.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And I've been to probably more countries than most of you have.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I've only seen eight of these countries.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   But this is Africa.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   And Africa is not that big plot of land if you look at it from a much more global perspective.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Broad generalizations are dangerous in Christendom.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   To say that all Christians have to be like this,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   you have to be very careful once you make access outside of what we find in Scripture.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And so what I've discovered is that this world is big.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   But one thing that I've also been heartbroken by is this fact.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   40% of the world's inhabitants struggle to eat just one meal a day.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   So this big plot of land.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   So it took me three hours on a plane to get from LAX to Vancouver,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   and that's just like boink on the map.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   But in this giant world, 40% struggle to eat how many?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   One meal a day.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   I don't know when the last time I've eaten one slice.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   And I mean, not for diet purposes.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   But when we say one meal a day, it's usually no bigger than like this.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   It's a piece of bread.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   So for you, when you hear this number, when you see this number,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   it might not be easy to wrap your mind around, but for me,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   these are the types of people I've met all the time.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   So I'm going to share with you some of their stories.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   There are three things just in all of my traveling and my experiences.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   And again, I share with you, there's so much more I don't know than I do know.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   That's the thing that I feel like is one of the best lessons I've ever learned.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I can't put that in bonds.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   But there are three things that have been reaffirmed for me.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   The first one, our big God created a big world.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   So for you and for me, it's hard to fully grasp this.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   But just know that right now where you're at, your God is too small.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   God is big.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   And I'm going to share with you some stories of people that I've met whom God has created.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Can you guys see this?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   No.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Okay.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Well, just -- there are people there, okay?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   [laughter]
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   This was in Tanzania.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   It's in a country that's part of Eastern Africa.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And -- yeah, I'll wait for everyone to -- let's see how this -- is everybody good?
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   [pause]
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Oh, genius.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   My face is not that important, all right?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   So these are the Maasai.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   And what the Maasai are famous for is two things -- or three things.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   They have lots of kids.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   They have lots of wives.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   The believing is trying.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   And because there's a shortage of water, they bathe in goat milk and they drink in goat milk.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   So their skin is super smooth.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   But there's snow and there's flies everywhere because everything is, like, sticky and mucky.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   But in any case, they have a lot of wives and a lot of children.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   So this is my friend Richard, who is Maasai.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   His father had 21 wives.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Richard grew up with 78 sisters and 48 brothers.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   So I asked him, "Do you know how many nephews and nieces you have?"
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   And he just started laughing.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   He's like, "You cannot count that kind of stuff."
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   But Richard's a Christian.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And he's looked down upon as a Christian because he has already one wife.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   It's a different side of the world.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Here are some of the Maasai children who are part of the Compassion International Sponsorship Program.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   This is a circumcision ritual that we happen to stumble upon.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And in the circumcision ritual, these boys who turn 13, they're put away for a month by themselves.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   And then when they come out, they're a man.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   And so that's a different set of values.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Can anyone tell me what country this is from?
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Any guesses?
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   It's Indonesia.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Indonesia has 34 provinces, and this is the poorest.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   It's an area called Papua.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   It's different from Papua New Guinea.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Papua New Guinea is a country.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Papua is a province.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   And we went up on a mountain area where the Wamena people live.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   And they have a strange tradition of loving pigs.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   And so the Wamena people love pigs so much that when they put their kids to sleep at night,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   the pigs come in and they sleep between the children.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   And then they're sleeping, so they're cush pillows for the kids.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   But a more interesting thing they do is for women who are nursing.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   If they have milk left over, they give it to the pigs.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   I'm going to do that real quick. It's a little inappropriate.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   And we have churches that are ministering to the children, to the poor, there.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   I've never eaten a pig. I don't know how that works.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   But this is a different culture.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And God created this world so big with so many cultures, so many people, tribes, languages, races.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   And our illness is a tiny bit.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   So God created a big world.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   And I've seen a lot of stuff that has broken my heart, that has caused me to weep.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   And the second thing that has been reconfirmed for me is the world really needs Jesus Christ.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   So last year around this time, I was in an area of Togo.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Togo is one of the poorest countries in all of Africa.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Their per capita income is around $400 per person per year.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And so it's very poor.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   And three months out of the year, there's harvest.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   And the ground is not good, but there is some harvest.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Nine months out of the year, there's famine.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   So for three months, you have stuff to eat.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   For nine months, the people in Togo have very little to eat.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Somehow they survive.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   But because 90% of them are farmers, when the land has nothing, they have nothing.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   And that's still okay until one of the kids steps on something or gets bitten by a dog.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Or gets malaria.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   They die because their immune systems are weaker.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   They have no food.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   They also have no money.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   So even if they could drive 11 hours to their closest hospital, they can't pay the hospital bill with a chicken.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   So Togo is very poor.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   And I've seen very emaciated adults, boys and women.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   And these people, I've discovered, really need God to work and bless.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Another area with food shortage is Ecuador.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   And this was taken in a very rural part of Ecuador.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   I don't even remember the name of the area.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   But it's like maybe seven hours outside of Quito, which is the capital.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   And this was a family that ate meat only once a month for protein.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   And the meat that they ate was guinea pig.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   And I tried it.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   This was not the guinea pig that I ate.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   But we ate guinea pig.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   So because they're so poor, Dad has to go to Quito to work for 10 months of the year.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   And a lot of the fathers are not around.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   But that causes a problem socially, functionally.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   A lot of sexual crimes happen.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   And they have no justice.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   They have no money to pay for anything.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   This girl who's 15 on the left, she's pregnant.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   And basically the rest of her life is now devoted to having to take care of this kid.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Mom is uneducated.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   And only two of the kids are in school.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   And that's the thing with poverty.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Most of the world is poor.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   But the poorest of the poor live in the remote, like the farthest rural areas.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   That's why even if you guys go on like a mission trip somewhere, you're not getting to the poorest of the poor.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   You're not seeing the poorest of the poor.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Because to see the poorest of the poor, you have to get on a plane and then travel 40 hours more on boats and in cars and in trucks and jeeps and bouncing like carriages.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   You have to do that.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   But just keep in mind that most of this world is poor and most of the poor are in the rural areas.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   But the thing is, urban areas actually feel more poor.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   When you go to a big city and you smell the stench of people, it feels more poor.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   But the rural areas, there's a lot more hopelessness, desperation, and poverty.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   This is a dump site.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   This is in Togo, actually, again.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   And I'm not sure if you guys know that 15 million people in the world live amongst garbage.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   They live in the garbage.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Because if you collect the recyclables, you can get some money out of it.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   So 15 million people in the world live in these garbage dump sites.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   This is in Bali.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   So when I think of Bali, I don't think of a honeymoon destination.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   I think of one of the world's biggest dump sites.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   And one thing that you should be mindful of, this shouldn't ruin your vacations, but most of your vacation destinations, if you go to a third world country, let's say like places in Indonesia or even Thailand or just...
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   There are dump sites if you just drive a little bit, and there are many children living in these kinds of dump sites.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   There are a few thousand people living here.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   And this is in Bali.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   This is taken in Cebu, Philippines.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   And Cebu is a very wet place.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   It rains a lot.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   But when it rains on all this garbage, what happens?
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Their water rises up.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   And what happens to two three-year-old toddlers?
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   They don't know pollution.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   So what do they do?
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   "Ew, water. Cold."
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   They drink the water, and guess what happens to those kids?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   They get sick.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   And they have diarrhea.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   In non-educated communities, diarrhea is one of the biggest killers of babies.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Because the moms, because they're not educated, they don't think to give water to the child who's having diarrhea, because there's dirty water coming out of the baby, right?
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   But these kids not only just have a lot of diarrhea, they also suffer from a lot of lead poisoning, because they just put their mouth on all kinds of stuff.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   But the biggest tragedy of these dumpsite villages is if the government wants to build, let's say, like a hotel, or a shopping mall, or an apartment complex,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   and they're having a hard time getting the residents out of this area, they will set this place on fire.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   And what happens to all the people inside?
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   A lot of them die.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   But the problem is you're never going to read this on the news, because in the eyes of the government, people who live in these dumpsites, are they people?
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   No. They have no value.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   So it's okay just to burn it, and let it rot.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   So these are things that you and I need to be mindful of, and of how much the world needs Jesus Christ.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   I've met a family.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   James, he's a good-looking kid. He's 15 years old.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   He was 15 then, and now he's probably 17 or 18.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   And mom and dad met in this dumpsite.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   And James was born in this dumpsite.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   And mom and dad actually collect all these recyclables to send their kids to school.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   But the little one right there doesn't like school.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   He refuses to go.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Because, he says, "When I go to school, the kids tease me, saying that I smell."
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   See, poverty is not just about not having enough to eat.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   There are so many different social issues and challenges that arise.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Broken families.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   We were creating God's image, but a lot of my friends who are poor,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   they don't see themselves with as much value as me.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   They see themselves as garbage. Because why?
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   They've spent most of their lives in a garbage dumpsite.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   15 million people live in these dumpsites.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   This was taken in Thailand, toward the north.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   And did you guys notice anything about the map?
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   This is in the church, outside the Sunday school buildings.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   What are on these maps?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Bazookas.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   This area is, at any time, war can break out.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   So just a few miles across the border from Thailand, toward Myanmar,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   there is an area that is not a country.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   It's called the Shan State.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   And it's run by soldiers.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   But the soldiers actually gave us special permission to enter into the Shan State.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   It looks like this.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   A bunch of tea farmers.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Very little education.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   For most of their lives, all they knew was war.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   And in this area, after we went in, we met a bunch of people without limbs.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   At some point, what happened was they stepped on landmines, and they just exploded.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   They're just limbless.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   So we met these people.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   And in August 2015, I met a 20-year-old brother.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   His name is Nasi.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Five years prior to us meeting, his mom died of unknown causes.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   And many of the four, they just died of unknown causes.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   And their causes are not known because they're not dying in the hospital.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Because they don't have the money to go to a hospital.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   And then five days after that, dad died of liver failure.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   So since he was 15, Nasi was taken care of.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   He has three siblings.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   One of whom was a girl.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   She's eight years old in this picture.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   And she has a blood condition, which causes the blood vessels in her --
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   the blood vessels to fill up with air.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   And it causes these little bumps all over her body.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Because of compassion, she actually gets treated for this.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   But they come up all the time.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   And when she crosses the border to go into Thailand to go to school,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   she gets teased by the other kids.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   This world is a very cruel place.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   You think kids are innocent and nice and sweet?
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Kids all over the world, you know one thing that they're experts at?
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Teasing other kids.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   I see again and again that this world really does need Jesus Christ to change thoroughly,
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   to change wholly, to change effectively.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   I've shown you guys -- some of you guys have seen this picture before.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   This is taken in North Korea.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   And I shared with you on a Friday night that these kids are junior high school students.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   And if you actually look up closely to their face, you'll see that they're pubescent kids.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   But their bodies are like this big.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   And I shared with you the thing that broke my heart was hearing that all of these kids have seen a public execution.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And most people, when they hit 20 years old in North Korea at that point, have all seen a public execution.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   And there's spiritual oppression that's rampant in this country.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   And I mentioned the fact that they were abandoned and they basically grew up in this orphanage.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   And in the orphanages, they do get some food, but they're all severely malnourished.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   And when winter comes, a lot of them stay cold for three to four months over the course of the year.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   This is Philippines.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   And you might see this in the Philippines all over the place.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Anywhere there's a small body of water.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   This is Korea 60 years ago.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   And I don't know if you guys noticed or not, but South Korea actually was the second poorest country in the whole world at that time.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Does anyone have a guess as to which was the poorest country in the world in 1952?
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Guinea.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   So South Korea was the second poorest country outside of Guinea about 60 years ago.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   And so they were so poor, Koreans were so poor, that we had so many of the world's largest charity organizations all started in Korea.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   I don't know if you guys knew that or not.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   But if you're a fan of Korean descent, you're here because the world ever is young.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Otherwise Korea would still be super poor.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   And in the regular books of Compassionate International--ah, I wasn't there to take this picture because I wasn't born yet.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   But back then, when they would get a shipment of apples, and each of the kids got two apples in this orphanage,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   they said that was a highlight of the year.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   It's a matter of perspective.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   So with all this oppression and poverty and sin and hurt and pain, what is the answer?
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   What is the cure?
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   What is the hope?
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Is it to pour money into these countries?
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   That's the easy way. That's the instinctive response, right?
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   This is Korea now.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   This is Seoul now.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   But South Korea has the highest suicide rate, one of the highest suicide rates in the world,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   and the highest alcohol consumption rate in the world.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   What does that tell you? Koreans are not happy.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   And the churches--there's a lot of churches and missionaries in Korea,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   but there's something that kind of went around in Korea.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   And the thing that kind of dawned on me was, truly only Jesus can save.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   But when you have the message of the cross and of Jesus Christ going into a people,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   in addition with all these Western values, in addition with the promises of wealth,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   and the health and wealth gospel is actually very effective in preaching to the poor.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   But something happens there is where you damage those people.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   And one thing that I discovered in the poor all over the world,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   the poor are harder working than the rich.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   The poor are more compassionate than the rich.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   The poor are more generous than the rich.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Let me give you an illustration.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   This is a little girl. Her name is Naema. Her name is Grace.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Naema in Swahili means Grace.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   This is actually James and Valerie Lee's compassionate child.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   So back in May of 2015, we were taking--
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   we were doing a photo shoot for the upcoming Christmas,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   and we were traveling all over Tanzania to get just shots of the kids
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   just for our publications and stuff.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   And to get kindergarteners to smile for a camera, it's not easy.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   So we had to bribe them. So we're like, "Ahh!"
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Like, smile and all that stuff. And we gave them each a small pack of Haribo gummy bears.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   You guys know what those are? In Costco, you still are looking at it, right?
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   So little Naema got this bag of Haribo gummy bears.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   And we were just traveling around. I didn't give any thought to this little girl.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   But we went to a home, and we visited with a mom.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   And she had five kids. All five kids were of different fathers.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   And the mom had eight. None of the kids had eight, fortunately,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   but all five kids had eight.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   And little did we know, like, 20 minutes later,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   little Naema would actually walk in through the door.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   And what broke my heart, what, like, shocked me was she still had the pack of gummy bears in her hand.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   And she came into the gate. She opened up this pack of gummy bears,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   gave one to each of the four other siblings,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   gave one each to the two neighbor kids that were watching us white people,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   and then she gave one to her mom, and then she ate one.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   And she ate one of the kids that was five years old.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   And that caused me such shock.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   There's something about the beauty of people who are created in the image of God.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Even though they're in this poor place, they know how to display the attributes of God.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   A lot of what you and I -- may I forgot some --
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   so this five-year-old kid -- I mean, obviously, not all the kids did that,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   but Naema went and she did this.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   And I actually requested that she be enrolled into the Compassionate Program.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   I said, "I will find you a sponsor, and if the whole sponsor is not, I will sponsor this little girl."
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   We already had four, but he -- so I'll pray to God, hope I'm not getting in trouble.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   And then James Vidal puts in the email, he goes, like,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   "Would you recommend any Compassionate Children? I have a perfect one for Tanzania for you."
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   And so this is their child.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   But this is such a common sight when you go to the communities of the poor.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Because they were created in the image of God. God created them.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   So the first thing that I shared that was reconfirmed through all of my traveling was
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   that this world is so big, and God is so big.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   And this big world is badly damaged.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   And sin is everywhere, and everybody needs Jesus Christ.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Rich, poor.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Those who eat more than one pill a day, and those who eat only one pill a day.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Those who have, those who have not. Everybody needs restoration in Jesus Christ.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   That's something that I discovered.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   But now to the good stuff.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   I've seen things in the world that show me how much God loves the poor.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   And how God, through Christ, truly saves.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   And I want to share some stories of the things that God is doing around the world to transform lives.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   This little girl in the middle, she's not little, she's 14 years old.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   Her name is Iyun.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   When she was 12 years old, her parents arranged for her to be married.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   She lives in an area called Java.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   My assumption is that's where we get the coffee stuff.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   But the island area, she's in Java.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   So her parents, who are farmers, they arranged for Iyun to get married at the age of 12.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   Iyun didn't want to do this.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   And she refused.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   And the parents threw her away.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   So they sent her, and this is in Bali.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   They sent her away, and then somehow she ended up in Bali, digging through the trash.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   To find something to eat.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   This church in Bali, which is actually, most of Indonesia is Muslim.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   But Bali, the majority religion is actually Hinduism.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   And so, but this church just adopted this girl.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   So this girl, Iyun, lives in the church.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   And they fed her, they clothed her, they taught her about the goodness of God,
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   they taught her about the dignity of women, they taught her about the need for a savior,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   and she got saved.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   And when we met her, she was telling us that she had accepted Christ,
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   that she was number two at her whole school,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   and that she had been in contact with her parents to forgive them,
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   and to try to mend that relationship with her parents who had thrown her away.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   And that's not something that any just moralistic person could do.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   That requires a change of the heart.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   And in this small church in Bali, God was at work.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   And I met her, I think a year and a half later,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   and she's number three in her class.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   But just a Korean, you might oppose that name.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   I'm not saying you want to, but yeah.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Out of a class of maybe 800, from a girl who was just picking out trash,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Christ truly did change everything about her life.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   I'm going to travel to a different place with you.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   This is in the Philippines.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   This is in the Luzon, the main island.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   And I met this girl, her name is Micah Rose.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Micah Rose was just kind of quiet, shy, kind of a youth kid.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   And she's been a compassionate kid ever since she was six years old.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   But when she was in her last year of high school,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   two boys and their friend, who's a girl, basically they drugged her.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   And in her drugged kind of stupor, the two boys raped her.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   And she said the whole time she couldn't move, she couldn't scream,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   but she could hear them laughing away.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   She could hear the girl laughing away.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   So she went into severe depression after about,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   so for like a year, she took off school.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   She didn't want to have anything to do with anybody.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   And you know, this kind of story is extremely common.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   Because you know the governments,
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   like two billion people in the world actually have no protection under the law of any country.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Usually they're all poor, right?
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   So if a poor person gets raped, they go to the police station.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Sometimes the police will say, "Stop pushing us on this,"
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   or something worse will happen to you.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   So actually police tell them to stop bothering us or you're going to get hurt.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   So Micah obviously fell into depression.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   But this is one of the reasons I love Compassion International.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   Compassion International, if you sponsor a child, it goes all the way.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   The compassion goes all the way.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   I keep saying we, because I'm so used to saying we,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   but I'm not that compassionate when I'm on brain computers.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   They hired lawyers from IGN who put both of those boys into jail.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   But one of those boys is actually getting out in the next two months.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   And the last time I talked to her, she said it's okay that those boys are getting out,
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   or one of those boys is getting out,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   because maybe that will give me an opportunity to be shared with the rest of them.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Because what compassion did for this little girl was not just fight for her justice,
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   not just vindicate her,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   but for all four years of university they paid for it.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   And they paid for all the counseling that she had to go through.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   And she was crème de la crème.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   She was one of the best students in all of her class.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   And she graduated last March, because March is when the school year ends in the Philippines.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   And now she started her first year in law school.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   She wants to become a lawyer to protect women who are abused,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   and protect women who don't have compassion and compassion behind them,
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   to fight for them.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   And the thing that just jacked me up was this.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   She said, "You know, I am thankful for compassion more than anything else,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   because compassion taught me about Jesus Christ."
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   "Compassion could have clothed me, given me multivitamins,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   given me vaccinations, checked my teeth, checked my eyes,
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   sent me to school, paid for all of my books,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   and your sponsorship actually does all this."
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   "Do a criminal prosecution on my behalf, compassion could have done all that."
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   "The one thing it would never be able to do is make me forget those boys laughing."
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   "And one thing it could never do is cause me to forget you."
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   "Only Jesus could do that."
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   That's why any kind of mission is endeavor without Christ.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   You're just fixing the surface, and the heart will still pour.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   My girl, what she said was, "Because Christ changed my heart,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   and taught me to forgive, how can I not forgive that boy?"
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   She was wrestling with all the, "Am I ever going to get married?
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   What person is going to love me?"
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   But this kind of story is also very common.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Because when Jesus saves, He doesn't just save for like,
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   "Oh, okay, I raised my hand at a church, I have assurance of salvation."
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   He teaches people who have been extremely damaged to repay with love and forgiveness.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   But this isn't just happening solely in the churches of the poor.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   I want to share with you, this family is very happy, right?
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   The little girl with the red hat, her name is Lucy.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   Lucy is the youngest of eight children.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   When mom was pregnant with baby number eight, dad ran away.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   At first you're like, "Dude, those men, men in the world are everywhere.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   They're the sick, those jerks, they'll leave the world."
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Before you say that, this man actually stayed from one through seven.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   He was working in the fields, just doing two, three jobs to take care of his kids.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   But when number eight came along, I guess something snapped and he just went away.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   So Lucy's mom was doing manual labor to try to figure out how to get food into their kids' bellies.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   Because she was in such a desperate need, she was enrolled in the church,
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   into the Child Survival Program.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   But even still, what happened was, as mom was working, all of a sudden she had major pain.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   So she had to go to the hospital.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   She had to have an emergency C-section.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   But after the C-section, the next day she went back out to work because she said her kids needed to eat.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   So she went back.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   And two and a half years after that surgery, after Lucy was born, actually that's when we met her,
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   she said she was still having pains.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   But that little lady holding the camera there was so broken by this story
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   that she kept bugging me, she was harassing me to like, "I want to do this, I want to do that for this family."
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   So she actually said, we got an estimate of, okay, for Lucy's mom to go back into school,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   to get some kind of a training, how much would that cost?
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   And the estimate came out to about $3,200 for the year to feed all eight kids.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   Well, the younger six, the older two, they were gone.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   But to feed the kids, what would they need?
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   So the lady in this park, she set the $3,200.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   Mom went to school for the full year with the accountability of the church.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   And now she's working at a beauty salon, making 11 times more than she did before.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   That was not possible just from the Pennsylvania church alone.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   That was not something that compassion would have initiated because we have so many poor kids.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   But someone from the Korean church saw the need, was broken, and was grieved,
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   shared what she had, and she basically allowed this mom to have dignity,
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   to make her own money to feed her kids.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   And you know what her prayer is?
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   I can't find my husband, but I want to tell him about Jesus.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   I want to share about the Lord.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   These are the kinds of things that are going on all over the world.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   The poor, they're not going to get rich by us helping them.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   But something happens when Jesus Christ enters into a person and does some major cleanup work,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   does some major healing of scars and of wounds, a person is changed.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   And that's something that's a little harder to see because there's poverty all over us as well.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   Would you guys agree with that?
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   I'm not talking about homeless in Santa Ana.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   Spiritual poverty is a little bit harder to gauge.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   But we are not as broken over spiritual poverty as to the physical poverty, right?
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   But if we were broken over people's spiritual poverty around us,
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   and we were trying to figure out what's the best way to not bad-message a person by trying to help them,
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   what's the best way to lift them up in dignity, to follow the Lord,
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   I think there would be a lot more revival.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   And that's something that I want to share with you is the more I study scriptures,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   the opposite of poor is not rich.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   The opposite of poor is not rich.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   The opposite of poor is enough.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   And as you go farther and farther away from enough, whether it's this way or it's this way,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   spiritual poverty just latches on and causes someone's tender heart to be weighed down by unnecessary things,
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   by the evils of the world, and causes someone who was created in the image of God with dignity to turn and be oppressed.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   Something to be mindful of.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   This is Sri Lanka, an area very far away.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   And I share a story in my sermon that I went to an area where the elephants just not found a building.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   This is completely in the opposite direction, up in the north, up in the mountains.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   This was a different trip.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   But Sri Lanka is a very poor country.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   There's a lot of alcoholics.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   All the tea farmers, they're drinkers.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   And even the women drink.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   And they make their own alcohol.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   And they make their own wine and drink.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   And homemade alcohol is actually very potent.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   Or so I hear.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   I don't know.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   I don't know.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   Okay?
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   But this family, basically, this child was enrolled into a compassion program.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   And if you guys don't know anything about Compassion International, Compassion International only works with the local church.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   And so, basically, that kid is taken in and gets his physical, emotional, like, cognitive, all of those needs are met.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   But it's all done through the church.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   So the parents obviously can't help but to be open to actually send a clinic to the church to receive the benefit.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   Mom found Christ through the Bible study.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   And then the husband who used to beat her went the next week to the Bible study with her.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   Committed his life to Christ.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   And the dad who used to spend all of his extra money on liquor, this is a year and a half in to build a new house.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   If you look at the inside, it's nice and decorated.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   Because the father, having met Christ, started taking responsibility of the home.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   This is the kind of stuff that's happening all over the world.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   And I think a lot of broken homes, when you have a weak dad, my assumption usually is that dad has not met Christ.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   Even if you go church.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   But when a man of the house actually stands firm in the Lord, the whole house atmosphere is changed.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   And that's something that I've experienced.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   I have one more story.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   And then we're going to wrap it up.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   We've been talking a lot about India from our church, right?
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   And there's a lot of pain in India.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   14 million people are slaves.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   Current slavery, slavery still exists.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   14 million people are enslaved.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   There's a lot of oppression, there's a lot of persecution.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   There's a lot of illiteracy. I went to a village with 100% illiteracy.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   And something about India, for me, that I will never forget, is that God loves this place.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   That's this feeling I got.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   And in one of the villages, I don't even know what some of the names of these places are, but I met a girl, her name was Manasa.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   And at 13 years old, Manasa started to have a major headache.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   And it just started hurting her so much, actually, the Compassion Programme.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   So if you have a Compassion Sponsor, and your kid gets hurt or gets sick, 100% of the medical bills are covered.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   Through your sponsorship.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   So she traveled 400 kilometers away to Bangalore, India, where the best brain hospital is.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   And x-rays showed that she had a 5/7 tumor in her brain.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   And when Manasa's parents saw this, they were devout Hindus.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   When they saw this, they were just broken. They were weeping.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   They were like, "What did we do to have our daughter suffer like this?"
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   So they were very broken, and they wept in anger.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   And they screamed, "If God, you are real," they screamed at him.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   "Do something, God."
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   But again, Compassion, that kid gets the best possible treatment we can get them.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   So a fund was implemented for this child.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   And so the decision was made to operate and take out the 5/7 tumor.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   And they gave her a 10% success rate.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   So it's like, she's not going to be done.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   It's a 10% chance of success for this girl.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   And even if the surgery is successful, she's for sure going to be mentally impaired.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   So the parents obviously were distraught, and they were weeping, and they were like, "We will take care of her.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   Let's go through the surgery."
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   But just before the doctor initiated the surgery, the doctor felt like doing an angiography.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   I don't know what that is.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   But from what I heard, it was just like, "Do you want to do another scan?"
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   The doctor just felt very uncomfortable.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   And this is a renowned surgeon.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   He's like, "Okay, let's do it."
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   But he's like, "You know what, let's just check it one more time to just reconfirm where everything is."
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   But that pretty new doctor was completely surprised to see through the angiography that the swelling had disappeared completely.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   The surgery was set for April 3, 2012.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   But that morning, that was gone.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   And we found out that that whole couple weeks, everybody was praying for Vanessa and her family.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   Spontaneous closure of the bacilar trunk 9 years in.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   So no one actually went to that she was done.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   So all this money was collected, all the things were prepared, all the equipment was prepared.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   But God took that tumor away.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   But the funnier thing was, look what happens after.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   When all the other patients in that ward of the hospital came to know what happened to Vanessa,
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   all the patients asked Vanessa to pray for them also.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   So Vanessa prayed for every patient to share the gospel with them.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   Vanessa was highly certain in her faith, and so on April 4, 2012, Vanessa was discharged, taken back home.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   And she went back and was totally in person.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   She went and testified among the progeny children about what the Lord had done in their lives.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   All the children in tears prayed, "God, be close to the Lord."
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   Also Vanessa's neighbors came to know about the miracle's healing.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   And they all came to see her at her home.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   And Vanessa and her parents boldly shared with all of them about what Jesus had done in their lives to share the gospel to them.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   This is happening all over the world in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   When Jesus saves and heals, He saves and heals completely and thoroughly.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   And there's a picture of her just sharing her testimony in front of the compassionate children.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   There were 512 compassionate kids at this church.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   And do you think those children believe in the power of prayer?
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   And you know those children, one of the first people that they pray for every day is their sponsors.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   That's a shameless plug for sponsoring a compassionate child.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   I'm into prayers.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   You can come to prayers and they get privileged.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   You know, actually I have a story.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   I have four compassionate children.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   Three of them in the Philippines.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   I got to tell them personally that God answered their prayers and that He was pregnant, not just with one of the two kids.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   And they just cried.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   They prayed.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   To wrap up.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   What do we all have in common?
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   One, not all of us had a choice to where he was born.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   You're enjoying your life here because you were born in very suitable situations and very advantageous situations.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   You are living in one of the most nicest places to live in all of the world.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   And you didn't choose it.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   That's something to keep in mind.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   The second thing that we all have in common is we all need Jesus.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   We need to be saved wholly.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   That's why a lot of people tell me to stop talking.
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   We all need Jesus.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   And those are the things that we have in common.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   No matter where you're born.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   And we all, and what God is desiring for is worshippers from every tribe, nation, language, tongue.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   Every place God is raising up people who will worship Him as holy.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   I'm going to just end with one video.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   In one of the most hostile, drug and prostitution ridden areas in all of the, in Cebu, in the Philippines.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   Sex trafficking, drug trafficking, so much of that.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   Where it's rampant.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   And I want to show you how a church, in the love of Jesus, with the love of Jesus Christ,
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   loved a lot the women in their church.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   And how they changed.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   [Music]
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   [Music]
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   [Music]
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   [Music]
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   [Music]
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   [Music]
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   [Music]
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   [Music]
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   [Music]
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   [Music]
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   [Music]
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   [Music]
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   I sing...
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   'Twas grace that taught...
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   my heart to fear...
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   and raised my fears to fear...
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   I'm gracious in...
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   Thy grace to me...
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   and now I've learned to be...
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   When my shame's all gone...
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   I'll be set free...
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   But God the Savior...
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   is running somewhere...
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   And I don't know...
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   what the secret is...
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   of the delight...
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   of His grace...
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   For I was a girl...
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   to learn His word...
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   by the full secure...
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   Healing my sin...
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   and promotion...
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   As a girl...
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   as a bride...
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   in the groom...
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   When my shame's all gone...
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   I'll be set free...
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   But God the Savior...
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   is running somewhere...
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   And I don't know...
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   what the secret is...
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   of the delight...
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   of His grace...
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   When my shame's all gone...
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   I'll be set free...
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   Now, the lady at the end...
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   She was trafficked as a child.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   And then the person who rescued her, her husband...
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   got her into drugs.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   And she was so drug addicted...
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.000]   that she gave birth to a baby with a severe drug addiction.
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   The church just loved on her.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   Now, she's the one who discipled at least 40 moms with their babies.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   And she has a heart of empathy...
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   like someone like me could never have.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   Everything that they've gone through, she would know.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   And I think God raises up people and allows for different points of hurt.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:34.000]   So we can empathize with people in this broken world that are hurting.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   Then we would genuinely have compassion on people.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   When admissions field...
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   and when poverty and stuff remains at a number level...
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   it's not going to stir your heart.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   But when poverty and admissions field start becoming people that you met...
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   people that you know...
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   they become your people.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   It changes your approach to that person.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   Right?
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   And I believe with all my heart that God wants to use every person in this room...
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   to wholly bring the gospel of Jesus Christ...
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   to people all over the world.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   So hopefully...
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   I feel like I was the first one...
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   I took out like 13 stories, okay?
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   Hopefully you had a very brief trip around the world.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   And it was all scattered because, you know, it's stories.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   But hopefully it gave you a little bit of a glimpse of the broken world that we live in.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   The world outside of Southern California.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   And may the God of the nations stir your heart for the nations.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   Starting with the United States of America.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   Amen?
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   Let's pray.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   Thank you for your attention.
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   Let's pray.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   I just want to thank you for...
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   just your love for us.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   And help us not to be spoiled brats that just take in all the love...
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000]   and think that it's given just for us to enjoy.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   But help us to be people who live with a passion...
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   to share your gospel.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   To shine your light into the darkest premises of the world.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   We thank you Lord for this church.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   That any social justice and mission is endeavor does not...
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   substitute proper worship and proper reading of your word.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   So we pray that as you raise up people who are biblically literate...
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   that you would raise up people who have a passion, God, to see the lost come to Christ.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   And the hurting come to healing.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   And the broken come to wholeness.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   We thank you Father for just accepting and praising you Jesus.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   Thank you.
