[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Let me turn to Leviticus chapter 8 and 9.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.880]   All right so chapter 8, 9, and 10 really should be one unit as we said because the topic is
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.960]   very similar.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:34.000]   Chapter 8 is about the institution or the instructions on the dedication of the tabernacle
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.480]   and the priest and then chapter 9 basically is the carrying that out is the sacrifices
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.040]   and cleansing of the tabernacle and then chapter 10 is when they actually begin to implement
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.380]   it when they start to actually give the sacrifices and we know what happens in chapter 10.
[00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:59.600]   But today we're going to just look at chapter 8 and verse 9 and we'll get to chapter 10
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.640]   not next Sunday because next week we have Passion Week and so those of you who signed
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.940]   up for the Passover meal will be having it on Thursday but we don't have normal Bible
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.480]   study week next week because of that.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.760]   So let me pray for us and we'll jump right in.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:22.000]   Heavenly Father we ask for your blessing over our time.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.600]   Help us to understand your word deeply, the foundation Lord God in which the Gospels were
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.320]   laid, the preparation for the coming of Christ, the preparation of our own hearts Lord God
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.240]   as we offer it up to you.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.040]   I pray that you would bless our time that you would allow your word to be made known
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.200]   that we would know you, your heart Lord God and all that you've given in Jesus name we
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.200]   pray amen.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.880]   All right so let's jump right in.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.480]   So today is going to be the ordination of the priest and also the preparation of the
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.480]   tabernacle.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.920]   So up to this point all these instructions have been given and these are the sacrifices
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.120]   that you ought to give so they've given all these instructions but the priest who are
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.960]   supposed to carry this out hasn't been ordained yet so up to this point all of this is just
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.960]   instruction they've been reading the manual and they're about to start implementing it
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.320]   and so but before they do that the priest and the tabernacle itself needed to be sanctified
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.080]   need to be purified because if everything if all the sacrifices that they're giving
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.920]   is for the sanctification and justification of the worshippers the temple itself the tabernacle
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.680]   itself and the priest who are going to handle these holy items they also need to be sanctified
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.520]   so that's what they're doing today in verse 8 chapter 8 and 9 is preparation before the
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.840]   actual thing starts you'll notice that if you've been if you've read through these two
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.680]   chapters maybe three chapters that the phrase as the Lord commanded is repeated over and
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.400]   over again so all the verses that I mentioned here chapter 4 chapter 8 verse 4 5 9 13 17
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:05.940]   21 29 34 36 chapter 9 verse 6 7 10 21 and then the word the general word for command
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.920]   is mentioned 20 times in chapter 8 9 and 10 so obviously the word commanded or the Lord
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.720]   commanded is a is a common phrase that you'll see all throughout scripture but it's concentrated
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.360]   in these three particular chapters right so of course everything that he has done is because
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.560]   God commanded them to do it but there's a special emphasis in chapter 8 9 and 10 that
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.640]   that what they're about to do that they're about they're about to follow precisely he
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.960]   didn't give a general outline of hey when you come make sure you bring these sacrifices
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.680]   but where you do it how you do it who does it you know what to cut up what to eat like
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.080]   he was so precise and that's part of the reason why we get lost in the book of Leviticus because
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.800]   his laws are so precise and so detailed that you might read a couple lines and say well
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.440]   I don't understand this and then you just kind of like okay I'm not gonna understand
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.440]   any of it but there's a purpose behind all of this they wanted the Israelites and us
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:14.760]   reading it to know that the approaching God had to be done exactly so even to the smallest
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.600]   details of the consecration of the temple ordination the priest were carried out in
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:30.760]   to the exact instruction given by God I mean exactly right so why was this important and
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.760]   how do we see the ramification of this in chapter 10 which we're going to be studying
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:44.480]   next time how important is it that they follow exactly what God said not generally not a
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:54.440]   minus right not 99% they needed to follow 100% exactly the way God told them to do it
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.480]   and what was the ramification of it in chapter 10 some of you guys who knows what happens
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:10.040]   in chapter 10 right so the very first act of sacrifice that was supposed to take place
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.780]   in chapter 10 so chapter 8 is preparation right of the of the priest or the instructions
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.560]   chapter 9 they start giving the sacrifices for the priest to get ordained then after
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.920]   they get ordained and then they begin to practice in chapter 10 and immediately the very first
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.720]   thing that happens is they die and basically all it says was they didn't follow the command
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.040]   so there's a heavy emphasis in chapter 8 and 9 that if you do not follow the command of
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.000]   God you cannot come to God if you come to God with breaking any one of these commands
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.200]   you shall surely die and that's exactly what happens in chapter 10 so the prescription
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:54.920]   or the instructions on how to come to God was not vague at all it was like step one
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.320]   step two there's like 200 separate steps that they needed to go and every single one of
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.640]   them had to be done exactly the way God planned to do it and it wasn't simply because he wanted
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:09.400]   to see he wanted to see you know like if you're gonna jump through the hoops and go through
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.160]   all every one of these things had significance and meaning so what do you think the general
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.760]   instruction was and general understanding of the Israelites were don't turn from his
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.560]   word to the left or to the right right and that's exactly what he says later on in Joshua
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:36.560]   1 8 and 9 so you understand this in the context of what he says here okay Joshua 1 8 and 9
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.800]   is right before they enter into the promised land this is after he's given the instruction
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.800]   the blessings and curses and tabernacle is set up and they've been you know they've been
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:53.080]   sacrificing for 40 years so basically for 40 years what were they learning to do this
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.400]   what you what you and I have been studying we're only in chapter 10 but 27 chapters of
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:05.560]   instructions this is just at the tabernacle there's a whole different set of rules on
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.720]   what they're supposed to do outside of the tabernacle what they're supposed to eat what
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.480]   they cannot eat what to do on Sabbath what they cannot do on Sabbath and what is clean
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.760]   what is unclean how to wash themselves I mean there's instruction after instruction so for
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:27.960]   40 years right for 40 years they were to pay attention to God's law precisely and if they
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:34.600]   don't the lesson in chapter 10 was that they die so right before they get into the promised
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.480]   land he says this book of law shall not depart from you but you shall meditate on day and
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:44.300]   night so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it so if you really
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:49.560]   understand Israel's history when he says to be careful they didn't read it like the way
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.040]   we read it it's like oh I want to be careful we don't want to memorize it we don't want
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.000]   to get the prepositions wrong you know I want to make sure we want to be Bible centered
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.640]   we're quoting scripture we're expository preaching when they said careful the consequence of
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:09.680]   not being careful meant capital punishment it was that serious be careful to do all that
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.000]   is written in it for then you will make your way prosperous and then you will have to get
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.520]   success so if you want to be successful in in any way do exactly as I tell you have I
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.840]   not commanded you be strong and courageous do not be frightened and do not be dismayed
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.160]   for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go in other words he says if you do exactly
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.180]   as I tell you you will live if you stray from it and you're not careful to to obey what
[00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:37.520]   I say you shall die right so they would have read this encouragement challenge and warning
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:44.300]   very differently than the way you and I because they experienced 40 years now in the 40 years
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:51.160]   were they careful to do according to all that's written in it there were periods of yes and
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:58.260]   periods of no and exactly as God said when they obeyed they lived when they didn't obey
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:04.040]   they died that's what they learned for 40 years right for 40 years that's what they
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:12.160]   learned so what he's instructing here trust me when the Israelites read this they'd never
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:17.160]   glazed over any part of this they didn't say ah this is too hard and then they go to chapter
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.240]   10 like give me give me some story that I can latch on to you know if your life dependent
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:29.020]   on it which it did for them I guarantee you they studied this they memorized it they meditated
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:35.120]   on it they said it to each other and you can see why by the time we get to the New Testament
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:42.840]   that the Pharisees were so concerned about obeying the law right just think think of
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:48.480]   it as a Jew and you say oh these Pharisees are legalistic you can understand why they
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.920]   were legalistic because God told them if you want to live obey everything I have commanded
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:10:00.520]   you carefully and we can also understand when Paul says in Romans chapter 1 through 11 that
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.600]   we're no longer under the law the law was only given to us as a guardian to bring us
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:11.240]   to Christ why they had such a hard time letting go because for generation after generation
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:16.920]   after generation this was embedded into their psyche their culture their sacrifice their
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:23.240]   worship their singing their Bible studies right is that if you obey you will live if
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:33.200]   you disobey you shall die every single part of what he says okay the reason why this was
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.440]   so important why they needed to practice this and practice this so carefully is described
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:45.760]   for us in Exodus chapter 29 43 to 46 okay in Exodus chapter 29 43 to 46 says therefore
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.080]   I will meet with the people of Israel and it shall be sanctified by my glory and I will
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.440]   consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar Aaron also and his sons and I will consecrate
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:59.600]   to serve me as priest I will dwell among the people of Israel and we be will be their God
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.160]   they shall know that I am the Lord their God who brought them out of the land of Egypt
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:10.400]   that I might dwell among them I am the Lord their God all of this was prescribed in order
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.920]   for the Holy God to be able to dwell among his people I would remember that was the whole
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.760]   theme the book of Exodus where the glory of God is up on the mountain giving his law he
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:25.680]   tells them to make a tabernacle because his intention is to come down so after he establishes
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:31.240]   tabernacle what happens in the book of Numbers he invites them to come right Exodus he says
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:39.160]   don't come Leviticus he says I'm about to come so prepare yourself he prepares and they
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.040]   consecrate and then he comes and he says now and then he invites us to come in the book
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.920]   of Numbers okay before we even move on the whole purpose of all of this is described
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:55.200]   here he said I'm doing all of this because a holy God if I come in your natural state
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:03.080]   you will die you can't exist with a holy God just by him opening up his his glory for you
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:08.320]   to see any sinful man who has not been consecrated and didn't follow every every precept of the
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:15.520]   law would have immediately died right now again obviously you know the blood of Christ
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:22.120]   covers us but there was a reason why God wanted every one of the Israelites to pay very close
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:29.400]   attention to the law of God because every part of it revealed who he is and it revealed
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:36.600]   to him so that when they come they would come with a sense of reverence and awe right again
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:42.600]   I think that the tragedy that we have in today's Christianity is people don't know the Word
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.200]   of God and when we say people don't know the Word of God it's just another way of saying
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.460]   they don't know God I don't care how much you heard about God from the pulpit or how
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:56.640]   you grew up in the church and went to Sunday school all your life and if you don't know
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.160]   what the Word of God if you're not intimately in the Word of God you don't know God because
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:09.040]   God is in his Word he says all scripture is breathed out by God right meaning his very
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:16.320]   spirit is in his Word and so in the Old Testament his nature and his character was revealed
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:22.280]   in the law in the New Testament his nature and his character the law led us to Christ
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:27.560]   but the but the words of Christ is in the gospel and I'm not just talking about you
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.400]   know the book of Matthew Mark Luke and John I'm talking about the whole gamut of the meaning
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:36.840]   of the gospel everything that we've been studying the book of Romans and on is his nature is
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:43.080]   contained in the very intricate details of why the gospel was necessary what the gospel
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.880]   accomplished who did the gospel bring us to how was the gate open how are we to have access
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.320]   to it how are we to continue to have relationship what is the gospel established in the church
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:57.920]   what does a gospel community look like every aspect of the New Testament is a revelation
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.800]   of God and his nature and who he is so you can't have a personal relationship God if
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:08.840]   you have a very loose understanding of God's Word because that's where he revealed himself
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:14.600]   so the point of all of this was for the purpose of consecration to reveal himself so that
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:23.760]   he can dwell among sinful people so chapter 8 verses 1 through 36 it's it's about the
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:30.360]   consecration of his of Aaron and his sons right 1 and 1 through 9 is the anointing of
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:36.560]   his of Aaron and his sons so the anointing was done in the assembly of all the congregation
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:42.520]   this was not done in private because Aaron and his sons were to represent all of Israel
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:48.520]   so all of Israel needed to know that these people were not just anybody who just walked
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:55.120]   into the tabernacle these were specially anointed remember the meaning of the word holy one
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:01.200]   is to be morally holy and what's the other one to be set apart so the the whole of Israel
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.400]   needed to know that these people were not just average people these people were specifically
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.960]   consecrated just like all the other holy items that they were God was going to use them so
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:15.160]   if anybody who came into the tabernacle touch the holy articles of God what happened to
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:21.880]   them they were guilty of sin right only the priests were allowed to do that because they
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.920]   were separated and it was made holy specifically for that and the whole congregation needed
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:32.280]   to know this again no different in the New Testament we see again I'm not going to read
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:39.040]   it but acts 13 1 to 3 when Apostle Paul is chosen to preach the gospel to the Gentiles
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.960]   he doesn't just pluck him out of nowhere and all of a sudden he appears God does save him
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:49.480]   miraculously but he was actually sent out from the church of Antioch the elders receive
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.600]   instructions from the Holy Spirit to set him in Barnabas apart so they pray for him so
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.200]   it was very public so he was actually ordained by this church was sent and then he would
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.920]   go and come back report to this church so even Paul's ministry was not done in isolation
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:09.240]   we saw in first Timothy 5 22 25 you know the way that people come into ministry today is
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.760]   they get convicted I want to go they go to seminary they become a pastor and a lot of
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.440]   times the church hasn't church doesn't play any part in that other than they come to want
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.760]   to lead the church one day well the way that the Bible prescribes somebody coming into
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:27.920]   leadership in the church he tells Timothy to not to be hasty and laying hands in other
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:34.000]   words not to not to ordain that person hastily because if you do it hastily is that you participate
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.060]   in that person's sin so somebody coming into ministry was never meant to be somebody who
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.060]   just kind of stands up and say you know what I'm convicted I'm gonna go and then you go
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:47.280]   to a seminary and you become a pastor right and there's a reason why he tells Timothy
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.320]   to be careful because some men sins are obvious and some men sins trail behind them in other
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:57.040]   words the church needs to test them it needs to be public right and that's why the scripture
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:03.440]   says when a when a leader sins there is no there's there isn't this process of one two
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.600]   and try to restore them it's as if the leader sins is that it's automatically public right
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.960]   it needs to be dealt publicly so that the sin is revealed to the whole church so there's
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:18.240]   a seriousness of those people in specifically in the Old Testament and the New Testament
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:23.720]   where there's a weightiness of the work of the ministry and so that's what's being prescribed
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:30.720]   here in chapter 8 there's an anointing that takes place it's taking place publicly because
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:38.120]   because of what they were called to do their anointing first begins with ritual washing
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:47.240]   so basically they're they're bathing followed by the putting on of the priestly uniform
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:55.800]   now again there's significance of all of this the priests were uh ceremony of bathed once
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:01.880]   and after that only washed their hands and feet while they served in the tabernacle does
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:07.960]   that sound similar to familiar to you Jesus does the exact same thing remember remember
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:19.880]   where does this take place in John chapter 13 what scene is that in John chapter 13 it's
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.400]   at the Passover meal right when Jesus he bends down he's washing their feet and then Peter
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:29.240]   says you know you're my master I can you can't do that remember what Jesus says said if you
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:34.120]   do not let me wash you I have no relationship with you and typical Peter fashion well if
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.360]   that's the case you know wash my whole body and Jesus says he who has bathed does not
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:42.000]   need to bathe again right but because you walk the search you have to wash your feet
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.560]   regularly right where do you think that concept came from it wasn't just out of nowhere this
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:53.520]   was part of the teaching in the in the Old Testament that the that the priests who are
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.360]   being ordained for ministry that they bathe when they were initially consecrated but they
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.800]   have to continually go over these this washing of hands and feet in order for them to be
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:11.320]   able to to do their ministry right so basically it kind of symbolizes repentance in one person
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:17.720]   a person who has been who has repented does not need to be resaved over and over again
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:23.080]   but he does need to confess his sins and receive forgiveness over and over again that again
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:29.600]   so that idea that concept it was embedded in the Old Testament law the way that the
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:38.440]   priests were sanctified the uniforms you know if you read through and you say well all these
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:43.080]   tiny little details I'm not going to remember all of it and we probably won't but the uniforms
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:48.860]   are usually used to distinguish the office of function of a person right and the splendor
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:55.160]   of the office is also distinguished by the splendor of the uniform so think about I mean
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:03.360]   think about what profession and for what purpose uniforms are used in in modern-day usage I
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:09.080]   mean you could probably think of like officers police officers they wear a uniform right
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:19.360]   in fact it's actually illegal to impersonate an officer right who else wears uniforms going
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:31.360]   blank soldiers right soldiers wear uniforms doctors right at the hospital they wear uniforms
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:43.400]   so why do they wear uniforms right to set them apart for what purpose because of the
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:49.960]   work that they're doing right so because they say as an officer an officer shows up and
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:54.160]   he's in plain clothing you know he doesn't he doesn't he isn't given the same kind of
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:21:00.320]   authority because he's in his uniform we recognize his authority so when he speaks with authority
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:05.660]   that uniform helps right because he represents not just himself he represents the authority
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.600]   of the government and there are certain things that he can do that a normal person cannot
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:14.840]   do and so he wears a uniform for that purpose in the army they wear uniform obviously for
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:20.920]   the purpose of identifying them with civilians versus those who are soldiers so in in the
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:30.440]   army do they do they all wear the same uniform no based on ranking they have different stripes
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:38.080]   right different whatever it is you call it right and so usually the higher the rank usually
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:43.320]   the the the unifier at least the formal uniform not in battle the formal uniform they wear
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:48.840]   is a little bit more elaborate you know you don't have you don't have privates walking
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.840]   around with diadems and things flowing all over and then the general walking around and
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:22:00.480]   you know in in sweatpants usually the higher the rank the more presentation more glorious
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.680]   is the uniform right and so that's what we see here where the first thing that happens
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.400]   is they go through ritual cleansing and then there is a special guard that they put on
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:16.080]   them to distinguish them from the unholy and holy from the common and the uncommon because
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:22.040]   they are being separated from lay people because they're touching holy things and they represent
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:26.520]   the things of God they needed to be ordained in that purpose so even within the priest
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:33.160]   there was the garment was different between who the high priest and the low priest high
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.320]   priest and then the regular priest right so the high priest garment was very elaborate
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:41.640]   I think I might have a there you go that's the high priest and that's a regular priest
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.440]   in fact the regular priest garment is usually was usually a lot more plain than that didn't
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.880]   have any color like that one has right in fact I don't even think that's the regular
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:56.480]   priest that that's what the probably the high priest had underneath all that other stuff
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:02.240]   but I couldn't find pictures side by side but you just you know what I'm doing right
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:08.480]   so the high priest garment was very elaborate right and he had a special thing on his head
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:12.440]   he had a breast piece and he had all these different things that he wore so when a high
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:19.760]   priest walked into the temple or to do any kind of service people would immediately be
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.440]   able to notice that and not just not just him obviously any priest walk in to do the
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:30.080]   work the people needed to recognize that someone who was set apart for this work has come so
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:36.080]   they just kind of you know allow him to take lead and so that's what the the holy garments
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:44.080]   were for okay Aaron's garments are first described again in great splendor compared to the other
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.280]   priest the high priest garment drew attention to supreme dignity and holiness of the special
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:24:03.080]   office Urim and Thummim literally means lights and perfection I was kind of debating whether
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:10.000]   I should even share this with you today because I didn't want to get sidetracked but so many
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.560]   people are confused about what it is and so I thought it'd be you know it it doesn't add
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:21.040]   to the main teaching of their garment but I think for your curiosity I wanted to mention
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.560]   it the word literally means lights and perfection and the reason why they didn't translate it
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:31.320]   lights and perfection is because they don't exactly know like what the function was they
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:36.960]   don't know exactly so they just kept it in Hebrew so the literal Hebrew words Urim and
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:43.400]   Thummim and most scholars believe that they believe that it was some sort of holy lots
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:49.800]   right and whether it was a dice or whether it was whatever configuration it was the high
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:56.720]   priest or the priest the priest kept it in one of his side pockets and it was kind of
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:06.160]   like remember the book of Acts I think I have the book of Acts here all right though okay
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:12.960]   so remember in the book of Acts chapter 1 12 to 26 right what happens there Acts Acts
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:28.680]   chapter 1 12 to 26 they're trying to replace Judas as the 12th disciple right I thought
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.720]   I had the text here why don't you turn your Bibles to Acts chapter 1 and we're getting
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:38.680]   a little bit sidetracked but I think this is so many people have asked me this question
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:43.800]   I thought it'd be helpful for at least to touch upon it for a little bit so if you look
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:50.000]   at Acts chapter 1 12 to 26 this is where they choose to replace Judas and then they have
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.880]   a criteria that this man was going to do something very important they're going to replace the
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:01.820]   12 disciple and the 12 men are going to be co-rulers with Christ in eternity in the kingdom
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:07.520]   of God and so this was not just some random position this was going to be a very important
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.720]   position in God's kingdom he was going to replace one of the 12 who's going to go out
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:16.440]   and preach the gospel to the to the remotest part of the world so they couldn't have just
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:22.160]   chosen anybody so the criteria was a man who was with the Lord during his life and then
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:27.980]   he and then they had to meet this criteria so they had two people who met this criteria
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:34.980]   right and who are the two who are the two people who met the criteria?
[00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:45.880]   Barthas and Matthias right so among the two who was the one who was chosen?
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:51.240]   Matthias okay so but how did Matthias get chosen out of the two?
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.640]   Okay they cast lots what's what's casting lots?
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:04.000]   Just roll the dice think about what this position is this is the 12th disciple who in eternity
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.040]   is going to be one of the 12 rulers of his kingdom and they rolled the dice with this
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:16.800]   guy that was basically umim and thumim when they weren't clear about God's will they rolled
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:24.840]   the dice oh they say what that's a very strange part of God's commandment but this is the
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.960]   thing that you need to understand that it what they did roll the dice but they didn't
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:34.560]   roll the dice between should we worship God and Baal you know they didn't worship the
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:39.560]   worship um roll the dice between you know what let's we're going to choose Matthias
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:44.280]   and here's this drunkard who's hanging out at the you know hanging out at the at the
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:49.160]   temple worship and in worshiping idols say which one does God want let's roll the dice
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:56.120]   that wasn't the case both of them Matthias and Barsavas either one of them had a but
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.760]   would have been a good choice because they met all the criteria but how do they choose
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:10.480]   between the two so they rolled the dice now why would they roll the dice it doesn't say
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:19.600]   but I could totally understand the wisdom behind that can you I could totally understand
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:27.320]   the wisdom behind that because it was a choice between any one of these could be but because
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:36.300]   because the end result was so important it needed to be solidified fairly and so later
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:40.520]   on and say you know we thought Matthias and then you know eight people voted for Matthias
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.920]   and then three voted for the other and then the three and the eight start arguing say
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:49.120]   everything Matthias you know this guy's not very generous and he's kind of lazy and they
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:55.160]   said I told you we should have chosen Barsavas and I'll bet you that that humanly as it's
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.360]   just from my experience there would have been a division among the disciples like we should
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:06.280]   have chosen Barsavas right again this is just my taking it my insight into it like I don't
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:14.880]   think in God's wisdom in that situation it's better to be clear right that we rolled the
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:22.120]   dice and the dice falls on Matthias and we declare that this is God's choice with definitive
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:26.820]   action rather than say you know we all voted and we chose what was best we weigh the portals
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.200]   and cons and then we decided that this was the guy who's a little bit better than the
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:35.160]   other guy and then every time something goes wrong we question that decision so umim and
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:40.920]   thumen was not used in the context where where it was unclear it was kind of in those kind
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:46.800]   of situations where you wanted to solidify right this is God's doing where really it
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:51.920]   could have been one or the other okay I'm gonna move on from that because so many people
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:56.600]   ask this question so the rolling of the dice wasn't as just random chance as you think
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:02.480]   it is it just God's will that that really could have been one way or the other it's
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:07.760]   just to be solidified and say this is what God is doing instead of saying we did it okay
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:11.400]   I'm just gonna leave it at that if you have any questions we can talk about it afterwards
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:18.780]   okay Israel and the church are called a nation of priests so as a nation of Israel is ordained
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:23.560]   for ministry we are also called the priest so it's not like we have nothing to do with
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:31.620]   it all of this pertains to ultimately pointing to us so as Christians we are to be ordained
[00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:38.320]   right as Christians we are to be set apart to declare his glory and the language over
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:44.360]   and over again in the New Testament is to put on put on put off the old and put on so
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:50.240]   a Jew would have easily understood this as the instructions that given in Leviticus right
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:56.160]   so a common person because he was a Levite he would put on off his old clothes and he
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:01.600]   put on his new clothes for the purpose of serving God right and so we used we see that
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:07.440]   language again all over in Romans 3 14 put on the Lord Jesus Christ first that's only
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:11.320]   five eight since we belong to the day let's be sober having put on the breastplate of
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:16.920]   love and love faith and love Colossians 3 12 put on then as God's chosen one so over
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:21.960]   and over again you see in the New Testament this language of putting on right so when
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:27.440]   we think of putting on we think of just putting on clothes a Jew would have heard this easily
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:32.200]   connected to what we're seeing in Leviticus it wasn't just a common person putting clothes
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:37.960]   on so that they're not naked they're putting clothes on to set set them apart for God's
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:48.620]   holy purpose right that we're like articles that are set apart for God's use
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:55.400]   and then finally Moses anoints the tabernacle and Aaron with oil and so oil signified ordination
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:32:05.520]   at that time so they use a special oil of God's blessing upon them
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:13.600]   then we see in chapter 8 14 to 17 the sin offering for Aaron and his sons
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.320]   so for God to be present for the worker of the priest to offer sacrifice sanctuary needed
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:23.040]   to be purified that's the first offering commanded was sin offering or otherwise known as the
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:28.200]   purification offering which would make perfect sense before anything else happens they needed
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:33.080]   to be purified so the purification offering was the very first thing that they do so once
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:38.060]   they are the priests are washed they put on their holy garments the first sacrifice they
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:45.400]   give is a purification offering and then second one in verse 18 21 is the burnt offering for
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:52.280]   Aaron and his son what was the burnt offering for general atonement right was it for very
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:59.240]   specific sins or general sin general right it wasn't it wasn't just anything about one
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.160]   particular thing that you did wrong it was just the totality of who we are we they're
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:08.720]   repenting so that's why we equate that with justification justification isn't coming for
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:15.240]   God and saying I'm sorry that I stole right I'm sorry because I shouldn't have done this
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:20.440]   repentance when we first meet Christ is a repentance about who we are right and so the
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:26.240]   burnt offering represented that it represented the general atonement for the sins of Aaron
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:32.520]   and his sons and then again the instructions for this is more specifically prescribed in
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:38.240]   Exodus 29 15 to 18 so we're not going to look at that but that's where it's found the more
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:34:04.320]   detail and also Leviticus chapter 1 I miss something I don't have D huh okay well anyway
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:10.680]   the Rams consecration offer for Aaron and his sons chapter 8 22 to 30 normally the blood
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:14.320]   was sprinkled against all the altars but in this case some of it is smeared on the right
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.920]   ear right thumb right toe and on the clothes of Aaron and his sons right which is kind
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:27.480]   of strange this is only done in consecration of the priest the ears the thumb the toe and
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:35.600]   the clothes what do you think what do you think that symbolized clearly the blood represents
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:44.840]   what cleansing right purification cleansing so if their ear is being cleansed what is
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:54.920]   that what do you think that symbolizes to listen right if the thumb is being cleansed
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:35:01.920]   what do you think that represents purification of your work right so if the toe is being
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:06.720]   cleansed right I mean it's kind of tied to your thumb but it's the work where you're
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:12.360]   going right how you're living and then the clothes right in and of itself had to be cleansed
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:20.480]   and sanctified so in a commentary new international commentary of the Old Testament this is how
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:26.480]   Gordon Wenham explains it why should these points of his body be singled out for purification
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:31.280]   it is an example of the part standing for the whole the right hand side was considered
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:36.480]   the more more important of the favored side the priest must have consecrated ears ever
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:41.200]   to listen to God's holy voice consecrated hands at all times to do holy deeds and consecrated
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:46.640]   hands at all times to do consecrated feet to walk evermore in holy ways so again every
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:51.080]   single one of these kind of symbolized an action or something that they needed to do
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:57.160]   and that needed to be consecrated do you remember remember when Isaiah when he meets God in
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:03.000]   Acts not acts Isaiah chapter 6 what happens to him he falls down in terror and then what
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.600]   did you say I'm a man of unclean lips from a people of unclean lips so how does God prepare
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:19.080]   him for ministry he sends his angels and he takes a hole and he touches his mouth like
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:27.740]   burns his mouth and what did that burning of his mouth symbolized purification right
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:37.260]   and why was his mouth purified why not his ears and why not his feet
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:43.200]   because he was a prophet who's going to prophesy about God in fact Isaiah is probably considered
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.640]   one of the greatest prophets of the Old Testament because he speaks more about the coming of
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:53.000]   Christ than any other prophet right remember what we talked about when we're studying Isaiah
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.540]   Isaiah is considered the Romans of the Old Testament because the clearest presentation
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:05.520]   of the coming of Christ is written in the book of Isaiah so Isaiah he says he when he
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.840]   sees God the reason why he says I'm a man of unclean lips because he knows what's what
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.520]   he's being called to do right you don't know the kind of foul things that come out of my
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:19.920]   mouth you don't know you don't how can this lip proclaim your holy name and so God comes
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:24.960]   and touches his mouth and cleanses and purifies him in order for him to do that work and so
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:31.200]   the priests are being consecrated for the same purpose right but the priests work isn't
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:40.360]   to proclaim the good news was it oh their work was to listen to God and be a mediator
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:44.720]   and to work with their hands so their ears being cleansed their thumbs their toes their
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.560]   clothes right because God is purifying them for the work that they're about to do just
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:57.720]   like Isaiah with his mouth they were consecrated for seven days and obviously you guys know
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:03.840]   the seven days symbolizes a time of completion for seven days they are within that they're
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:09.840]   not allowed to come out and all seven days oh did I already put that there according
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:16.440]   to Exodus 29 35 every day a bull was offered on each of the following following six days
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:42.840]   and the purification
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:39:12.680]   okay all right there's a whole middle part that I didn't put up here okay
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:20.400]   you're just gonna have to follow along okay do you have it see I'm just gonna read it
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:26.360]   to you okay so Aaron's offering for himself and the people chapter 9 1 through 21 on the
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:35.040]   eighth day Aaron was to begin his ministrial work as a priest okay on the eighth day Aaron
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:39.520]   was to begin his ministry as a priest so for seven days they're inside six days bull is
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:45.840]   bulls are sacrificed to atone for their sins and the purpose of these sacrifices be is
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.680]   repeated twice in verse four and six that the glory of the Lord may appear to you so
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:56.600]   twice he said all of these are happening for what purpose so that God's glory may be revealed
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:09.480]   right let me ask you a question and I just wanted to think about it okay as much as you
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:14.760]   want to know the Lord as much as you want him to answer your prayers and know the intimacy
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:27.960]   is there any part that you play is there any part that you play that depends on you for
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:42.400]   your intimacy with God I'm gonna answer that question for you absolutely absolutely if
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.840]   we sit there kind of like well he loves me so much he died for me you know and why isn't
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:53.840]   God appearing to me you know while we're never touching our Bibles never praying never you
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:58.720]   know what I mean like living in obedience just kind of feeling bad about our sins and
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.560]   just kind of passively just kind of like you know get me on the right boat and then hopefully
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:07.160]   I make it over there and always wondering what's wrong what's wrong with other people
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:17.240]   how come I don't feel fellowship you know is there is there a part that you play absolutely
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:25.580]   when you feel disconnected with other believers how much of that do you play in that before
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.440]   you start looking at other people and it's like all these people are not doing this and
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:33.320]   those people are not doing that how much of that is because of you okay I say all of this
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:39.840]   because he says all of these things he gives he said in order for his glory to come so
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:45.840]   what if they didn't do it he couldn't come he wouldn't have come he said I want you to
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:50.280]   observe what I am telling you because his whole reason was he wants to draw closer to
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:59.600]   us why did he give the Bible to us it wasn't just for a security blanket the scripture
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:05.520]   basically is a revelation of himself if the scripture is a revelation of himself and we
[00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:09.360]   want to draw closer to God and yet we don't study the Word of God and we're wondering
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:16.360]   why we're not drawn closer to God the answer is pretty easy right God gave you the path
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:22.160]   to come and you're not taking it and you're looking for all kinds of other reasons why
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:29.120]   why I don't feel close to God is there a part that we play absolutely right we can't say
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:35.400]   you know the path to grace of the throne has been open to us and then and then wondering
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:42.080]   why I don't get there on a couch watching TV complaining about how other people aren't
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:48.320]   helping you get there right it's been given to us everything we need for a life of godliness
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:52.720]   has been given to us in the knowledge of his son Jesus Christ right everything has been
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:43:00.600]   given to us so the balls on our court it's in my hands if I want to there is no barrier
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:06.320]   between me and God if I want to pry out to God I have access to God now I have access
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:12.520]   to God I don't need you to get to God you don't need me to get to God you don't need
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:17.160]   me to open up to you John chapter 3 and tell you what it said you have the Word of God
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:23.560]   you don't need me I can help you but you don't need me right your friends can help you but
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:29.040]   you don't need your friends so to think that you're not getting to God because of other
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:36.000]   people and other things I said you've been given everything in Christ right the Old Testament
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.840]   believers didn't have this access to God to get to have his glory even be in the midst
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:48.080]   they had to go through all of this but all of this was paved by the blood of Christ right
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:52.840]   so I mean even they they couldn't complain if you obey all of this he said I will come
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:57.240]   and I will reveal my glory to you and they did it and when they did it the glory of God
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:03.080]   came right but all of this has been purchased for us by the blood of Christ and the door
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:09.880]   has been opened and now we have no excuse guess what read Hebrews chapter 10 because
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:14.560]   the whole point of Hebrews chapter 10 is say if God did that for the Old Testament believers
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:19.520]   how much more if you trample underfoot the Son of God after everything that he's done
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:25.600]   he said it's not enough right how can every how can any believer in the New Testament
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:33.240]   ever come before God and say I don't have enough right we have to stop looking to other
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:39.200]   people and other things we have everything and more and then some to get to God the robe
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:43.920]   it hasn't paid there is no barrier between God if I want to cry out to God I can do it
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:51.120]   tonight if I'm wondering where God is I can go to him today if I'm wondering what he thinks
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:57.200]   I can open up the scriptures right it's how everything that I have so all of this he says
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:04.240]   has been open to us in order that he can make a dwelling D right or C these sacrifices made
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:09.280]   to make fellowship with Holy God and his dwelling among his people possible the dwelling among
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:15.320]   his people possible D Aaron's first offerings included all the major sacrifices in Leviticus
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.440]   chapter 1 through 5 with the exception of the guilt offering and the reason why the
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:23.840]   guilt offering wasn't sacrificed was because the guilt offering was a very specific offering
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:34.040]   for a specific sin right for their ordination it was to cover all the general stuff I don't
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:39.840]   have the D either priestly blessing of the people a after Moses and Eric completed all
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:44.720]   the purification rituals and sacrifices what happens in verse 22 so let's let's go there
[00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:52.640]   for the last part chapter 9 verse 22 to 23 and Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:56.960]   and blessed them and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.680]   the peace offering and Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting and when they came
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:05.720]   out they blessed the people in the glory of the Lord appear to all the people just like
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:11.120]   he said if you do all of these things he says I will come and reveal my glory and then when
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:17.040]   they do it he comes and he reveals his glory in the verse 24 and fire came out from before
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:21.880]   the Lord and consumed the burnt offerings and the pieces of the fat altar and when all
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:27.280]   the people saw it they shouted and fell on their faces they basically the word fell on
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:31.800]   their faces proskuneo in the New Testament means that they broke out into spontaneous
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:40.480]   worship that's what happened when God's glory appeared right now here in the Old Testament
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:45.600]   in order for them to come before God to worship they needed to go through all of this the
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.000]   priest needed to be consecrated they need to put the right clothing on they need to
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.760]   pick the right animals they need to cut it up and sprinkle the blood everywhere they
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:56.540]   need to to be cleansed by their year their tongue their toes their and then they need
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:47:01.120]   to make sure that the altar was cleansed they need to make sure that the proper sacrifices
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:06.040]   were made sins were confessed the priest had the right garments on and they needed to be
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:12.320]   done morning and night over and over they need to go through all these rituals constantly
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:16.480]   in order for the glory of the Lord to appear so that they can worship God this is the only
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:23.200]   way that they could worship God we come to the New Testament the only reason why the
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:27.560]   glory of the Lord we're not in the presence of the glory of the Lord is because we don't
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:41.240]   want to and that is the only barrier between us and God our own desires our own distractions
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:51.400]   our own temptations we just don't want it we kind of want it but not really so the New
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:58.640]   Testament for New Testament Christian there's not a single Christian who is lacking something
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:05.080]   that prevents you from coming to God you're not lacking fellowship now some people's fellowship
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:09.200]   may be better than yours you're not lacking leadership now some people's leaders better
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:18.520]   maybe better than yours but according to scripture we have the glory of God in us so the only
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:28.280]   reason why we don't experience this this drama that we see in chapter 924 is lack of will
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:36.520]   right and that's what we struggle with our struggle right and and that's this is the
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:42.800]   reason why we can't complain when you have a grumbling spirit right you said after everything
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:47.000]   that God has done you say well Lord it's not enough it's because of this and because of
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.400]   that it's basically come before God and saying it's not enough you know I need Jesus and
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:58.120]   some other people I need Jesus and and better organization I need Jesus and better Bible
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:08.200]   study no there is no barrier between us and God there is no barrier between us and God
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:14.760]   and so what you and I need to be wrestling with every day is with ourselves you understand
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:25.040]   what I'm saying our primary focus of frustration should be me not my wife not my kids not my
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:33.560]   church not my small group not my friends not my circumstance not my job because if life
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:40.320]   is in Christ and I have been given access to Christ the primary thing that prevents
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:47.560]   me from coming to Christ is me nobody has changed me nobody has a gun against my head
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:55.800]   nobody's holding my feet back it's just because we are tempted with a world and we have one
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:05.960]   eye on the world and one eye on God and that's why we lack this fervency right I mean that's
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:11.520]   just that's just our honest confession including myself that's our honest confession and that's
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:18.880]   why it's important for us to come before the Lord you know like not frustrated with all
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:27.360]   these other people but with myself right just like that sinner beating his chest right even
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:33.520]   after all that you've given me I still struggle even even after the access even after taking
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:38.080]   care of all of this like we're in a new covenant and he said we we don't have to do any of
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:43.120]   this to get to God all we have to do is close our eyes and say I want you Lord right that's
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:48.800]   all we need to do get in a room by ourselves and pray I want you Lord and then he says
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:55.200]   you have access to me and then for us to not to do that and then complaining about other
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:51:03.000]   people you think about it from God's perspective right in the New Testament whenever the glory
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:13.040]   of God appears there's joy there's jubilation there's excitement there's fear there's generosity
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:20.520]   there's kindness it was it wasn't discipleship and don't get me wrong the Bible does tell
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:26.160]   us to baptize teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you right there is supposed
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:30.200]   to be instruction they're supposed to be modeling they're supposed to be teaching all of that
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:37.520]   is there but when you look at the New Testament we look at the Old Testament when God appears
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:42.320]   people just change it wasn't because of years of discipleship and instruction and leadership
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:49.280]   training and how to how to speak God's Word these people who are not generous became generous
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:55.100]   people who weren't joyful all of a sudden was was filled with joy people were living
[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:58.880]   in fear and running around even as they're running for their life they're sharing the
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:04.960]   gospel that's what happened when they were in the presence of God's glory it just happened
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:10.480]   right and that's why I think you know whenever you travel you go to certain areas of the
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:16.520]   world where people have nothing and all they have is intimacy with Christ and they are
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:22.640]   so much more effective in everything that they're doing their fellowship is better their
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:28.840]   evangelism is better they're more generous they're more sacrificial and just you just
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:35.760]   see the fruit and I think like in John chapter 15 when he says you cannot abide you cannot
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:40.840]   bear fruit unless you abide in me is it wow that's he really meant that because that's
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:53.520]   exactly how it works right my point of all of this is is the same our primary objective
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:59.840]   is to get to God because all the answers is found in Christ my joy is found in Christ
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:04.320]   my security is found in Christ my deliverance is found in Christ so that's why we became
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:07.840]   Christians because we believe that he is the author of life and that's why we confessed
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:14.840]   our sins that's why we we draw near to that's what we come to church on Sunday right so
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:21.260]   if if all life is found in Christ shouldn't be the greatest endeavor greatest purpose
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:30.760]   and greatest pursuit of greatest energy and greatest money should be committed to drawing
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:42.960]   near to Christ like no duh I mean nothing I said is so profound it's not profound you
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:52.840]   learn this in Sunday school right it's just we tend to forget our biggest problem is is
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:58.840]   we're tempted with the world and so we have a part of us that knows like okay answers
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:05.280]   found in Christ but I want the world that's the problem right because we have that we
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:11.320]   have the road I'm not sure if I want to take it today he's the answer and that's my life
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:17.960]   and that's what I want but I want some of that too that's our problem right you look
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:25.600]   in you know Acts chapter 2 when the Holy Spirit comes he comes in fire and then whenever his
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:33.460]   appearance comes they fall down to the ground and worship God if you've ever experienced
[00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:44.520]   like real worship and I'm assuming a lot of you have that's all you want right that's
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:48.880]   all you want I mean that's been my experience and I know that many of you experience the
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:58.240]   same thing like that's all you want all of a sudden you forget about your problems stress
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:03.880]   what people are saying about you what tomorrow is gonna bring what people think like all
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:09.920]   of that just dies in the presence of God and it's just nothing this doesn't seem to matter
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:14.480]   I mean it's we still need to live and pay bills but it's just it just doesn't seem as
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:21.240]   important when you're near Christ right and and we see that every time when they're near
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:29.840]   Christ right Isaiah falls down just just falls down in worship Ezekiel falls down Acts 123
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:36.040]   they're all everybody's living in all Matthew 17 the disciples when Jesus's glory is revealed
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:42.520]   they fall down revelations 117 John in the face of his God's glory he falls down revelations
[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:48.600]   five the four beasts and 24 elders are constantly are bowing down prostrated in worship and
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:52.680]   this is not God holding the neck and putting them down and say you better worship me it's
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:59.280]   just in the presence of his glory they can't help it's they can't help but to surrender
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:03.520]   so it's not a position of of where God's like forcing them out on their neck it's just they're
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:11.680]   just like oh my god and they were in such awe of God you know there's like such awe
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:21.720]   of God that their immediate instinctive reaction is falling down and worshiping the angels
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:27.480]   fall down and they worship the Hebrews 1220 he said therefore let us be grateful for receiving
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:31.720]   a kingdom that cannot be shaken this let us offer to God acceptable worship with reverence
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:40.680]   and all for our God is a consuming fire so let me conclude with this today if you are
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:49.560]   a believer in Jesus Christ and your communion with God isn't what it ought to be I don't
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:54.800]   care how great your marriage is I don't care how great your relationship is I don't care
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:57:02.520]   how much money you're making if you're a true believer in Jesus Christ you are miserable
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:11.760]   and you know it you know it you you may be working hard to make everything right but
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:19.320]   your communion with God isn't what it ought to be inwardly you're you're miserable because
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:27.200]   you know where life is and you're not going there if you're not a believer you may hear
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:31.280]   all of this and say well that's a lot of talk but I don't know what you're talking about
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:36.240]   but if you're a believer you know exactly what I'm talking about there is life in no
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:44.920]   one else but Jesus Christ all of this drama is for a reason all of this drama is so that
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:51.600]   when Christ comes so that these people would recognize that's what we've been waiting for
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:58.480]   so that glory that they experienced that they would experience when Christ came but they
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:02.440]   didn't experience him they should have instinctively recognized him if they were ever in the presence
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:07.400]   of God's glory before Christ came they wouldn't recognize the glory that was in Christ remember
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:13.360]   what Jesus said you don't recognize me because you never recognized my father you were never
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:17.400]   in the presence of my father so you so now that I'm before you you don't recognize me
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:24.200]   either so Christians who don't have an intimate relationship with Christ when Christ comes
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:30.640]   you're not gonna recognize him either because you know you came to church but you never
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:38.880]   had fellowship with him you don't understand right but if you're a believer I don't care
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:42.760]   what you're entangled with I don't know like what things that you're concerned about what
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:49.600]   you're praying about if you genuinely believe which I I believe that most of you are and
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:56.440]   your primary pursuit isn't to be at the center of where he is at the core of who you are
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:07.120]   you're miserable you might be blaming your friends your circumstance your kids but deep
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:13.520]   inside at the core of who you are the Holy Spirit is groaning on your behalf working
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:26.200]   to get you back to God right so sobering Leviticus is so sobering right it's also I don't know
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:36.360]   how else to explain it if you've never experienced the glory of God come to the Lord in genuine
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:43.240]   repentance maybe it's because you've never really repented maybe your heart and your
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:49.880]   life has never been consecrated and so you learn how to play the game come to church
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:53.520]   have the Bible go through the motions you learn how to play the game but you've never
[00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:57.960]   experienced the glory of God so we talk about all of this and you're studying all of this
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:02.760]   like you're studying some history but you don't get it right Christianity is not something
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:11.480]   you can study and by knowledge and by effort to come to God only people who have been consecrated
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:16.520]   by the blood of Christ can understand what I'm saying so if you've never experienced
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:22.080]   that I want to encourage you right come to the Lord in genuine repentance to meet the
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:27.920]   Lord Lord I want to know open my eyes to see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ right
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:34.720]   repent and receive his forgiveness those of you who have tasted the goodness of God remember
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:46.320]   what that tasted like compare that with what you're tasting now repent repeat and redo
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:52.400]   what you did at first remember what he said if you do not I will take away my lampstand
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:58.320]   and what is that lampstand it's his presence among his church it's his glory he said I
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:08.640]   will with I will withdraw my glory if you continue to walk in lukewarmness let's take
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:20.120]   some time to to examine to pray to be sincere and not to play church games but to but to
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:26.680]   really come before the Lord I don't know where you are in your walk with God no I and I'm
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:33.960]   not here intending to to like let's have revival but I know there's a lot of church games going
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:43.000]   on in our lives and all of that adds to nothing but frustration right only really meeting
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.880]   Christ is worth putting our energy into so I'm gonna pray for us I'm gonna put I'm not
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:54.320]   gonna explain the verses I'm gonna let you guys take some time to discuss and pray but
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:02:03.720]   I really want to encourage you to meet the Lord to hunger and thirst for righteousness
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:09.200]   that can only be satisfied when you're in the presence of God and to persevere in your
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:16.520]   prayers persevere and crying out and let God hear that this is more important to you than
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:23.200]   anything else that you you are pursuing right now and let God hear that let God know that
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:31.080]   so that he can answer you and satisfy you let me pray for us then I'll release you gracious
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:40.280]   and loving father you know our weakness you know our distraction you know our excuses
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:50.240]   Lord it may be strange to say oh or sometimes I look to these Israelites with envy that
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:03:03.080]   even though they lived in danger and even in fear Lord God and yet they saw your glory
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:15.000]   because of that glory they worshipped they rejoiced they lived and they were blessed
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:22.560]   Lord we are on this side of the cross and we wrestle to live in your presence you've
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:30.480]   given us access Lord God of the throne of grace you've commanded us to come to you Lord
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:42.560]   with confidence you called us co-heirs you adopted us as your children and yet we struggle
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:50.160]   Lord stir in us a hungering and thirsting for righteousness that our satisfaction may
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:57.000]   come from you and you alone help us Lord God to cut through all the superficial things
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:05.400]   that we've established in life all the fake securities Lord God that we lean on help us
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:12.400]   to be emptied of ourselves that we may have you and you alone I pray father you would
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:18.400]   anoint this time anoint our discussion anoint our small groups Lord God may it be a time
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.760]   of refreshing we thank you father in Jesus name we pray amen
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:31.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
