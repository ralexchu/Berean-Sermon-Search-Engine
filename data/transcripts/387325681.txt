[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.360]   Let's take a moment to turn our Bibles to the book of James chapter 3.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.360]   Excuse me.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.040]   I'll turn my Bible there too.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.040]   Okay.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.680]   I'll read for us the passage and we'll pray to begin.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.520]   James chapter 3 verses 13 through 18.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.360]   The scripture says, "Who among you is wise and understanding?
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.600]   Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in the gentleness of wisdom.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.360]   But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.040]   and so lie against the truth.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.800]   This wisdom is not that which comes from above, but it's earthly, natural, demonic.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.480]   For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder of every evil thing.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.040]   But the wisdom that comes from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable,
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.560]   full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.880]   And the seed of whose fruit is righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace."
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.800]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.360]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.560]   God, we are so incredibly grateful that as Ryan said, we have been given the privilege
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.640]   to know Christ, who is the answer to all, who is salvation.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.060]   And we are praying, Father God, that all the more as we live our lives, then we would grow
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.060]   in that.
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.480]   And what's more, as you continue to instruct us, as you continue to guide us, I pray that
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.280]   we will then grow in true biblical gospel wisdom.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.680]   That God, we would be maturing children, giving honor to you.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.920]   We also want to pray for our collegians who are at the retreat studying and learning.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.880]   We pray for fruitful times of both fellowship in Christ, of learning and growing.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.880]   We thank you, it's in Christ and we pray.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.880]   Amen.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.480]   I want to ask you by way of introduction, when you were in school, let's say high school,
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.080]   what kind of student were you?
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.040]   Junior high, high school, college years, what kind of student were you?
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.400]   There's two camps.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.880]   One that says, "I'm going to cram as much as I can and get this test done."
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.160]   And so by the time there's this kind of ebb and flow of you play, play, play, play, play,
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.040]   and then you cram, cram, cram, and you take your exam.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.240]   Or were you the kind of student who really felt like, "You know, I actually want to learn
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.120]   and retain this stuff because at some point I have to use it."
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.680]   And so you tried to study, you tried to actually apply, and you tried to make sure that when
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.400]   you come to just exam time, it wasn't just performance of test taking.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.960]   It was actually knowledge on paper.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.960]   For a lot of people, I'm just assuming, it's just hard to be that kind of student, right?
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.200]   It's just the general tendency is to be the crammer, is to be the procrastinator who says,
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   "You know what?
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   I just need to get this exam done."
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.120]   And what we realize is that in education, examinations are actually very important because
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.440]   it forces us to make sure, "Okay, am I actually learning?"
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.080]   Exams are designed to test and see what do you know?
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.240]   And then what's really interesting is there are different kinds of exams that is not so
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.920]   much intellectual or how well you retain information, but there are certain exams, let's say performance
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.280]   reviews, or even let's say in certain professions where the exam is not so much what do you
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.720]   know, but the exam is what can you do?
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.680]   Let's say for a test for firefighters, a test for certain officers, military personnel,
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.880]   what can you actually do in this moment?
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.240]   And what I'm saying is these kinds of examinations periodically are absolutely necessary because
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.600]   it's important for us to know, is there an actual skill?
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.680]   Is there actually a growth?
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.680]   Is there actually a capacity that we have?
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.600]   Now then applied to our Christian faith, what's very interesting is that this passage when
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.180]   you notice, it is an absolute call out.
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.600]   Do you know your stuff, right?
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.800]   The book of James is actually filled with tests.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.280]   The book of James can be actually organized into five different series of exams.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.600]   Some of these exams are can you handle trials?
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.620]   Through trials, what is exposed, what is contained in you?
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.360]   How are you handling these things?
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.040]   There's a test of how do you respond to the word of God?
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.360]   Do you actually obey and do?
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.160]   Or is it just right over your head?
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.880]   There's a test of your tongue, this powerful tool that I've given you, this powerful thing
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.280]   that you're supposed to use for the praise of God.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.960]   How do you use this massive power called your tongue?
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.980]   And then there's this, do you have wisdom?
[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.960]   Do you have knowledge and skill?
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.280]   And there is this call out because literally he says, "Who among you are wise?"
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.560]   It's almost like, "Hey, stand up if you think you can do this."
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.840]   And then he says, "Now show me."
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.480]   The passage literally straight up says, "Show me your good behavior.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.960]   Show me your wisdom."
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.560]   And that's why as I was reading this passage, I was so convicted, felt a little uneasy,
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.640]   almost felt like, "Oh goodness, I'm about to take this exam."
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.280]   And I'm going to go through some scrutiny and what James is going to do, the scripture
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:31.840]   is going to do, is really show us are we growing and maturing as good students of the Lord,
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.240]   good children of the Lord?
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.360]   And so the way that I'm going to structure this sermon is to say, of course God wants
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.040]   us to have wisdom.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.700]   Of course God wants us to live with maturity.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.320]   Do we have it?
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.580]   Do we have true wisdom as the Lord desires?
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.940]   And so we're going to describe it as examination questions.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.480]   Moving forward, then the first one is this.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.620]   First, true wisdom leads to skillful demonstration.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.500]   True wisdom leads to skillful demonstration.
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.280]   And my exam question to you is, do you know what you're going to get examed on?
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.640]   Do you know what you're going to get tested on?
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.700]   Some students show up to the test like, "Oh shoot, I didn't know this was on the quiz."
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.920]   May we not be those kinds of students?
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.960]   What am I saying?
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.320]   Most often when we think of wise, we think of, let's say, an old individual who has a
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.680]   gray beard, the wisdom is shown in the glory of his white hair, and he's teaching, lecturing,
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.440]   and the pupils are around him, and what he's doing is giving audible wisdom.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.440]   He's giving knowledge.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.940]   Let me drop some knowledge on you guys in my days, and then he starts telling everybody
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.760]   his experience and the stuff he's learned in the past.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.900]   Yes?
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:51.560]   But the kind of wisdom that God desires for us is far above and beyond that, is it not?
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.880]   The kind of wisdom that God desires for us is not something that you can just do audibly.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.200]   It has to be visible.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.000]   Look at the text.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.880]   The passage says, "Let him show."
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.600]   Do you have understanding and wisdom?
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:12.040]   "Then let him show it by his good behavior in the deeds and the gentleness of wisdom."
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:17.280]   The manner of your deeds, the quality of your life, and the general behavior in your daily
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.920]   routine, daily decisions, is it demonstrating wisdom?
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.720]   In the way that you make decisions, in the things that you do day to day, is it demonstrating
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.720]   wisdom?
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.640]   This is the overarching concept that the scripture teaches us.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:37.880]   God wants us to have a certain kind of wisdom and maturity, Christian growth, that is absolutely
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.000]   visible.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Absolutely visible.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.840]   For example, 1 Peter 2, verse 12.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.200]   The scripture says, "Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:54.600]   which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they what?
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.040]   Observe them, glorify God in the day of visitation."
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.800]   Not because you're like, "No, no, no, no, no, I'm not bad.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.800]   Trust me, I'm good."
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.640]   You're never going to win an argument like that.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.000]   But because they see you, it's like, "What?"
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.320]   They can see your works, they can see your deeds, then they'll glorify God.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.520]   Even more so, James, earlier in the book, in chapter 2, verse 18 through 20, he said,
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.080]   "But someone may well say, 'You have faith and I have works.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.640]   Show me your faith without works.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.960]   I will show you my faith by works.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.200]   You believe that God is one.'"
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.760]   You've got good doctrine, that's good.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.080]   But you do well, "The demons also believe and shudder.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.600]   But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow," contrary to wisdom, the foolish fellow
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.660]   believes that faith without works is okay.
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:48.440]   But he says, "No, faith without works is useless."
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.640]   Now that all makes sense to me, and the way I want to describe it to you is I want you
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:56.640]   to think about maybe just metaphorically the Christian life as a master craftsman, or the
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.840]   trade of being a craftsman, maybe a woodworker, right?
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.720]   A woodworker.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.040]   A good woodworker will know his stuff.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.440]   When they pick up a piece of lumber, they'll be like, "Oh, this is actually softwood, not
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.440]   good for furniture."
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.440]   What are you doing?
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.240]   Are you building furniture for the outdoors?
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.280]   Ah, then you need redwood.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.900]   You need cedar, because this and this and this and this.
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.480]   This stuff doesn't mold outside.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:24.980]   A knowledge base will be with a master craftsman who is wise.
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.200]   For you as a Christian, I will have to ask you this.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.380]   If you have been sitting in church, you've been going to church, and you've been living
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:36.480]   your Christian life, there then must be a growing knowledge base.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.640]   What is this?
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.800]   This is not holy.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.040]   You should be able to do that in wisdom.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.040]   What is this?
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.040]   This is God-pleasing.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:49.380]   You should be able to tag, label, and identify the stuff that is necessary, essentially is
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.760]   your working pieces.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.320]   But that's not enough.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.320]   Why?
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.600]   Because the master craftsman, he's sitting there like, "Oh, this is good lumber.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.040]   Oh, this is whatever."
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.280]   And then you go over with him to the table saw, and he's like, "How do you turn this
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.280]   on?"
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.280]   Right?
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.960]   Or all of a sudden, he sees the saw blade come up.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.800]   He's like, "That saw blade is big."
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.640]   And then if you've ever worked with wood or these tools that are loud, it's like, "Oh
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.640]   my gosh."
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.640]   He's all shocked by it.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.640]   You would sit there and be like, "What?
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.360]   Have you never used this thing?"
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:28.680]   And if it wasn't a woodworker, but it was your physician, you'd be like, "Someone
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.680]   else please."
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.680]   This guy's nervous.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.960]   He doesn't even know what tool that is.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.920]   If he looked over to his assistant, he's like, "Can you hand me that thingamabobber?"
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.120]   You'd be like, "No, no, no, no.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.120]   We're not doing this operation.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.840]   We're not doing operation with a guy who calls it a thingamabobber."
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.760]   You better know your stuff and know how to use it.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.040]   Biblically speaking, wisdom is not just knowledge.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:58.400]   Biblically speaking, all through Jewish history, when you look at the past, wisdom is skillfulness.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.600]   It's a knowledge base that is skillfully used for you to live a life that is pleasing to
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.600]   God.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.280]   It is used for you to avoid pain.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.200]   It is used for you to avoid sinfulness.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:15.360]   It guards you from that presumptuous, rebellious, and all kinds of deviance from God.
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.480]   And it moves you to walking with God in holiness.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:24.960]   That's the way Old Testament Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, all these things are seen as wisdom.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.960]   Does that make sense?
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:33.120]   But then for us, I got to ask you this question.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.360]   What's really interesting in the Book of Proverbs says a good reputation is worth more, the
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.280]   much more valuable, much to be prized than money.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:46.440]   Well, the thing about it is, is your track record, not that's a snapshot, but the film
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.400]   strip of your life, marked with a growing wisdom.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.400]   You know what?
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.400]   Earlier on, when I experienced this thing, I was like, "What is this?
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.080]   I don't know!"
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.640]   Are you growing in wisdom?
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.800]   Not only both in knowledge, substance of scripture, principles, and instruction, but there is a
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.000]   skillfulness to you.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.400]   I know how to decide what to do in this scenario.
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.520]   I know what I should be doing here.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:15.200]   And you know in this scenario, you know what's valuable?
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:21.280]   Is there a growing wisdom in you that is demonstrable, it's seen?
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.840]   Or is your reputation, it's like every time that guy hits a hard road, it's always like,
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.440]   "I don't know what to do!"
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.040]   And then they just go off into this horrible trail.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.000]   I'm asking you this question to examine your life.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.480]   Is there a growing wisdom, avoiding folly, avoiding childish decisions?
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.280]   This is the kind of test that God is going to ask.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.280]   Right?
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.160]   He's going to ask that, like, "What are you doing with your time?"
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.200]   So that's number one.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:55.640]   Moving forward to number two, true wisdom is not only seen, but as it's seen, it's humble.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.640]   And I put there, aka self-controlled.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.560]   Take a look at the passage with me again, verse 13.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.720]   It says, "Let him show his good behavior, his deeds, in the gentleness of wisdom."
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.480]   So yes, you're supposed to show it with good behavior, but it's supposed to be gentle.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.560]   Now, I've got an older brother who has three daughters.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.280]   I always saw my older brother as like, "Dang, this guy's a man."
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.360]   When he was in high school, he lifted, he was kind of big, he had a shaved head in high
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.480]   school and stuff.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.800]   And so for me, I always saw him as like, "This guy's a man."
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.520]   And he had three daughters, and he got all gentle.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.080]   He's all soft, like, "Elise, do you want to..."
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.080]   His voice changes.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.080]   Have you seen that?
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.160]   Where it's all airy and soft?
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.480]   Okay, that's typically what we think when we think gentle, like tender-hearted, which
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.040]   is good, because biblically, that is gentleness.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:48.160]   But here, there's a really interesting nuanced word that is translated differently in different
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.160]   translations.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:55.480]   The NIV translates it, "Humility that comes out of, or comes from, wisdom."
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.560]   The ESV says, "It is meekness in wisdom."
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.560]   Hmm.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:05.480]   Clearly, then, the translators had some tough time describing this, and it's true.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.880]   You guys all know, those of you guys who speak two languages, there are certain terms you'll
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.260]   just never be able to do a one-to-one correlation and translation, right?
[00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.740]   These are one of those terms.
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:19.600]   So I'm going to give to you an interesting definition I found through a resource.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:27.280]   The idea is more so not just gentle and soft, but meek, but not in a man's outward behavior
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:34.680]   only, nor in just his relation to his fellow man or his mere natural disposition.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:40.040]   Rather, it is an in-wrought grace of the soul, and the expressions of it are primarily towards
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.040]   God.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.560]   So what the biblical commentators do is they just start bean-counting.
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.560]   Where was this word used through the Bible?
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.860]   And they just look at every single instance, and they notice a pattern.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:55.760]   This is typically towards God, and the attitude is a spirit where we accept God's dealing
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.480]   with us as good, and do not dispute or resist.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.480]   That's meek.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.200]   Do you see that?
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.580]   And then he says, "This word protest, according to Aristotle," now they track.
[00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.080]   Where is this word used in other literature?
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.960]   "In Aristotle, it is the middle standing between two extremes, one side getting angry
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.300]   without reason," always like, "Raaah," like brute force.
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:23.160]   "But the other, never getting angry at all, pushover, doormat.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:28.380]   Therefore, protest is getting angry at the right time, in the right measure, for the
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.380]   right reason."
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.380]   Wow.
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.880]   "Protest is not readily expressed in English.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:38.040]   There is no one-to-one correlation, but it is a condition of mind and heart which demonstrates
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:43.800]   dentalness not in weakness, but in power, in a balance born in strength of character."
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.800]   Dang, that is a rich word.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.080]   Let your wisdom be like that.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:54.500]   And you're like, "Oh, that sounds all good, but, huh?"
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.040]   You know what's going to help for us?
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.400]   What is the prime example of this kind of meekness, humility, gentleness, where there
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.640]   is power, where there is certainty?
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.640]   It's Jesus Christ.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:11.920]   You guys remember when he gave the incredible invitation to his disciples, and he said,
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:17.040]   "Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.200]   Take my yoke upon you and learn from me."
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   Why?
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   "Because I'm the master teacher."
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   Right?
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.600]   "'Cause I'll be your coach, and I'm going to whip you into shape, and you're going to
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.600]   take over the world."
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.600]   That's not what he said.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.840]   He says, "Why?
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:34.800]   Come to me, take my yoke, because I am gentle and humble in heart.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.840]   You will find rest for your souls."
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.960]   That to me is incredible.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.960]   Is Jesus Christ like meek and beating around the bush when he teaches?
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:46.160]   No, he's not beating around the bush.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:52.880]   Jesus Christ speaks authoritatively, but that authority and power is controlled.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.880]   It's humble.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.880]   Right?
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:00.880]   We see the perfection of this wisdom and humility in Christ.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:06.880]   He has such stability and self-control that when he is reviled, he does not revile back.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:12.120]   When it is appropriate, he shows what's true and what's right.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:16.560]   This is the kind of gentle humility that we want to exhibit.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:24.720]   And so, as a means for you guys, in your Christian life, have you been a newbie craftsman who
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.680]   does not have this control?
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.360]   Are you right now growing in control?
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.520]   For example, when I think of a newbie craftsman, number one, he's too scared.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.200]   He comes in, he's like, "Oh my gosh, I'm supposed to hold that power tool?
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.760]   That thing can shave off my arm."
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.760]   Right?
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.520]   Like, "Oh, I don't know what to do."
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.520]   That's not control.
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.280]   That's not confidence, and you're probably going to get hurt.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:51.680]   But on the flip side, if you see certain people have a major task, a big task at hand, you're
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.720]   supposed to build furniture for the king, you're like, "Oh my gosh."
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.720]   Right?
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.720]   So, certain things don't work.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.720]   You get all frustrated.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.000]   It's like, "How come this is not working?"
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.160]   You're all impatient with yourself.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.680]   Like, "I can't do this."
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.720]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.640]   We are challenged and tested in so many different ways.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:15.240]   And when we are growing in this kind of mature control, all kinds of anger will come out,
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.880]   impatience will come out, fear, interpretation, all this stuff will come out.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.560]   And my question to you is, are you growing in this?
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.280]   Are you growing in this?
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:30.440]   Because we're supposed to be growing as children of God, as disciples of Christ, in this kind
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.260]   of wisdom.
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:38.000]   And scripture says, I want to give you another passage from James chapter one, that he'll
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.360]   constantly contrast for us in teaching us what is contrasted with the wisdom of God.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.680]   On the flip side sometimes, James chapter one, 19, 20, he'll say, "This you know, my
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:52.160]   beloved brethren, that everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow in anger,
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:57.880]   for the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God."
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.080]   I love that.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:06.120]   The frustrated, annoyed, irritated, and impatient anger of man saying, "We need to get this
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.120]   work done.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.120]   This finisher must be done."
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.120]   Right?
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.320]   "How come it's taking so long?"
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:16.120]   That doesn't accomplish the kind of righteousness that God desires.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.320]   But in wisdom, have you thought through that?
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.240]   Have you thought through that?
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.160]   And so, I want to put up an interesting kind of Venn diagram for you, because that's what
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.040]   scripture is doing.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.360]   True good wisdom of God.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.560]   It will represent itself in good deeds.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.080]   And you will be tested on those good deeds, that is it visible or not?
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:41.600]   But what's more true, good, good, godly wisdom will be humble and self-controlled.
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.800]   And then he contrasts that in the next section, and he starts to describe the false kind of
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.120]   wisdom, the kind of wrong wisdom that we might exercise.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.040]   And he says that this wisdom is absolutely selfish.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.480]   Let's take a look at the passage, and this is what he says.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:00.360]   Verse 14, "But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.600]   be arrogant, and so lie against the truth.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.520]   This wisdom is not that which comes from above, but is earthly, natural, and demonic."
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.780]   Wow, okay?
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:12.520]   What a contrast.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:19.120]   And so what he says is, there is this false wisdom, but that to me is very interesting.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.280]   Because if you ask the question, what is the opposite of wisdom, for lack of better words,
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.740]   it's to be dumb.
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.600]   To be foolish is maybe a more biblical way to say it.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.520]   You're just foolish, right?
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.200]   But when you think of foolishness, what do you normally think of?
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.880]   I would have expected that the Bible would say, if you're foolish, then you don't know.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.880]   You're just ignorant.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.880]   Right?
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.920]   You don't know what's going on.
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.920]   You don't know what to do.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.960]   You don't know how to decide.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:55.060]   What's very interesting is, he says, the false wisdom, it actually is derived from your selfish
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.840]   ambition.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.100]   And we know this.
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.100]   We know this experientially.
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.560]   What do I mean that we know this experientially?
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:07.720]   Because many of us have experienced what it feels like to know up here exactly what we
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.440]   ought to do, and then do otherwise.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.880]   I call this the, you have conviction on Sunday, but you have sin on Monday.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.880]   Right?
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.000]   You come into service, you're convicted, you know what you ought to do, and then Monday,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.040]   whether it be your challenge to forgive, your challenge to be patient, your challenge to
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:30.300]   be focused and not distracted, and then Monday, I know what to do, but I can't do it.
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:34.020]   And sometimes that has been our maturity ever since we were young.
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:38.140]   Our parents, it's not like they didn't tell us, dude, don't do this because you're going
[00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.140]   to hurt yourself.
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.140]   Right?
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.140]   You better check yourself for your records.
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.140]   Right?
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:45.820]   And how many times have our parents told us the same thing multiple times, only for us
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:51.660]   to be like, I know, I know, and get all frustrated, like stop lecturing me, and then do it.
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.040]   And all of a sudden, it really does make sense.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:59.560]   I mean, take a moment just now to do the evaluation.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.480]   Do the history of yourself.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:08.520]   In moments of frustration, in moments where you really regret your decisions, in moments
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:13.360]   where you wish, like, I really wish I had a take back, because that was a bad, bad moment
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.020]   in life.
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.320]   Was it because you didn't know what was good?
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.800]   You didn't know what people would be upset by?
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.680]   You genuinely didn't know what you kind of ought to do?
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.680]   No.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:31.920]   Those moments are probably filled with, I could not control what I wanted.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.080]   I did it because I wanted to.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:39.840]   You couldn't control that inner desire, and the longing, the love, the craving, the hunger.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.480]   A lot of times, our struggle is not just simply knowledge up in the head.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.000]   A lot of times, it is the submission of our own will.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.800]   And that's why scripture says, "Watch over your heart with all diligence, for from it
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.160]   flows."
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.880]   It flows the spring of life.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.480]   That's Proverbs chapter four, verse 23.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.840]   And what's more, Proverbs 25, verse 18 says, "Like a city that is broken into, and without
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.360]   walls is a man who has no control over his spirit."
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:14.520]   Scripture knows this.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.840]   Scripture knows this.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.240]   And we know this.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:22.080]   The greatest thing oftentimes that we need to control is our ambition and our heart's
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.080]   desires.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.400]   And let's make some further observation.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:31.800]   We recognize that this selfish ambition is an incredible force to be dealt with.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:37.320]   And for you, I don't know if you think wisdom means I can wax eloquently about systematic
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.240]   theology, which is still really good.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.240]   You should be able to.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.900]   Maybe I can do the apologetic on teaching everybody why Christianity is so smart and
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.640]   everything is so dumb, right?
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:55.680]   However, wisdom often is seen in a man who can domesticate one of the greatest beasts
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.660]   that live in our lives.
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.280]   And that is that internal desire.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.680]   You know what's really interesting is that word for selfish ambition, it is tied together
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.040]   with bitter jealousy.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.400]   You saw that?
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.240]   Bitter jealousy has many different translations.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.960]   So when you do that word study again, like how is it used here?
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.480]   How is it used there?
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.800]   Sometimes translated zealous, right?
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.240]   When you're zealous for something.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:25.860]   And what's more, the term for selfish ambition, the word for ambition is really weird because
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.520]   if you take it literally, like you're not using it metaphorically, but you just take
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.440]   it literally, it means a mercenary.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:40.100]   You can't say like a mercenary, a hired hand to do the dirty deed.
[00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:41.100]   That's really interesting.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.940]   But what it says is sometimes it's translated man of strife.
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:48.280]   What it tells you is this is a force to be reckoned with.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.580]   Your internal desires don't just sit there like now that I'm a Christian, I want all
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.640]   things godly and I want nothing for myself.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.900]   That is not the way it works, is it?
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:02.300]   The desires of your heart must be constantly kept in check.
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:06.500]   The desires of your heart must be constantly ruled by you.
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.500]   And you must domesticate it almost.
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.780]   Sometimes you need to put it to death.
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:16.580]   And scripture says this is at the heart of true wisdom.
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.820]   Why?
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:23.980]   Yesterday we had a seminar about finances.
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.700]   And what's really interesting is I shared how I had a pendulum swing.
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.980]   When I became Christian, I took this vow like all money is wicked.
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.740]   Look at all these wicked people.
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.180]   And part of that was because I was wicked with money.
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.500]   I mean, I fantasized about money.
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.580]   I've confessed on this pulpit many times.
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:48.660]   I literally had daydreams, wishful thinking, and dreams of owning the world.
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:53.900]   You can take heaps of money pile because that to me was incredible value.
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.140]   That to me was my pride.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.220]   That to me was my answer to all the struggles of our family.
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.380]   That money to me was everything.
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.540]   It's my answer.
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.540]   And then so I pendulum swung.
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:07.980]   I became Christian and I was like all money is wicked.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.100]   Money does not make you wicked.
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.700]   Scripture tells you that.
[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:17.900]   All money is is paper with dollar signs on it and has a monetary value in your economic
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.500]   system.
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.860]   Your heart's wicked.
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:26.300]   In the hands of a man with a wicked heart, that money will be used as a powerful tool
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.300]   of destruction.
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:37.420]   Now as we think about this, all I'm saying with that then is money is not wicked.
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:41.460]   When the wickedness lies in your heart, now I have to ask you and we have to do that examination
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:42.460]   as the scripture does.
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:47.660]   What do you want?
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:55.780]   Are you wise enough to look into your heart and then start to decide and determine, do
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.260]   some judging of yourself?
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:01.140]   Oh my gosh, I want this thing but it's wicked.
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.140]   It's so selfish.
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.860]   There are so many people who are lost.
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:06.860]   Is this selfish?
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:07.860]   No.
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:11.380]   That shows me you have much more wrestling to do.
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.980]   That shows me you have much more learning to do.
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:20.820]   Have you exercised the wisdom of God to let the scriptures start to judge the intentions
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:27.180]   and thoughts that are in your heart and therefore exercise a great wisdom.
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.780]   I want to tell you this, this is at the heart of this message.
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:34.260]   This is at the heart of what we need to get to because scripture says that the indicator
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.700]   of your wisdom is going to be the desires and ambitions of your heart.
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:43.660]   Your selfish ambition is going to be to you the greatest hindrance for you to live as
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.260]   a wise child of God.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.820]   And you know what's really interesting?
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:54.060]   What scripture kind of hints at is this, buy what you want, it starts to be indicative
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:57.180]   of who you are.
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:02.540]   You want to find out if somebody is super shallow, ask them what they like.
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:08.020]   And when you see somebody who loves shallow stuff, a man who's always attracted to a shallow
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:13.700]   girl because all he sees is externals, a man who makes his decision based on all superficial
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.300]   things, he's a shallow man.
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.300]   You are childish, why?
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.960]   Because you love childish stuff.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.140]   You are worldly and earthly, why?
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.820]   Because you love earthly stuff.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:31.460]   Your desires start to determine and judge who you are.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:36.080]   And so I ask you, brothers and sisters, what do you want today?
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.260]   Are your desires your greatest desires?
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:42.240]   Does it have anything to do with God and his kingdom?
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.900]   What do you hope to produce?
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.020]   What do you want to be known for?
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.140]   Why?
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:51.900]   Because your wisdom is going to be used to get it.
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.800]   Your wisdom is going to be used to get it.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:29:00.300]   And therefore, ambition, wisdom, all these things.
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:04.940]   Ambition in and of itself is not wrong, right, or evil, or wicked, but for what goal you
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:09.860]   use them, now all of a sudden you become a villain, right?
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:14.540]   You could have the greatest wisdom of how to make objectives, you could have the greatest
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:18.220]   wisdom of, you know what, although these are the resources we need, these are the personnel
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.860]   that we need, these are the benchmarks that we need, this is the process by which we're
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.180]   going to achieve this task.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.860]   Great.
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:33.220]   As soon as to your ambition you add the word selfish, now it's become wrong.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:38.300]   What I'm trying to say is we as believers, we are taught in scripture, you actually should
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:43.580]   be some of the most ambitious people on the face of this planet, right?
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:50.300]   You should be persevering, you should be sacrificing, you should know what it means to work hard.
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.900]   We should be as Christians some of the most ambitious people.
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.500]   Now for what?
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.700]   For what?
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:05.660]   If you've tagged your desire on the things of this earth, your world view is so small.
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.900]   Set your heart and ambition on the things that are massive, true, weighty, and actually
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.620]   desirable, which are the things of God.
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:16.340]   And so I want to move quickly into the next point.
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:19.180]   True wisdom then operates in reality.
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.660]   What do I mean by that?
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:25.780]   Our faith informs the reality that the ambitions of this world, you may have them, but it's
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.020]   foolish why?
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.500]   It's so temporary and fleeting.
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.700]   What are you doing?
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.180]   And what's more, this passage talks about this in a kind of nuanced way.
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.980]   What do I mean?
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.700]   Go back to verse 14 and it says, "But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:48.140]   in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth."
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.860]   Don't be arrogant and so lie against the truth.
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.020]   That's really interesting.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:57.500]   The command there is to stop, knock it off, being this arrogant person or a prideful individual
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.100]   who is boasting.
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:03.100]   And when you do that, you're lying against the truth.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:07.500]   Now just a moment ago, I just told you, right?
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:12.780]   I just told you that we should be some of the most ambitious people because we actually
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.740]   have something worthwhile to be ambitious for.
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:23.780]   Because on the flip side of it, we actually should be boastful people then.
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.740]   And you're kind of like, "Huh?
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:29.840]   Why would we be boastful people?"
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.500]   Because we then, in our faith, actually have something to boast of.
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:35.780]   I have hope.
[00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.060]   I have eternity.
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:44.340]   I have power supernatural by the Spirit of God and I have a heavenly Father who is perfect.
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.540]   Take a look at this passage with me.
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:49.180]   Jeremiah chapter 9 verse 23 to 24.
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:54.820]   Jeremiah chapter 9 verse 23 to 24, "Thus says the Lord, 'Let not a wise man boast in his
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.820]   wisdom.
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:57.900]   Let not a mighty man boast in his might.
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.980]   Let not a rich man boast in his riches.'"
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:00.980]   Why?
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.420]   "Because truth be told, all those things are false."
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.180]   There's nothing to be boasting in.
[00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:10.860]   "But let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows me.
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:15.420]   And that I am the Lord who exercises loving kindness, justice, righteousness on earth.
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:20.780]   So I delight in these things, declares the Lord."
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.880]   You know what pride is?
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:28.620]   At any moment, you really, really want to be, or at any moment, you really, really actually
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:33.060]   believe that you are more than reality.
[00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.100]   Right?
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:42.180]   When you think highly of yourself beyond what is true and real, that is absolute arrogance.
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:47.340]   And honestly speaking, to have a selfish ambition where although in reality you're a slave of
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.380]   God, although in reality you're a servant of the Lord, although in reality you're a
[00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:55.700]   child of God, to demand your agenda, to demand your way, to demand that the God of the universe
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:02.420]   or the people around you fulfill your ambition, that's something so deceived about that, isn't
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:04.460]   there?
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.060]   Absolute arrogance.
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:15.580]   And so, scripture talks about how here, for us, we are to operate in reality.
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:21.900]   It is also not humble, it is also not godly of us to go beyond that on the flip side,
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:26.180]   where we absolutely smash ourselves and we say, "We are absolutely worthless.
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.900]   There is nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.660]   I'm just a worm."
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:30.660]   Right?
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.340]   Well scripture is very clear.
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.740]   We're depraved.
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.020]   We're altogether, right?
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:39.700]   Humble and stained and we are helpless.
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:43.060]   But the God also says, "No, aren't you more valuable than two sparrows?"
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:44.060]   Right?
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.060]   "Aren't you more valuable?
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.660]   Are you not precious to me?
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:48.060]   Will I not provide for you?"
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.780]   What am I saying there?
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:55.940]   On the spectrum of the way that we deal and interpret, to be wise does not mean just to
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:02.040]   smash yourself and get low, but rather it means to operate in reality.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.860]   This is the way that we have to make sure that we're not lying against the truth.
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:10.620]   Now I want to talk about something here a little bit.
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:16.340]   Just as a way, as an example, to take a moment of breather to think about wisdom.
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:20.860]   The other day I was watching a silly TV show with my boys.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:25.580]   And it was so funny because we were watching a bunch of grown men go fishing and then after
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:29.660]   they caught their fish, they got together, they cut up the fish and was eating sashimi.
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.380]   It was so funny.
[00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:32.380]   And we were eating dinner too.
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:36.820]   And it was so funny because I was watching that and I was like, "Oh, it must be so yummy."
[00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:37.820]   And like slobbering.
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:38.820]   Right?
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:44.140]   It was so funny because all it was a bunch of guys eating fish and then the guy who was
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:48.740]   the captain of the team or the guy who was actually running the boat and stuff, he goes
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:51.260]   on this monologue and he's like, "You know what, girl?
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.260]   You got to follow your dreams.
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.260]   Don't let anybody tell you no.
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:54.260]   You can't ever be put down by other people.
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:35:00.340]   And if you hit that wall, you just got to keep going."
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:01.980]   Now I get it.
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.140]   This is really good.
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.820]   And everybody needs to learn that.
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:05.820]   Right?
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:10.540]   But what he was saying was, look how much they're enjoying life by going out and fishing,
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:11.820]   catching a wonderful fish.
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.780]   They caught a yellowfin tuna.
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.220]   They had sashimi that thing.
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:16.220]   They were eating it.
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:17.220]   They're like, "This is your dream.
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:19.220]   Don't let everybody tell you no."
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.220]   I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.020]   There was a little part of me that was like, "Yeah.
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.700]   That must be awesome."
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:33.500]   And when you hear that, I mean, everybody, we've all heard that in this world.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.060]   Do you hear the arrogance in that?
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.300]   "I'm just going to do this.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.500]   No one's going to say no."
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.940]   What if your father says no?
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:42.940]   I'm looking at my kids.
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:46.580]   Part of me want to be like, "Don't listen to him, guys."
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:49.740]   You're not supposed to just go and follow your dream like nobody's telling you no.
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:55.020]   The world's wisdom is absolutely contrary and they can't even hear the arrogance when
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.980]   they say stuff like that.
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:02.780]   Let us not be those who operate under this kind of worldly wisdom.
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:07.220]   Moving forward, number five, true wisdom perseveres order and righteousness.
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.420]   These next couple points are going to get a little shorter.
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:11.980]   Look at what the passage says.
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:20.180]   For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder of every evil thing.
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:24.820]   And what's more, look at the passage, it describes that this is not from above.
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:29.780]   In verse 15, he describes this as earthly, this is natural, and then boom, demonic.
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:30.780]   Whoa.
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:31.780]   Why?
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:32.780]   Why?
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.220]   Let me just make this statement.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.740]   When your selfish ambition is not controlled and put into check, you know what it's going
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:39.740]   to do?
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.820]   It is going to do the age old methodology and strategy of the devil.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.820]   It will scheme.
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:47.540]   Yes?
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:50.820]   It will scheme to have what it wants.
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:55.020]   Sometimes it will lie, sometimes it will fudge the truth, sometimes it's going to manipulate
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:58.540]   you, sometimes it's going to use all kinds of pity parties, sometimes it's going to use
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:36:59.540]   anger.
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:02.220]   I can't get what I want through reason because it doesn't make sense, so you know what I'm
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.220]   going to do now?
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.220]   I'm going to pound the table.
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:07.100]   Don't mess with me, I'm mad.
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.940]   Give me what I want.
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.300]   Real quick heart check for you guys.
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:15.640]   Again, today's theme is tests, examinations.
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:21.180]   If you do not have your selfishness in check, you will find yourself resorting to all kinds
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.700]   of means to get what you want.
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:25.860]   There is an appropriate way to get angry.
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:29.520]   There is an absolutely manipulative way to get angry.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:34.300]   Have you in your life exhibited foolishness, lack of wisdom because you use anger to get
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.620]   your way?
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:38.940]   Honest question.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:43.020]   Do you use anger in your relationships, in your marriages, in your friendships, with
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:48.140]   whatever it may be that you use anger as a means to let the other person know, "Don't
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.140]   mess with me.
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:52.380]   I'm going to win."
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.780]   We have to heart check.
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.780]   Biblical wisdom is contrary.
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:57.780]   Yes?
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:01.160]   God's going to look at that and say, "You foolish man.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.900]   You foolish girl."
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.980]   There is all kinds of wickedness in that.
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:09.140]   If you turn your Bible to James chapter four, verse one through three, he actually explicitly
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.140]   says, "This is the reason for all your troubles."
[00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:15.020]   James chapter four, verses one through three, this is what he says, "What is the source
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.980]   of quarrels and conflicts among you?
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:22.700]   It is not the source of your pleasures that weighs war in your members.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.340]   You lust and you do not have, so what do you do?
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:26.840]   You commit murder.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:31.220]   You are envious and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel.
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:32.940]   You do not have because you do not ask.
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:36.980]   You ask and do not receive because you ask with wrong motives so that you may spend it
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:38.900]   on your pleasures."
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:39.960]   Dang.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.740]   He just spells it out.
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:42.740]   Right?
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.980]   He just spells it out.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:45.980]   Believe it.
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:51.080]   The scripture is wise to notice that selfish ambitions and zeal for your own gain will
[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.980]   produce nothing but disorder and unrighteousness.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:59.460]   However, earlier I gave you a Venn diagram.
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:04.340]   I want to describe to you for a moment what the scripture is going to do is give you rapid
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:09.340]   fire, look at how deep, look at how lovely.
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.700]   Look at godly wisdom.
[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.640]   Are you growing in these things?
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.700]   For the sake of time, I cannot go through every single one of these things, but let's
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.980]   take a moment to just first read it.
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:25.700]   Starting from verse 17, "The wisdom from above that God desires for his godly children who
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:32.780]   are growing and maturing is first pure, is peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy,
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:35.860]   of good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy."
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.480]   Dang.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.520]   That's a lot to go through.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.880]   What I'm going to do is do my best in brief summary of those things.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.720]   Just try to paint a picture of good godly wisdom.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:51.700]   And the question to you is going to be, have you exercised this kind of spiritual good
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:56.200]   wisdom or in your thinking, your maturity and growth was going to be, I'm going to do
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.200]   my Bible study.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.200]   Right?
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:04.500]   Unfortunately, sometimes that's the case for Christians who are just walking this very
[00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:05.920]   plateau Christian life.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:06.920]   I'm just going to do my Bible study.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:07.920]   I'm going to be faithful.
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:09.980]   I'm going to learn.
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:13.880]   But the scripture is challenging us to higher standards and higher heights and saying, are
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:17.080]   you exercising this wisdom?
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.080]   This wisdom.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.440]   So let's begin.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:25.120]   True wisdom is first, he says, very pure.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:30.360]   The idea of purity has the idea of innocence and a lot of times that purity is actually
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.800]   wrapped up with the concept of a virgin being chaste.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:34.800]   Right?
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:42.400]   And the idea is you haven't given yourself away to the desires and allurements, right?
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.960]   You haven't contaminated yourself with the filth of the world.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.720]   And what's more, there is this purity in your heart that you're seeking.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.800]   I want to highlight a passage for you because again, I want to give you pictures.
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.720]   King David wanted purity in his heart.
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:41:00.480]   King David, he's repenting after some heinous sin, heinous sins.
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:04.400]   In Psalm 51 he says, this will purify me with hyssop.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.000]   Wash me and I shall be clean.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.920]   Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:12.360]   Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit in me.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:19.920]   Brothers and sisters, did you exercise this wisdom where you are asking the Lord, God,
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:20.920]   clean me.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:24.560]   You know what I'm going to confess?
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:28.600]   A lot of times I'm just walking my life, walking my life, assuming I'm pure.
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:32.600]   And then God has to interject like, hello, what are you doing?
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.920]   And I'm like, oh, I'm sorry.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.920]   Are you regularly in wisdom?
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:41.560]   A wise child is asking the Lord, God, wash me, cleanse me.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.080]   Let me open this up.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.640]   Is there hurtful ways right here?
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.360]   That's King David's heart.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.520]   And what's more, there's another passage I want to highlight for you.
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:55.080]   It comes from 2 Corinthians chapter 7 where Apostle Paul describes true godly repentance.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:59.840]   And he says, for the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:01.800]   regret leading to salvation.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.280]   But the sorrow of the world produces death.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:08.720]   For behold, what earnestness this very thing, this godly sorrow has produced in you, listen
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:16.880]   to this, what vindication, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, zeal for
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:24.080]   godliness, what avenging of wrong in everything you demonstrate, okay, you demonstrate yourselves
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:28.000]   to be innocent in the matter.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.760]   In your relationships, when you hurt somebody, right, is your thought like, oh, just don't
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.760]   make it a big deal.
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:39.200]   I'm sorry, okay, I'll do better next time, right?
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.720]   Or are you showing this?
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.240]   You have a zeal to make it right.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.960]   You have a zeal to be innocent of a certain matter.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:51.120]   You're not just saying like, please stop nagging me and pointing all the flaws at me.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.760]   Are we all sinful?
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.760]   Stop making a big deal.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:58.040]   Your heart is set on innocence and purity.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:03.360]   You desire in the innermost part, clean heart.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.280]   What a good motive, right?
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:06.960]   What good desire?
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.360]   What purity?
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.600]   What's more, true wisdom is peaceful.
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.600]   You know, I love the way the NIV translates it.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:16.060]   It says peace loving.
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:18.320]   Are you a peaceful man?
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.520]   Are you an individual that loves peace?
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.280]   And peace naturally has a relational attitude, right?
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:27.360]   If selfishness was me, you better acknowledge me.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.080]   If selfishness was I need to have my way.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:36.080]   If selfishness is me, my, and mine, peace is us, right?
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:42.000]   Have you exercised a certain wisdom in your life where you're able to be peaceful, that
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.400]   you love peace?
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.400]   You know who's really wise?
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.280]   Have you guys ever gotten in a fight where you're like, I don't, we're just missing each
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.280]   other, man.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.400]   We're just like communicating, but it's just like blah, right?
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.200]   A novice craftsman would be like, I'm frustrated, forget you.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.920]   We're not, we're not doing this.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.160]   I'm done, right?
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:04.040]   But the skilled craftsman, even in peacemaking will come in and say, let me understand what's
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.960]   going on.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:06.960]   What happened?
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:07.960]   What are you saying?
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:08.960]   Are you saying this?
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:09.960]   Do you see what I'm saying?
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:13.000]   The lover of peace will be motivated to make peace.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.360]   He's a man of peace.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.480]   Are you that kind of wise individual?
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.800]   What's more, you're gentle.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.400]   True wisdom is gentle.
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:26.680]   Now what's really interesting is verse 13 had the Greek word prautis, and it meant self-control.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:32.360]   You're like, you have this calm about you because you're solid, right?
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:38.520]   But this is a different word, and the definition entries are things like fair, modest, tolerant,
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:40.120]   considerate.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.960]   I want to turn you to a passage.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.320]   You don't have to turn there for the sake of time.
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.840]   Proverbs 19 verse 11.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:47.800]   It says a person's wisdom yields patience.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:54.160]   It is to one's glory to overlook an offense.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.920]   To overlook an offense.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:03.200]   Have you now exercised some wisdom in your relationships where you're able to understand
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.980]   why is this person weak?
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:09.560]   Maybe it's because they've got 15 things to fix.
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.600]   They're working on three, and you're seeing the whole picture, and you're like, dude,
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.400]   yes, so many things to fix.
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:20.120]   But an understanding person realizes, growing Christian, he's working, look at him.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:25.080]   He's got lots of things to correct, but you understand so you can overlook.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.280]   Do you exercise wisdom like that?
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.480]   Or are you like, no, no, no, you hurt me.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:35.720]   You hurt me in these five ways, and you better pay, right?
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.080]   That's not wise.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.200]   That's not biblical wisdom.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:42.240]   The other one is true wisdom is reasonable.
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:46.220]   Scripture says that an individual who is reasonable is teachable.
[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:48.640]   Scripture says that even leaders need to be reasonable.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:53.440]   What's really interesting is this term for reasonable is often translated submissive.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.440]   But the way I want to describe it to you, because I want to give you a picture, and
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.940]   then it's going to be a test.
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:01.680]   Do you exercise this kind of wisdom?
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:06.840]   Are you able to listen and then be persuaded?
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:14.920]   I picture, on contrast, the older Asian man who's just like, no, I hate vegetables, I'm
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:15.920]   not eating it.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:16.920]   Whatever it may be.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:20.120]   And you're like, no, that is good for you.
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.440]   You can say it's good for me all you want, not doing it.
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.440]   Unpersuadable.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:27.120]   But look, I got, no, I've never done it, not doing it now.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:31.240]   Do you know how frustrating it is when you talk to somebody like that?
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:34.560]   If you've ever been that person where your excuse for not changing was, I've never done
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.840]   it that way.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:39.080]   The person talking to you is being like, fool.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.720]   If it's good for you, it's good for you.
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.240]   What does it matter you've never done it this way?
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.000]   Are you persuadable?
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   Are you reasonable?
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.460]   Or have you put your foot down and said, no, I'm not changing.
[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:54.080]   Not only are you going to be a hard person to deal with in relationships, but you're
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.200]   going to look like the fool.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.160]   You're not listening to good reason.
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.560]   What's more, true wisdom is full of mercy.
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.560]   Why?
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:06.160]   Because the biblical reality is you've been lavish with mercy.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:10.800]   If you want to picture it, God has literally poured out mercy upon you so that your cup
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.840]   overflows.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:18.040]   For you to be stingy with mercy is an absolute hypocrisy.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:20.720]   And scripture says you're blessed when you're merciful.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:23.560]   But another nuanced way to think about mercy is this.
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:28.600]   The terminology was used in 2 Timothy chapter two, verse 24 to 25.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.440]   The scripture says, "The Lord's bond servant must not be quarrelsome.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.440]   He must be kind."
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.600]   Boom, right there.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:41.560]   "He must be kind to all, able to teach patient when wronged, with gentleness correcting those
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.120]   who are in opposition.
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.920]   If perhaps God may grant them repentance, leading to the knowledge of truth."
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:51.600]   What's really interesting is later on, he's going to say, well, he's going to describe
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.840]   the character of a man who could be a leader.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:59.640]   And one of those things is rather than getting everyone back, he is absorbing the wrong of
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.640]   others.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.840]   Isn't that what mercy is?
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:03.840]   You see the crime.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:04.840]   I saw what you did.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:05.840]   Yeah, you did it.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:09.120]   Yeah, it was you, right?
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.280]   Of course you see it.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:13.480]   We see other people's flaws as clear as day.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.560]   Can you be merciful?
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.760]   Are you a person marked by mercy?
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.960]   What's more, scripture says that true wisdom is full of good fruits.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:25.240]   We talked about how your wisdom is going to show in your skill.
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:31.760]   Scripture also says that true wisdom is unwavering, meaning that you are unbiased when you judged.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.000]   You're not wavering by bribes.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.640]   You're not wavering by people and you're not partial.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:40.080]   You're like always like a politician is like, "I think you want to hear this from me, so
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:41.080]   I'm going to say it.
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.040]   I think you're going to get pissed off, so I'm not going to say this."
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:48.760]   If you are constantly trying to predict what you should do to please people, guess what?
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:53.280]   You are going to be the most wavering, double-minded person on the universe.
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.040]   God's wisdom says, "No, you are unwavering."
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.280]   What's more, true wisdom is without hypocrisy.
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:48:59.800]   There's no pretense.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.340]   You should be sincere.
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:02.400]   There's no faking it.
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.400]   There's no acting.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:09.200]   Now, at this point, you might be like, "Wow, we just went through a lot."
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.360]   And I'm going to conclude with that.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:16.280]   God's wisdom that he wants us to grow is a lot.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:19.600]   And if we keep thinking about the perfection of these things, we're thinking about Jesus
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.100]   Christ.
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:25.760]   And that standard is so high.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:30.480]   How many of us can say, "I am really patient."
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:34.520]   How many of us can say, "I'm super merciful, and no, I don't hold wrong."
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.640]   How many of us can say, "There's no hypocrisy in me.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:41.840]   There was never a time when I tried to present myself more godly than I am."
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.360]   You'd be like, "Okay."
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.960]   You can tell when people are lying.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.960]   You'd be like, "Liar."
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.840]   What am I saying right now?
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:57.500]   To be godly in the way of God's wisdom is a lifelong investment.
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:00.920]   And that's why Proverbs chapter four says, "The beginning of wisdom is, yes, the fear
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.360]   of God, but he says, "Here's my number one advice to you.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:04.360]   Get wisdom.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:05.360]   Be a learner."
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.360]   Proverbs chapter one.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.360]   "Don't refuse my teaching.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.360]   Hear and incline your ear.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:09.360]   Listen."
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:16.960]   Proverbs chapter five, and it goes on to this, "Look at wisdom and prize her, guard her,
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.600]   keep her near."
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:22.560]   And so my question to you is this.
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:26.840]   If you've been plateauing and stuff like that, ask yourself, where is your hunger for God
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:29.240]   to instruct you?
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.520]   Where is your hunger for wisdom?
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.860]   There's so much to learn.
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:38.840]   And so that's why verse 18 ends with, "The seed of fruit of righteousness is sown in
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.320]   peace by those who make peace."
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:45.040]   What does that metaphor highlight for you?
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.480]   It's a farmer.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:50.800]   In the off season, when it's cold, you start prepping the ground.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.980]   You lay the seed.
[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.240]   You wait on the Lord.
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:57.160]   You're still prepping this and prepping that, and then you're way patiently, and like a
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:01.240]   master craftsman who knows, "Listen, young man, I know you're impatient with this whole
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:04.180]   process, but sanding takes time.
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:05.700]   Even picking the wood takes time.
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:09.080]   Even the layer of finish and the layer of paint takes time.
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.760]   Even curing all that stuff takes time.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.080]   Piecing it all together takes time.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.440]   Measuring it takes time.
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.840]   All of it takes an immense amount of investment."
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:19.280]   Yes?
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:24.920]   It is wise for us then to dedicate and say, "God, teach me.
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:28.420]   I am here to learn from you."
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:34.160]   This is to us a great, great challenge because regularly, I'm going to be honest, certain
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.640]   moments in life, you're going to assume you're good.
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:41.480]   You're going to assume you know enough, and at least you know more than the people around
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:43.040]   you.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:48.240]   Those are the moments you're a fool because scripture says you will fall.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:54.760]   I want to end with Ephesians chapter five that says this, "Therefore, be careful how
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:56.680]   you walk.
[00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.000]   Stay attentive.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.160]   Be observant.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:02.480]   Stay in tune with your next steps.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.320]   Not as unwise men, but as wise."
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.160]   May we be growing Christians.
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:13.360]   May our Father look at us, not because we're perfect, but he's looking at us like his children.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:16.000]   Maybe we can say teenage children, right?
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.920]   He can see in you, "Look at you.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.880]   You're hungry.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:21.880]   You're open to instruction.
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:24.760]   Yeah, you've got a ton of refining to do.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:31.120]   Yes, out of 15 things, maybe you're only getting three right, but my wise son is listening
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.880]   to the wise words of God."
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:33.520]   Let's pray.
