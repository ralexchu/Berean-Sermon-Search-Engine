[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   [ Applause ]
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.380]   >> Hello. My name is Kevin, Kevin Lee, and this is my testimony.
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.620]   Before conversion, I was lost and gave into many fleshy desires.
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.260]   Often I was jumping from one worldly satisfaction to another,
[00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.640]   and there were really three main things that I idolized.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.300]   None of these things are bad in nature, but the desires of my heart
[00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.800]   and my lack of wisdom led to idolatry.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.680]   The first was woman.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.200]   Growing up, seeing other couples would naturally influence me into wanting a girlfriend.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.820]   When I got into a relationship, that was the thing that I idolized.
[00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.140]   She was the center of my life.
[00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.520]   The second was school.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:02.020]   I was addicted to success and allowed the pursuit of worldly knowledge to take over my life.
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.300]   Lastly, it was my social life.
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:12.440]   I was always a people pleaser and rarely said no to going out, clubbing, drinking.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.360]   I lived my life the way I wanted to because I thought my life was my own.
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.700]   I was blinded by darkness because believing that my life was my own completely contradicted God's word.
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.780]   First Corinthians chapter 6, 19 through 20 says, "Or do you not know that your body is a temple
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.540]   of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God?
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.880]   You are not your own, for you are bought with a price, so glorify God in your body."
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.060]   After not attending church throughout college, I started attending Berean after I graduated.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.980]   I graduated college.
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.460]   Almost unconsciously, I began saying after sermons, attending Bible study,
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.180]   and enrolling in BCC, the basics in Christianity class.
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.440]   Quite frankly, I was surprised.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.060]   This was unlike myself.
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.940]   At one Bible study, there was someone who I got to know, and he hit me with the tough question.
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.220]   Would you consider yourself a Christian?
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.780]   Initially, my answer was yes because I had grown up in a Christian home like many of us.
[00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.420]   But as we kept talking, I quickly realized, no, I was not a Christian.
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.760]   I did not remember the last time I opened up the Bible.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.500]   I lived from my fleshy desires, and I had no idea who God actually was.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.500]   Over the next couple of weeks of reading scripture and just being blown away
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.740]   by the things that God was revealing to me, I was convicted to the point
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.620]   of ending the relationship with my girlfriend at the time.
[00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.680]   She was a nonbeliever.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.120]   And scripture says, "Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers,
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.160]   for what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness,
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.880]   or what fellowship has light with darkness?"
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.780]   2 Corinthians 6.14.
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.300]   She was confused.
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.180]   My friends were -- my unbelieving friends were confused.
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.240]   They were even more confused when I said this was to glorify God.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.820]   But it made so much sense to me because it was the first step in --
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.880]   the first step I took in obeying God.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.800]   I surrendered to my convictions, and I placed faith in Him.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.100]   Another night after Bible study, I was playing ping pong with Pastor Mark.
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.320]   It was quiet.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.780]   And I told him what had happened, and that although I was truly broken,
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.340]   I was eager to know what I needed to do next.
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.900]   Pastor Mark and I prayed that night, asking the Lord for forgiveness.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.200]   I needed to ask for forgiveness because I destroyed my relationship with God.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.100]   Just because I was going to church again didn't mean God and I were on good terms.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.240]   In submission, I asked, "Lord, please set me free from the kingdom of darkness."
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.380]   And really, this was the start of my reconciliation with God and the night of my conversion.
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.120]   Through no other power but His, He gave me the right to become His child.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.260]   And I was filled with joy.
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.500]   No longer was I living for the world.
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.580]   I was now living for the Almighty God.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.240]   And afterwards, Pastor Mark told me that those in heaven are cheering in joy,
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.500]   and that put a big smile on my face.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.700]   After conversion, God has blessed me with an eternal perspective
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.680]   that has killed the silly opinions I held before that I won't go into.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.540]   This eternal perspective has affected every aspect of my life,
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.540]   daily activities, my purpose, my pleasures.
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.340]   By the Holy Spirit, I may now fight to kill the sins and idols that once enslaved me.
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.540]   I feel the joy in fellowshipping with my brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.100]   And most importantly, I'm excited to learn the truths of the Bible
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.100]   and to hear what God has to say to me every day.
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.260]   Looking back at all my defiance to God, it deserved eternity in hell.
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.980]   And that's the truth of it.
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.960]   Despite all of it, God has been present in my life
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.020]   through all the uncles and aunts who stressed the importance of faith,
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.020]   through my parents who never failed to remind me that God comes first,
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.020]   and to my own brother, a younger brother, who prayed for my salvation.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.320]   I know now that Jesus, the perfectly obedient Son of God,
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.320]   took on the Father's wrath for me, the wretched sinner,
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.320]   and for that, I give my life to Him.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.320]   Thank you.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.320]   (Applause)
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:52.320]   - You can sit.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.320]   All right, Kevin, give me your left hand.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.320]   Kevin, do you understand that when you go into the water,
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.320]   you are uniting with Christ in His death,
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.320]   and that when you come out, you're uniting with Him in His resurrection,
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.320]   so that you too may live a new life?
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.320]   - Yes, sir.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.320]   - I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.320]   (Applause)
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.320]   (Cheers)
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.320]   - It's cold, huh?
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:41.320]   (Cheers)
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:49.320]   - Hi, my name is Alyssa Nguyen.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.320]   Actually, I'm kind of scared, so if I cry, sorry.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.320]   (Laughter)
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.320]   I was blessed to have been born into a Christian home
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.320]   and learn about God from a young age.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.320]   I remember going to church every day, or every Sunday,
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.320]   but I thought it was just a place to hang out with friends and eat snacks all the time.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:18.320]   In Sunday school, I thought that these stories about the Bible and God were cool,
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.320]   but I also thought it was something that I just had to learn,
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.320]   something like math or spelling.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:29.320]   As I got into high school, I started to serve more at church,
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:35.320]   but I thought that that was something that I just had to do as a good Christian.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:42.320]   I thought that I could define my own idea of right and wrong,
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:48.320]   that compared to other people, I wasn't a bad person,
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.320]   that I didn't do the things that outwardly seemed bad,
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.320]   that looking at other people, that they did.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.320]   I thought that the mark of a good Christian, yeah, was not doing bad things,
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.320]   but trying to do good or going to all the events and all of that.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.320]   So I had a very small view of what it meant to be good,
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.320]   and I didn't see that I wasn't good on my own.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:18.320]   So as a result of me thinking that I could be good on my own,
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.320]   my own heart was filled with a lot of pride,
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.320]   that in my service, I was taking all the glory for myself,
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:33.320]   and thinking that all the good things I was doing was for myself,
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:41.320]   and that deep down, it was all just in an effort to have people think well of me.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:46.320]   I really idolized how people regarded me,
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.320]   and that was the main motivation for a lot of the things that I did in high school.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:57.320]   And yeah, I didn't want to see or acknowledge the fact that I was a sinner,
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:03.320]   and at the same time of not wanting to acknowledge the fact that I was a sinner,
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:08.320]   I saw how I continued to struggle with different things,
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.320]   just an inability to be patient,
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.320]   especially with regards to my family.
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:27.320]   I saw that on my own, I couldn't refrain from doing these things.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.320]   And so the summer after my senior year of college, I think my brother came home,
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.320]   and on the outside he looked the same, same guy,
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.320]   but I saw how he had changed in the little ways of being disciplined,
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:49.320]   in his prayer and devos, and that was something that I hadn't seen before,
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.320]   and it was something that I wanted for myself as well,
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:58.320]   but I also wanted to continue to hold on to that idea that I could be good on my own.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.320]   In college I started to learn more church,
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.320]   and started to see the gospel even more fully,
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.320]   and that I saw who God was and is,
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.320]   that he is holy and perfect and just God,
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.320]   and that I saw who I was before God.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:25.320]   I truly saw that I was a sinner, that I wasn't good on my own,
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.320]   that I was in need of a savior,
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:35.320]   that I was an enemy of God in the ways that I live for myself and for my own glory.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:41.320]   And it was during this time, just learning all of these things,
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.320]   that God revealed to me my sinful nature,
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.320]   and through his grace and mercy,
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.320]   he humbled me in my pride, allowing me to see all these things,
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:58.320]   that it wasn't by my own ideas of being good that I was saved,
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.320]   but only through Christ.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.320]   And so I repented of my sins,
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.320]   and began to acknowledge Christ as Lord over my life.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.320]   It was during this year that I saw the beauty of the gospel,
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:21.320]   that sinners like me can be forgiven, redeemed, and adopted through Christ in his life, death, and resurrection.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:27.320]   And after this, I saw a change in the way that I was able to view my family,
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:32.320]   that I was able to fight these sins of anger and impatience,
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.320]   something that I was not able to do before,
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.320]   because before I was enslaved to these sins,
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:46.320]   but now with the Holy Spirit, I was able to respond in love and patience to them.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.320]   So yeah, I'm so thankful to God,
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.320]   to how he has continued to be faithful in my life,
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:58.320]   and just allowing me to see him and my need for a savior.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.320]   And it says in Galatians 2.20,
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.320]   "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.320]   And the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God,
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.320]   who loved me and gave himself up for me."
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.320]   Thank you.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:22.320]   [applause]
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:27.320]   It's a little cold.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.320]   All right, give me your left hand, Melissa.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.320]   You all right there? Okay.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.320]   Melissa, do you understand that when you go into the water,
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.320]   you're uniting with Christ in his death,
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.320]   and when you come out of the water, you're uniting with him in his resurrection?
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.320]   Yes.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.320]   Okay.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:51.320]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:13:16.320]   [applause]
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.320]   Hi. Oh, this is tall.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:25.320]   For those of you that don't know me, my name's Abby.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.320]   I'm from San Francisco.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.320]   I grew up in a pretty conservative Chinese church.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:37.320]   We have one grand piano and a lot of hymnaries.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:42.320]   But, yeah, so this is my testimony.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.320]   I previously believed that I was saved around the third grade,
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.320]   that I prayed this prayer of salvation,
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:55.320]   and though sometimes I felt unsure, all that was on my mind was "once saved, always saved."
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.320]   This prayer of salvation was based on Romans 9-10,
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.320]   that if you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord,
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.320]   and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.320]   With the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness,
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.320]   and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.320]   This part in verse 10, "Jesus as Lord," meaning Jesus as your master,
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.320]   as the one who you live to serve,
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:24.320]   I don't think I truly understood the meaning of what I was praying, or the weight.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:29.320]   It was during the beginning of my study of James here, in like October,
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.320]   that first prompted me to question when I was saved.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:37.320]   Specifically, James 1-26, "If anyone thinks himself to be religious,
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.320]   and yet does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own heart,
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.320]   this man's religion is worthless."
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:47.320]   I read this, and I was kind of like, "Oh shoot, that kind of sounds like me."
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:52.320]   It was really making me reflect on the way I was living my life,
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.320]   and the motivations behind my decisions.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.320]   I was thinking back to high school, or even prior to high school,
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.320]   I know that I never bridled my tongue when I was angry,
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.320]   which was a lot of the time.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.320]   I definitely was very vocal about it.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.320]   I would grumble a lot, I would slander others.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.320]   Just thinking about who I was in high school, and how clear-cut this verse is,
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.320]   really made me do a lot of thinking, and made me realize
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:25.320]   that I did not truly confess Jesus as my Lord, or as my master.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:30.320]   I realized that I lived life as a nominal Christian,
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.320]   under the title of Christian, while my actions said otherwise.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.320]   I lived for myself. I did things for my own glory and pride,
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.320]   and for my own benefit.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:48.320]   I never really saw fault in myself because of those things.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:52.320]   I rarely ever apologized for anything, and I wasn't reading his word,
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.320]   or praying, nor did I care to at the time.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:00.320]   In Judges 17.6, it says, "In those days, there was no king in Israel,
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.320]   and every man did what was right in his own eyes."
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:08.320]   That is how I was living, not recognizing Jesus as my true king.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:16.320]   After 18 years of being a professed believer, I knew that I did not know God.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.320]   Through all this living in sin, God was never on my mind,
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.320]   throughout my day or week.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.320]   I was really content with my life, which I felt was separate from God.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:32.320]   This life that I thought was a result of my own works and efforts,
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.320]   I did not attribute to God any of it.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:41.320]   I don't believe I ever truly confessed or repented any sin that I committed.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.320]   I remember going to all these conferences and retreats,
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.320]   and feeling this spiritual high,
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:52.320]   praying and confessing these sins of ignoring God or not reading.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:59.320]   However, when I returned back to, for lack of better words, the real world,
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:06.320]   my life didn't look any different than it did before I went to the conference,
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.320]   or it probably changed for like two days.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.320]   Living my life with this false notion that I did not need God
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:19.320]   contributed to a big sin that I struggle with, which is pride.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:22.320]   My first two weeks of college were pretty difficult for me,
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.320]   academically and socially.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:29.320]   I wasn't understanding any of my basic courses for my major,
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.320]   and my non-believing roommates, which I chose,
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:39.320]   were fulfilling their earthly desires that may not have been so legal
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.320]   in the dorm room at 3 a.m.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.320]   It was pretty loud on school nights.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.320]   It was really hard to sleep.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.320]   I have videos if you want to see them later.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:59.320]   I had never felt such feelings of loneliness and inadequacy that deeply before,
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.320]   but I am really thankful to the Lord for that experience
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.320]   because it was then that I truly turned to the Lord
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.320]   and saw my helplessness and my brokenness
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.320]   and realized that my identity in Christ is more than sufficient.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.320]   I remember my first service here,
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.320]   I think it was the second to last message before Pastor Peter left for India.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.320]   It was about the wheat and the tares,
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.320]   and I think he said something like this.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.320]   If he didn't, sorry.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.320]   But I think he said something like,
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.320]   "Sometimes the wide way is to keep going to church
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.320]   if that's what you've been doing your whole life."
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.320]   And just remembering that makes me so thankful that God revealed himself to me
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.320]   and opened my eyes to the sin that is in me
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.320]   and that I didn't continue this path of thinking that I was on the narrow way,
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.320]   when in fact I was headed for destruction.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.320]   During that experience, in my first couple weeks here,
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.320]   my eyes were truly opened to how nothing is of my own works
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.320]   and that everything is by God's grace and mercy.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.320]   He humbled me, and I believe that I experienced true reconciliation with Christ
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.320]   through the repentance of my pride.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:06.320]   I believe that that is the moment that I truly acknowledge Jesus as the master of my life.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.320]   I remember in table groups on a Friday night,
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:15.320]   we talked about how we need to make sure our reliance on Jesus is not based on emotion.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.320]   This again got me thinking because the experience was very fresh.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:23.320]   I wanted to make sure that I was acknowledging Jesus as my master,
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.320]   not just because my circumstances were really difficult,
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.320]   but I did come to see how easy it was to rely on God
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:33.320]   when my earthly circumstances were harder or didn't go my way.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:38.320]   But I was reminded that God isn't like a safety net that is only useful if I fall.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.320]   He is God Almighty.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.320]   He doesn't need us, and there is nothing that we can offer him
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.320]   or that he would need that he cannot achieve himself within the blink of an eye.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:53.320]   Yet he loves us and cares for us so much that he sent his only son to be mocked and spat upon,
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.320]   put to death in the most humiliating and gruesome way.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.320]   It is because of God's unfathomable love that I am able to stand here
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:05.320]   and proclaim that I have died to my former self and now live this new life in Christ.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:15.320]   [applause]
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:23.320]   All right, Abbey, give me your left hand.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.320]   Abbey, do you understand that when you go into the water,
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.320]   you're uniting with Christ in his death, and when you're coming out,
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.320]   you're uniting with him in his resurrection so that you too can live a new life?
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:40.320]   Okay, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:55.320]   [applause]
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:05.320]   [applause]
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:10.320]   Hi, my name is Joe, and my Chinese name is Fang Qizhou.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:22.320]   I grew up in China, and I came to the United States in 2016.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:32.320]   My mom converted to Christianity at that time, but I haven't heard anything about the gospel before I came here.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:40.320]   I agree with her about the existence of God and supernatural beings,
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:45.320]   but I don't think I have anything to do with the one who created me.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:53.320]   He just has authority over me and everything else that he created.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:59.320]   Growing up as the only child, the world was all about myself.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:05.320]   As a self-conscious person, I didn't care about others at all,
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:13.320]   but I pretended to be considerate and nice to others so that they would speak highly of me.
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:18.320]   I felt jealous of those who were more popular than I am.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:24.320]   I hated them and slandered them when I was behind them.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:32.320]   When I was in junior high school in China, I often showed off how smart I was
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:37.320]   by talking endlessly during class discussions.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:47.320]   One day I was enjoying others' worshiping, amazement, and appreciation of how much I knew.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:56.320]   However, other students who equally wanted to look smart and become popular
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:02.320]   interrupted me and shouted loudly,
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:08.320]   "You don't have the right to speak because you are not a good student,"
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.320]   parenthesis, "than I do, than me."
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:18.320]   Afterwards, I discovered a conflict.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:23.320]   I seek out my own glory, so do others.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:32.320]   I realized I hurt others while pursuing my own reputation the same way they did to me.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:38.320]   Then I began to reserve my opinions and distrust people,
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:43.320]   for I knew they don't really care about me.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:50.320]   When I came to the U.S. as an international student, I felt increasingly left out.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:56.320]   It turned out that although I missed my friends,
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:03.320]   they don't really consider me as part of their life that they couldn't afford to lose.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:10.320]   I felt no one loves me except for myself,
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:19.320]   but even myself hated just me most of the time.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.320]   Because I noticed my hypocrisy.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:28.320]   I'm being selfish while acting to make people think I'm altruistic,
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:33.320]   being arrogant while trying to make people think I'm humble.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:38.320]   I began to refuse talking with people, even if I had to.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:43.320]   I talked sarcastically and aggressively.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:48.320]   I felt hopeless. I lost my passions and my goals.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:55.320]   The only thing I was sure about my life was death, which would happen sooner or later.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:05.320]   I had to escape reality by playing video games excessively.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:13.320]   Last April, my bike was stolen, and I was sitting on a bench trying to recall where I lost it.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   A staff from Bridges, his name is Justin, he's here.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:28.320]   He came to ask if I was okay, and he invited me to his home for their Friday dinner,
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:34.320]   which is for international students.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:41.320]   People are nice at Bridges, which is the name for their ministry,
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:51.320]   and I get to truly act as if I'm at home, even though I'm not at home.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:55.320]   At the dinner, a student shared her testimony.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:01.320]   She said we are all sentenced to death, which I totally agree with.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:08.320]   However, she told us that Christ died in our place and took the punishment for us
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:17.320]   so that we don't need to die anymore, and our relationship with God is restored through Christ.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:22.320]   I thought my relationship with the supernatural being was not restorable,
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:27.320]   for I thought I was unworthy, but when I heard there is life,
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:34.320]   my hope was reignited, and I no longer felt I was living in a nightmare of fear,
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:39.320]   of the fear of death every day.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:44.320]   I also wondered why other Christians seemed to care about me.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:52.320]   I thought it was impossible for them to care about me unless they are loved by their God,
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:27:00.320]   and I can see their prayers for me are sincere.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:08.320]   As I learned more about God, I began to know that I was not the abandoned kid I thought I was.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:14.320]   Even though the world would love its own, John 15, 19,
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:19.320]   God loves me, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son,
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:26.320]   that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life, John 3, 16.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:37.320]   Although I didn't deserve anything, it's only his grace which is far greater than all my brokenness,
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:43.320]   and then I decided to follow him and see how deep he loves us.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:50.320]   As I understand more about how holy and faithful God is,
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:57.320]   in contrast to how unbelieving and ungrateful I am, I began to appreciate God's love more.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   I became more willing to admit my weaknesses and trust God more.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:10.320]   I am able to love others without thinking too much how they will repay me,
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:18.320]   and able to love those who are hard to love because that is how I am loved by God.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.320]   I don't slander other people behind them.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:27.320]   I'm not willing to talk with people and build relationships with them
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:32.320]   and spread the love I receive from God.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:39.320]   Although sometimes I feel the hate and distrust inside myself still,
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:47.320]   but I can pray to God and appeal to him, for I trust that he is the one who is in power.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:57.320]   [applause]
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:03.320]   [applause]
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.320]   Alright, Chi-Jo.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.320]   Go ahead and take a seat.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.320]   Take my left hand.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.320]   Chi-Jo, do you understand that when you go into the water, you're uniting with Christ in his death,
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:19.320]   and when you come out of the water, you're uniting with him in his resurrection,
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.320]   so that you too may live a new life?
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:32.320]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:59.320]   [applause]
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:06.320]   Hi, my name is Kaitlyn, if you guys don't know me, and this is my testimony.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:12.320]   Being born into a Christian family, I've always had the privilege of going to church every week,
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.320]   but honestly, I never really saw it as a privilege.
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:20.320]   I always identified as a Christian, but I didn't really know what that meant
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:25.320]   other than going to church on a daily basis and believing that God was real.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:29.320]   Throughout elementary school, I had seen church as more of a chore,
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.320]   and sometimes just a fun place to be at.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:36.320]   I struggled in a big church because I couldn't recognize people,
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:40.320]   and I was always disinterested in the actual lessons that were being taught.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:46.320]   After we moved and came to Berean, it was a shock to me how small the youth department was.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:51.320]   At the time, the lessons seemed so much more personal, as there was only a few kids,
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:55.320]   and I enjoyed going to church and took in whatever was being taught.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.320]   However, this feeling was short-lived as middle school came around,
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.320]   and I began seeing church as a chore once more.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.320]   Although I didn't mind going as much, I also didn't care about missing
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.320]   and sometimes even tried to skip Friday nights or Sundays.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:11.320]   Going into senior year, I became pretty distant from my school friends,
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:19.320]   and I tried to rely only on myself when I ran into any problems.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:24.320]   Although I had asked some church friends to pray for me whenever I ran into difficulty,
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:30.320]   I never really prayed to God or asked him to help me in any of my problems.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:34.320]   I tried not to act like it and refused to believe it,
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.320]   but I had become very self-reliant and prideful.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:44.320]   I wanted to help out as much as possible--oh, sorry.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.320]   Later on, my parents had decided to open a ramen shop,
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:51.320]   and I was really excited for them and also for myself.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:56.320]   I wanted to help out as much as possible, and seeing the amount of work they had put in,
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.320]   I also wanted to work hard.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.320]   But I ran into a lot of problems and eventually found myself
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:10.320]   complaining about the other workers and--sorry--
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:17.320]   and how my parents had handled things.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:22.320]   My pride had gotten the better of me as I tried to make things my own
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:31.320]   and made a lot of selfish choices.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:35.320]   One night after work--for those of you that don't know,
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:41.320]   I really like talking to my parents about everything that happens during the day.
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:48.320]   But that night I had just been complaining pretty much about one of the workers
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:54.320]   and kind of slandering her and just talking bad about her.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:59.320]   My mom had pointed out that I had absolutely no reason to dislike her.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.320]   She hadn't really done anything to me.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.320]   It was just certain things like how she was working
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:09.320]   or her relationship with the other workers.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:15.320]   She questioned me why I was so focused on making only her look bad,
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:21.320]   and that made me feel really uncomfortable, being told so directly about my flaws.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:27.320]   It had consumed my mind.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:31.320]   I realized why I had been so quick to bash on her
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:34.320]   and why I was so focused on her bad side.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.320]   It made me really frustrated.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:40.320]   On my way home from school the next day,
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:46.320]   I still had been thinking about these thoughts all day long.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:55.320]   On the car ride home, I finally thought just how sinful my heart really was
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:34:01.320]   and how much anger and just sin was in it.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:06.320]   It was such a simple statement that my heart was full of sin,
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:11.320]   and yet my pride was hit really badly.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.320]   I began to feel so much shame and guilt.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:19.320]   But at that moment, I praised God for just being so gracious to me.
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:24.320]   I see I used that moment to really break me down.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:30.320]   I finally turned to him for help and really came before him,
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:37.320]   just asking for help and just being so thankful for him.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:47.320]   Halfway through the car ride, I began to cry, which is really scary while driving.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:52.320]   I was really thankful there was traffic, so then there was a lot of stopping.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:59.320]   But because of that traffic, I had so much more time just to think and reflect on myself.
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:03.320]   At the same time, just really ask God for forgiveness.
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:15.320]   I used that time to just pray for him for help because I had realized how useless I was.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:22.320]   Just kind of reflecting on all the past lessons I've heard of, all the sermons that I've been taught,
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:29.320]   really was helpful for me.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:39.320]   I was so thankful for him sending his son because only through Christ I had already been forgiven.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.320]   Although this was a truth I've heard pretty much all my life,
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:47.320]   I never really rejected the idea, but I never really accepted it either.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:52.320]   But in that moment, it just felt so real and very close to heart.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:56.320]   It was like a big slap in the face.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:05.320]   All my life I've been hearing the gospel, and yet I always refused Christ as my Lord and Savior,
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:11.320]   and yet he still had the mercy to reach down to me and save me.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:16.320]   In Colossians 1, 21-22, it says,
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:21.320]   "And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, engaged in evil deeds,
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:27.320]   yet he has now reconciled in you his freshly body through death in order to present you before him
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.320]   holy and blameless and beyond reproach."
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:35.320]   It was so crazy to me that despite how much sin I had, Christ had made it possible to reconcile with God.
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:39.320]   And understanding and accepting that Christ is the only one who can save me,
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:46.320]   I think I also had great relief in that moment that nothing I could do would have been able to redeem myself.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.320]   Even though I tried so hard to be a good person and a good Christian,
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:53.320]   seeing how far from God I am and how much sin filled my heart,
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.320]   I'm so thankful that it's not up to my works or anything that I do.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.320]   In Romans 3, 23, it says,
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:05.320]   "For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God and are justified by his grace as a gift
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.320]   through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.320]   After all that, although I still had a difficult time dealing with sin,
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.320]   God truly changed my heart, attitude, and mindset.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:20.320]   I think our Friday night table group had hit it right on the nail when we discussed that
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:26.320]   although we still sin, for us as Christians, it is a struggle.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:33.320]   And I wasn't, after that, I wasn't just cruising along with sin and just allowing it to just take over my life.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:38.320]   Now I'm like, I'm struggling with it and trying to fight back.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:44.320]   And I'm very thankful that God has been with me and has just really blessed me throughout my life.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:51.320]   Even now, I'm very scared of public speaking, and yet I have confidence to share the gospel.
[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.320]   As it says in one of my favorite verses,
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:59.320]   "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes,
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:05.320]   to the Jew first and also to the Greek." And that's in Romans 1:16.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.320]   Thank you.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:16.320]   [Applause]
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.320]   Do you understand that when you go into the water, you're uniting with Christ in His death,
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.320]   and when you're coming out, you're uniting with Him in His resurrection,
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.320]   so that you can walk in newness alive.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:43.320]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:58.320]   [Applause]
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:10.320]   [Applause]
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.320]   Hi everyone. My name is Amber.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:19.320]   For those of you who don't know me, I've been a member here at Berean for about four or five years.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:25.320]   And if you're wondering how I've not been baptized, well, I have the privilege of sharing that with you today.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:29.320]   Hopefully it will be a source of encouragement and God will be glorified through it.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:34.320]   So I grew up in a Presbyterian church. I was baptized as an infant and raised in the church.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:39.320]   I think for me, and I'm sure a lot of people who grow up in the church have a hard time
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.320]   discerning what it means to be a genuine believer.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:46.320]   Every week it was a consistent pattern of just going to church with family,
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:51.320]   and my understanding of being a Christian was just doing that, just going to church.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.320]   I was very unaware of my sins.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   Not that I believed I was perfect or anything, but there was just no genuine fight or struggle against it.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.320]   On top of that, I was just very self-righteous.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:08.320]   I took a lot of pride in having the title of being a Christian,
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:13.320]   and I even looked down on those who didn't know Christ, although I myself didn't know Him personally either.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:17.320]   For example, I have this one distinct memory from fourth grade.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:22.320]   I had this classmate who was Jewish, and I just looked over and told her,
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:25.320]   "You're going to hell because you don't believe in Jesus."
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:29.320]   And then she started crying, and then I got sent to the principal's office.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:36.320]   And then I told my principal, you know, I was just sharing the gospel with her, and then I got released.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.320]   [laughter]
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:42.320]   I think just that silly example just sheds light to my self-righteousness
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:47.320]   and how skewed my understanding of my own spiritual condition was.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:51.320]   My assurance of salvation at the time just came from, you know,
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:55.320]   just coming from a family who were Christians and by external works,
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:58.320]   like going to church, trying to read the Bible, and praying.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.320]   But I think God really just used a difficult childhood for me to humble me
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.320]   and to show me that being a Christian isn't by heritage or any type of external works,
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:11.320]   but really by having faith and knowing Him personally and finding life and joy in Him.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:17.320]   I lost my father traumatically at a very early age, and my family suffered a lot of financial hardships.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.320]   And I think just generally for me, I lost hope.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:27.320]   I was very unhappy with my circumstances and had a hard time just accepting that all of it was fair.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.320]   Shortly before I entered high school was one of the most difficult times for us,
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:34.320]   and having come to such a low point of my life for the first time,
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:39.320]   I actually got on my knees and prayed and asked the Lord to help me have faith.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.320]   I acknowledged God and His holiness.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:44.320]   I understood His ultimate power and authority over my life
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:49.320]   and realized that it wasn't by my works or heritage that makes me a believer,
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.320]   but by placing trust and faith in Him.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.320]   Gradually from there, I had a desire to know the Lord deeper,
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:00.320]   and I slowly started to recognize that I was a broken and sinful person who needed a Savior,
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:06.320]   not just to pull me out of difficult circumstances, but rather to be my source of life and joy,
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.320]   so that no matter what happens, I have something greater to hope in,
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.320]   and I knew only Christ could fulfill that.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:17.320]   Philippians 3, 8, "I count all things to be lost in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord,
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:22.320]   for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish, so that I may gain Christ."
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.320]   There really is no life, hope, or joy outside of Christ,
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:30.320]   and I am so blessed and grateful that God chose to reveal those truths to me.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:35.320]   So, fast forward 10 years, which brings us to why I'm getting baptized now.
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:40.320]   I had mentioned earlier that I grew up in a Presbyterian church, and I was infant baptized.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:48.320]   I got confirmed later as a genuine believer, and at the time, I believed that that was my baptism.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:52.320]   Once I came to a Baptist church, I realized baptism was done differently,
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:59.320]   but I hadn't given much thought further than that, because I knew I was saved at the time of my confirmation.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:03.320]   However, it wasn't until a couple months ago when I was asked by my brother-in-law,
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:09.320]   who is a pastor who practices infant baptism, why I decided not to get baptized by immersion,
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.320]   if that's what my church practices and believes.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:17.320]   I couldn't really give an articulate answer, because I had no confidence in what I believed.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.320]   I really just wasn't sure.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:24.320]   And aside from knowing I was a genuine believer at the time of my confirmation,
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:29.320]   I never really questioned if my infant baptism counted as a true baptism or not,
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:33.320]   and I didn't have any personal conviction to be immersed.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.320]   I think from that point on, I realized I needed to do my research
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.320]   and look to Scripture to come to my own terms of what I believed.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:44.320]   Although I wish I had done this much earlier, I was thankful to be challenged in this way,
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:48.320]   to use this opportunity to practice searching the Scripture to see what was true,
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:54.320]   rather than kind of passively accepting and blindly believing what the church does.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:58.320]   And as overwhelming as it was looking into the theology behind both views,
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:05.320]   I knew this was important for me to study, because it would ultimately dictate how I view and interpret the Word.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:09.320]   So to put what I ultimately concluded from all of this into concise terms,
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:12.320]   my conviction comes from Romans 6, 3-4, which says,
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:18.320]   "Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into his death?
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:22.320]   Therefore, we have been buried with him through baptism into death,
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.320]   so that as Christ was raised from the death through the glory of the Father,
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.320]   we too might have walk in newness of life."
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:33.320]   So if baptism is given as a sign to represent being united with Christ in his death,
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.320]   and united with Christ in his resurrection,
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:41.320]   it should have not been given to me as an infant when I was not united with Christ.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:45.320]   Therefore, I cannot confidently say my infant baptism was a true baptism.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.320]   So out of obedience and out of personal conviction,
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:53.320]   I'm excited to stand here to get baptized for the first time through immersion
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:56.320]   and proclaim to you all that I am living a committed life to Christ.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.320]   That's all. Thanks.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:08.320]   [applause]
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:15.320]   Alright, yeah.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:18.320]   Alright, Amber.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:22.320]   Do you understand that when you go into the water, you're uniting with Christ in his death,
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.320]   and as you come out, you're uniting with him in his resurrection?
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:32.320]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:56.320]   [applause]
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:02.320]   Hi, my name's Joanna, and I'm going to share my testimony.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:06.320]   I was born in a Christian family and grew up going to church for most of my life.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:11.320]   The image of God I had in the beginning was of someone who was a spiritual figure
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.320]   that would take care of me and love me.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.320]   He was someone who would be there for me only when I needed him most.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:20.320]   I thought of my relationship with God as being more of,
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:24.320]   if I did my part of the job, then he would do his.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:29.320]   I did not have much communication with him, but it was much more of a work relationship.
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:34.320]   I knew who God was and learned about him every Sunday at church.
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:38.320]   I spent my college years living as a Christian by going to church,
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:41.320]   joining a fellowship, and reading the Bible.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:45.320]   But most of the time, my spiritual motivation came in waves.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:49.320]   Sometimes I was very active, and sometimes I was not.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:53.320]   Being young and wanting to have a lot of ambitions and goals for the future
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:57.320]   made me realize that my purpose was not to live for myself.
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:01.320]   The world I lived in, which I always thought was amazing
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:05.320]   because it offered me many opportunities to achieve my goals and desires,
[00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:09.320]   appeared broken when I found out it was covered with sins.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:12.320]   I thought since I lived as a Christian for many years
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:18.320]   and was a better person than most in the world, I was saved from all the brokenness.
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:21.320]   But I realized I still lived in the broken world
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:26.320]   and was a sinner like everyone else who looked for worldly things to find satisfaction.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:30.320]   Jesus was the only one who could save me from my brokenness,
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:36.320]   only I still was separated from God because I did not know how I could be with Christ.
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:40.320]   I continued to live my life thinking I was a believer and knew what the gospel meant,
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:44.320]   not realizing there was so much I didn't know.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:50.320]   In around fall of 2019, I started to realize the meaning of the gospel and what it meant to me.
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.320]   Admitting that I was a sinner and didn't deserve the love of Christ,
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:57.320]   the fact that Jesus died on the cross and conquered death,
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:01.320]   made me realize that there was no one greater than him.
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:06.320]   I was very unworthy of everything he gave me because I mostly took advantage of things.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:12.320]   The only way for me to be with Christ was to reconcile my relationship with God
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:15.320]   that was broken from all the sins I had committed.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:19.320]   I said a prayer to confess my sins and ask God to accept me.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:23.320]   After becoming a believer, I felt a heavy weight that was lifted.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:28.320]   I felt secure in Christ and knew that my relationship had been restored.
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:32.320]   I now know what my purpose is as a believer and try to live my life
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:36.320]   communicating and strengthening my relationship with him every day.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:45.320]   [applause]
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:49.320]   Alright, Joanna.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:52.320]   Go ahead and give me your left hand and then take a seat.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:56.320]   Joanna, do you understand that when you go into the water, you're uniting with Christ in his death,
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:00.320]   and as you come out, you're uniting with him in his resurrection?
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:10.320]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:31.320]   [applause]
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:37.320]   So I'm just going to read, but bear with me because I didn't read as a kid.
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.320]   [laughter]
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:45.320]   So my name is David, and I've been coming to Berean since November of 2018.
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:50.320]   Priscilla and I had visited Berean several times as visitors from Tucson,
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.320]   and we really enjoy the teachings here.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:58.320]   So when we finally moved to California, we didn't have a reason to look elsewhere.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:04.320]   We anticipated the transition to be difficult, since we both were used to our small church in Tucson
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:07.320]   where everyone knew everyone else.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:15.320]   I thank God for connecting us to Berean, and we're truly grateful for all the Bereans who welcomed us with open arms.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:19.320]   To tell you about how I came to Christ, I grew up in a Christian home.
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:27.320]   We'd have Bible study every night, singing worship songs, and recite the Lord's Prayer, and say grace every meal.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:33.320]   I practically grew up at church, spending most of my Saturdays and Sundays with the church choir
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.320]   and watching my parents serve at church.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:40.320]   And I think because of this, it was always challenging for me to share my testimony,
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.320]   since I'd never really had a road to Damascus moment.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:52.320]   It wasn't until I left my first stable job, I can truly say, I sensed Christ leading and guiding over my heart and my life.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:59.320]   My parents struggled financially when I was attending college, so I also had a lot of student loans.
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:08.320]   There was a constant fear around money, and that I would not be able to support my future family, let alone myself.
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:13.320]   So when I think about the time I left my first full-time job in North Carolina,
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:20.320]   packed all my things from my parents' place, drove 30-plus hours to marry Priscilla, who was studying in Arizona,
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:26.320]   I can now say that Christ led me to Priscilla and our marriage, but back then I was just being young and fearless.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:37.320]   I was finally on my own, away from my earthly parents and away from free housing and being financially more responsible.
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:45.320]   But Christ really took the wheel as he introduced me to a community of believers, got me plugged in to church.
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:52.320]   Things I really wasn't praying for at the time, but he knew exactly what I needed to grow as a man leading a family.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:52:02.320]   It was then I truly knew after 20-plus some years growing up in the church that he truly is the Lord and the ruler of my heart.
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:07.320]   I can't remember when I had ever been baptized by immersion.
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:16.320]   I attended several churches growing up because I just followed my parents and didn't really think much of it when we moved from church to church.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:22.320]   I want to say that I mostly attended Presbyterian churches and I can only guess that I had been sprinkled as a baby.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:26.320]   And I do vaguely remember being confirmed in middle school.
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:34.320]   Spent the last seven years at a Southern Baptist church where they required members to be baptized by immersion before they can serve.
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:40.320]   But somehow I ended up serving as a music director for the three, four years without being asked to get baptized.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:47.320]   And not that it was something I refused to do, but I also didn't feel strongly about the difference to speak up
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:52.320]   because I didn't think I needed a second baptism to prove my faith to anyone.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:53:00.320]   After the recent members meeting, Berean's meeting, I felt the conviction to speak up, realizing how prideful I was,
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:04.320]   selling short the symbolic meaning of baptism.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:12.320]   Colossians chapter 2 verse 12 reads, "Having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith,
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:22.320]   in the powerful working of God who raised him from the dead, this burial and cleansing which signifies death to the old life of unbelief
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:29.320]   and purifying from pollution of sin, not only I found baptism powerful but biblical."
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:41.320]   Second Timothy chapter 3 verse 16 reads, "All scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness."
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:50.320]   Not only was I prideful in thinking that I didn't have to follow baptism the way it was written in the Bible to somehow validate my salvation,
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:56.320]   but I was also wrong to believe in my own interpretation of the scriptures without truly studying the Bible.
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:05.320]   Priscilla is baptized, and I hope that as the head of the family, I can be a spiritual leader of the family and not become a stumbling block.
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:12.320]   I look forward to celebrating and experiencing the rekindling of love to God for all he has done for me
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:17.320]   in making me part of the new covenant in Christ through repentance and faith. Thank you.
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:26.320]   [applause]
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:36.320]   Alright, David, go ahead and take a seat.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:39.320]   And then, just give me your left hand.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:44.320]   David, do you understand that when you go into the water, you're uniting with Christ in his death,
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:50.320]   and when you come out, you're uniting with him in his resurrection so that you may continue just to walk in the newness of life?
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:58.320]   I baptize you—not yet. I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:12.320]   [applause]
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:30.320]   [applause]
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:36.320]   Hi, I'm Brenna. I'm a junior in college, and I've been attending Berean for, I think, two and a half years,
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:40.320]   and I've been a member for a little over a year.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:49.320]   Like many people here, I was baptized once before in a way that didn't really count,
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:56.320]   and so I felt convicted to be baptized again in a way that truly reflects what Christ has done for me.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:00.320]   I grew up going to church because my family went, and that was what we did,
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:04.320]   but I think my heart was hardened against the gospel from a pretty early age.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:09.320]   I had no genuine love for the people in my life, especially my family.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:16.320]   As a kid, whenever I'd get in trouble, which was a lot, and my mom would reprimand me and point me to a Bible verse,
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:23.320]   I would outwardly nod my head and listen, but on the inside roll my eyes and just kind of hate the way that she preached to me.
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:26.320]   Sorry, Mom. [laughter]
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:34.320]   I was a smart kid and a good student, and that was kind of dangerous for me because I let that feed my enormous sense of pride.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:41.320]   For as long as I can remember, I was constantly comparing myself to others and judging myself to be superior to everyone.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:52.320]   As I got older, I was bitter, I was angry, I was selfish, and I knew those things, but I didn't really see a problem with that.
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:58.320]   I stayed in church because youth group was fun, and it was my main way of socializing,
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:04.320]   and I was baptized around the age of 14 because I think all my friends had been baptized,
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:10.320]   and I figured I might as well do it, and a youth staffer had approached me and asked me if I had been baptized,
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:14.320]   so I kind of just did it out of an obligation.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:20.320]   Even though I constantly wavered between thoughts of belief and unbelief, I was baptized anyway and just kept living my life.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:29.320]   Things started to change when I was like 15. My health basically just took a nosedive.
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:36.320]   I would eventually be diagnosed and learn to manage my symptoms, but before that happened, I just got worse and worse,
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:46.320]   with no answers and no diagnosis, and when my body was just failing like that, I think my mind just started to follow,
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:54.320]   and I became severely depressed. People knew that I was going through something, but nobody really knew what it was
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:58:03.320]   because I just built my identity around being arrogant and just isolating myself and relying only on myself and keeping secrets,
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:09.320]   and I had spent so long either using people for my own gain or just pushing them away for the sake of my own privacy and pride
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:16.320]   that I didn't know how to reach out to others to get help, and I was too broken to keep relying on myself.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:20.320]   I didn't understand it at the time, but this brokenness was God's grace.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:27.320]   He had to drive me to a point of utter despair so that I would see my need for him.
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:33.320]   As I was consumed by illness and depression, I felt that nothing I had done or would ever do mattered.
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:43.320]   I wasn't even sure if I would live past 20. Nothing brought me joy. I hardly ate. I stopped going out with friends.
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:51.320]   I was just empty. I kept up a facade of faithful churchgoer and A student because I felt like I had to,
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:59.320]   but I was just crumbling away inside. I thought there was no reason why I should continue to exist if my existence was so worthless.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:08.320]   It kind of all peaked about four years ago. I was 17. I had a depressive episode so acute.
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:15.320]   It was one of the most terrifying things I've ever been through. I don't really have the words to describe how it felt.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:24.320]   I kind of just felt like I wasn't real anymore. I was numb, and I could see that my life was futile,
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:30.320]   but I had this overwhelming sense of urgency, like I had to do something right then and there.
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:35.320]   But at the same time, I felt trapped and stifled by something that I could not name.
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:41.320]   It was a very bizarre experience. It was terrifying. I'm no medical professional, but I may have been having a nervous breakdown.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:52.320]   I don't know. Yeah. So in order to suppress that panic, I just laid down on my floor and turned on some random music
[00:59:52.320 --> 01:00:01.320]   just to distract myself or, I don't know, just to try to get myself to feel normal again.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:09.320]   And in God's great mercy, he allowed me to hear the gospel through the words of a songwriter who had been just as lost as I was.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:16.320]   And when I heard the message of a God who died for the sake of love, it kind of just broke me,
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:22.320]   even though I'd heard the gospel a thousand times before, for some reason this time it clicked.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:29.320]   I had come to a crossroads. I understood there was—it was like there was a hand extended to me,
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:36.320]   and if I did not take that hand, I knew I would die, because I had led myself to this point.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:48.320]   My selfishness and my futile human efforts to be self-sufficient and—yeah, to be self-sufficient and just above everyone else,
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:58.320]   it was so entirely sinful. Even though I was just breaking down in tears at this point, a wave of peace came over me.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:05.320]   And a lot of those things that had been consuming me suddenly didn't really matter anymore.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:12.320]   All that mattered was that I began to understand why God died, and it was truly good news of great joy,
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:18.320]   that he defeated the grave for a desperate and broken sinner who had spent her whole life running away,
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:25.320]   thinking that she could live a life apart from God. He took my sin and endured horrific sorrow so that I wouldn't have to.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:29.320]   I had been forgiven, and it was through no merit of my own.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:35.320]   God had pulled me out of rebellion against him, even though I had been kicking and screaming.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:41.320]   He washed me and justified me and gave me a new heart.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:47.320]   And so from that night on, sanctification and my long road to recovery had begun.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:54.320]   It took many years for my mind to recover, and my body may never recover.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:59.320]   But all of that mattered so much less in the light of my new gift of life and hope.
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:02.320]   I started to find joy in reading the word that I had once despised.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.320]   And on my second day of being a Christian, I was able to make things right with a person that I had formerly hated.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:10.320]   And I was so confused when this was going on. I was like, "What am I doing?"
[01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:19.320]   But I knew that this was God. I knew that the only way that this could happen is because he had changed me.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:26.320]   My priorities and my very identity started to shift, and I was learning how to love my family and repair my relationships with them.
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:33.320]   And I was learning to love the church, how to value kindness and forgiveness instead of clinging to my bitterness and my anger.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.320]   God has continued to soften my heart and give me a love for him and for his people.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:46.320]   And he has been faithful to put me through even more trials since my conversion to refine me even further, and I am grateful for that.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:51.320]   I just want to leave you with one of the first passages I read after I became a Christian.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:59.320]   1 Corinthians 15.10 says, "By the grace of God, I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain."
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:04.320]   It was true for Paul when he wrote it. It's true for me now, and I hope that it is true for you.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.320]   Thank you.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:17.320]   [Applause]
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.320]   Do you want to take off your glasses?
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.320]   Okay.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.320]   [Laughter]
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.320]   She said, "I can't see without them," so she'll keep them on.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.320]   [Laughter]
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:31.320]   All right. Bernard, do you understand that when you go into the water, you're uniting with Christ in his death,
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:37.320]   and as you come out, you're uniting with him in his resurrection so that you too may live a new life.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:46.320]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:04:08.320]   [Applause]
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:15.320]   Hello. My name is Jacob Hahn, and I'm wearing my wife's membership shirt, so it's a little tight, so I apologize.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:18.320]   That was by accident.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:22.320]   So I grew up in a Presbyterian church. I was infant baptized.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:28.320]   I took a baptism class given by Pastor Peter Chung, so thank you, Pastor Peter.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:35.320]   But I'm up here because I'm being baptized because I truly do believe it's biblical, now more than ever,
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:39.320]   and more importantly, it's because that's what my Savior Jesus did.
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:46.320]   I've grown up in church pretty much all my life, but I wasn't saved until I entered high school.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:49.320]   That's when my sheltered suburban life was rocked.
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:54.320]   Up until high school, I thought my parents were happily married, but that was far from the truth.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:58.320]   To this day, I'm unsure what exactly triggered my parents' divorce,
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.320]   but regardless, it was actually the beginning of my journey to salvation.
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:06.320]   When my parents' marriage began to fall apart, I tried to turn to things that the world had to offer,
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:10.320]   but by God's grace, I never went too far off the deep end.
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:14.320]   When I was in ninth grade, I started attending a church, Good Shepherd Presbyterian Church,
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:17.320]   where Pastor Peter Chung was my high school youth pastor.
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:21.320]   I had befriended some good friends who encouraged me to talk to Pastor Peter
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:24.320]   because he, too, had come from a broken home.
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:28.320]   Talking and meeting with Pastor Peter and spending time with my friends at church
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:35.320]   helped me immensely with my difficult situation, but I still had not accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:40.320]   I had grown up knowing that I was a sinner. Jesus loved me, and he had died for my sin,
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:44.320]   but I never believed it and never accepted him into my heart as my Lord and Savior.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:48.320]   I distinctly remember on a Friday night at a praise and prayer night.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.320]   If you went to a Korean church, you know what I'm talking about.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:53.320]   The setting was the lights were dimmed, and it was getting emotional,
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:59.320]   and that's when the praise leader--it was just him and the guitar--and he told the congregation,
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:04.320]   "If there's anybody that's hurting, I want you to put your hands on him and pray for them."
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:09.320]   That's when my best friends Jay and Sam put their hands on me and started praying for me.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:13.320]   It was at that moment I felt this immense conviction in my heart,
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.320]   and that's when I accepted him as Lord and Savior.
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:21.320]   Still to this day, I know God used Jay, Sam, and Pastor Peter to turn me to Jesus.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:27.320]   Though that day started my Christian journey, it took me a while to truly actually understand the gospel.
[01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:30.320]   When I became saved, I quickly began studying, memorizing.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.320]   I was hungry for his word. I'd wake up early in the morning memorizing,
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.320]   but the more I knew, the more legalistic I became.
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:40.320]   I started spitting out verses to my friends when they were doing stuff wrong,
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:46.320]   and I started thinking, after all, I wasn't that bad compared to that guy over in the corner that was committing sinful things.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:52.320]   It wasn't until I transitioned from high school to college when I heard a sermon by Tim Keller preached
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.320]   that I started beginning to understand the gospel a little more.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:07:00.320]   Throughout college, I continued to serve in a leadership capacity,
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:05.320]   and in that way, I think I started thinking that, you know what, I think I'm okay.
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:10.320]   And it wasn't until that I actually transitioned from college to becoming a police officer
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:13.320]   that I truly understand the depravity of my heart.
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:17.320]   I became a police officer for the LAPD during my final two months of my senior year of college.
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:22.320]   I applied during my senior year of college, expecting the hiring process to take a year,
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.320]   but in fact it took four months.
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:29.320]   Due to the recession at the time and the uncertainty of the academies in the future,
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.320]   I was advised to start ASAP.
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:39.320]   So here I was as a college student on Friday, May 24, 2009, and a police officer May 26, 2009, that Monday.
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:43.320]   My transition from a college student to a police officer was an abrupt one.
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:48.320]   The academy wasn't so bad, but when I hit the field, I began to see the world for what it was.
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:52.320]   I did nine of my 11 years in South Central LA, and if you're not familiar with that area,
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:55.320]   that's the birthplace of the Bloods and Crips,
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:08:01.320]   and it is a different world from the comforts of Orange County.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:06.320]   And in my 11 years, I can tell you I've seen several hundred shootings, homicide, violent crimes, you name it.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:09.320]   I won't go into detail. If you want to know, you can talk to me in private,
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:12.320]   and I'll tell you everything because I remember it all.
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:16.320]   And not only that, I was being cussed out and being called every name in the book,
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.320]   and I was changing, and not for the better.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.320]   I was becoming cynical, jaded, and I was becoming angry.
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:27.320]   I wasn't able to attend church because in my first year, you didn't get to choose your schedule, excuse me.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:30.320]   So I would often go months without going to church.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:34.320]   And on top of that, I was becoming angry at church members for how sheltered they were,
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:38.320]   how they were not seeing what was going on only 20, 30 miles away from their homes.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:41.320]   And on top of that, my dating relationships were not working out,
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.320]   and that continued to make me upset and angry.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:47.320]   Even some of my friends started telling me that they didn't like what I was becoming,
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.320]   and they missed the old Jacob.
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:52.320]   My job was changing me instead of Christ changing me.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:57.320]   About two years into my job, something changed, and to this day, I know it was only God.
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:02.320]   I slowly began to realize that I was the worst of all sinners.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:08.320]   Through my transition as a police officer, I began to realize that through my mistakes,
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:17.320]   I was no more deserving of grace than the rapists, child molesters, murders that I arrested.
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:19.320]   How did that happen? I don't know.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:22.320]   All I can say is God was allowing me to see the world through his eyes.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:27.320]   The turning point for me was when I walked into church on a Sunday after missing just months,
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:34.320]   and a particular song was playing, and it said, "I will be still and know you are God."
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:40.320]   And it reminded me of the verse Psalm 46.10, "Be still and know that I am God."
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:45.320]   And I understood, despite my circumstances, the noise and the distractions that were surrounding me,
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:50.320]   he was still God. And as Pastor Peter Kim so beautifully and simply put it a couple weeks ago,
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:54.320]   despite our circumstances, despite what I was going through, the answer is always Christ.
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:59.320]   And I knew that, but that day, it just pierced the depths of my heart.
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:05.320]   And from then on, I've understood that I am, as Paul says, the worst of all sinners.
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:09.320]   My Christian journey is far from over, and I'm still being sanctified.
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:12.320]   Every day is a struggle to seek him and not to things of this world.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:17.320]   Every day I sin, but in the words of Isaac Newton from the movie Amazing Grace,
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:22.320]   as he's getting old, he says, "Although my memory is fading, I remember two things.
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:26.320]   I am a great sinner, and Christ is a great Savior." Thank you.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:37.320]   [applause]
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:40.320]   Oh my God. [laughter]
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:45.320]   Alright, Jacob, do you understand that when you go into the water, you're uniting with Christ in his death,
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:48.320]   and as you come out, you're uniting with Christ in his resurrection?
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:49.320]   Yes.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:58.320]   I baptize you, whew, in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:21.320]   [applause]
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.320]   Hello. Thank you for your patience.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:28.320]   Okay, so, whew.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:33.320]   Hello, my name is Michelle, and this is my testimony.
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:38.320]   I grew up in a Presbyterian Christian home and was also baptized as a baby.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:42.320]   Growing up, I attended church regularly and was taught to be a good person.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:49.320]   I never had a problem with this, as I always liked following the rules and striving to be perfect in everything.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:54.320]   But unfortunately, there was a lot of turmoil at home, and so my parents fought regularly
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:59.320]   until they finally separated and then got divorced when I was in the eighth grade.
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:02.320]   During these two years, my brother and I were separated from my mom.
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:08.320]   I could only see her for brief periods of time due to custody battles and things like that.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:12.320]   And during that time was when bitterness towards God took root in my heart,
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:17.320]   and it revealed the absence of faith and love for God.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.320]   I felt absolutely justified in my anger, thinking that I deserved to be blessed
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:24.320]   because that's the reward I should have received for being good.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:28.320]   But in that year, I moved to a new church where I attended a retreat
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.320]   and fully heard the gospel for the first time.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:37.320]   The words of Ephesians 2, 4-5 highlights the transformation that took place in my heart.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:40.320]   "But God, being rich in mercy because of the great love with which he loved us,
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:44.320]   even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ,
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.320]   by grace you have been saved."
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:50.320]   Once I understood that God loved me so much to the point that he would send his son down for my sake,
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:54.320]   and that in his grace he blessed me with the greatest blessing he could give me,
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:57.320]   I accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior and surrendered my life to him.
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:01.320]   Afterwards, I was confirmed at that church as a genuine believer,
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:08.320]   but as a baby Christian, I didn't understand the significance of publicly professing my faith to the church
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:12.320]   and was simply eager to do so because my mom and church family encouraged me.
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:18.320]   But as I deepened my understanding of the gospel and learned that baptism symbolized the union with Christ
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:23.320]   in his death and resurrection, I realized that being baptized as a baby did not signify that
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:28.320]   because it was not out of my own desire to commit my life to the Lord,
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.320]   but rather an act done by my parents on my behalf.
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.320]   I needed to make that choice and proclaim my faith for myself
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:39.320]   because God had saved me from the depths of my sin when I was completely dead in my trespasses
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.320]   and had given me new life through his Son.
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:46.320]   As it says in Romans 6, 4, "Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death,
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:50.320]   so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father,
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:54.320]   so we too might walk in newness of life."
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.320]   When I was a baby, I was still dead and sin reigned over my life,
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:00.320]   but now I can confidently say I have been crucified with Christ,
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:03.320]   it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me,
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:07.320]   and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.320]   who loved me and gave himself up for me.
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.320]   Thank you.
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:20.320]   [applause]
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:24.320]   Alright, Michelle.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.320]   You're supposed to sit a little bit closer up.
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:28.320]   [laughter]
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.320]   You want to take my left hand?
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:31.320]   Alright, Michelle.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.320]   Do you understand that when you go into the water, you're uniting with Christ in his death,
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:38.320]   and then when you come out of the water, you're uniting with him in his resurrection
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:41.320]   so that you too may walk in the newness of life?
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:47.320]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and Holy Spirit.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:15:01.320]   [applause]
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.320]   Amen.
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:13.320]   Okay, we're going to invite the worship team to come on up,
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.320]   and as they do, just some free beef announcements.
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.320]   What a great time again for us to fellowship,
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:23.320]   and hopefully, especially if some of you guys have been Christian for a long time,
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:27.320]   a great time to remember, reflect upon God's work in our lives
[01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.320]   and the time that we were saved.
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:32.320]   After the service is done, we're going to continue to just fellowship outside.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:33.320]   There is refreshments.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:37.320]   I encourage you guys to stick around, and then again, fellowship with each other.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:41.320]   As you can tell, over here, it's wet and a little slippery.
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:45.320]   After the service is done, although I know you guys want to come up and congratulate
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.320]   and take photos with the people who've been baptized,
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:51.320]   please do so on my left side here or outside in the courtyard,
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:54.320]   but please don't walk around on this area, okay?
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:57.320]   And then finally, again, for those of you who are visiting with us,
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:01.320]   who you're hearing the testimonies, and perhaps you're wondering, curious, wow,
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.320]   what kind of experience do they really have,
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.320]   but you haven't yet experienced that for yourself,
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:09.320]   we really encourage you to come ask, you know,
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:13.320]   to ask the questions about how do you connect with the Lord,
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:16.320]   in what ways are we sinners, what are they talking about when they say forgiveness,
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:19.320]   what are they talking about when they say repentance.
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:20.320]   Please come and ask.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.320]   You'll see the pastors here up in the front, and again, also,
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.320]   we have resources outside with free Bibles and books for you to look at.
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:28.120]   to look at. So again, please visit with us. Thank you.
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:37.860]   [ Silence ]
